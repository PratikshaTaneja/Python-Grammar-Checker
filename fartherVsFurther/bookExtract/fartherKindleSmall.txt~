 Squinting down and sideways I could see one or two people who appeared to be wandering in an odd kind of aimless way farther up the street

 But even to make the setting intelligible I find that I shall have to go back farther than the point at which I started

 Every year we were pushing the northern limit of growth for food plants a little farther back

 And then there were several nurseries of things and experimental stations a little farther out

 Will this little shack serve or do we go farther I asked

 As I stepped outside another door farther down the passage opened

 Don t you think we ought to get farther away Well I was wondering

 We decided to come back and fetch it later and took the empty truck on to another warehouse where we loaded in parcels of blankets rugs and quilts and then went on farther to acquire a noisy miscellany of pots pans caldrons and kettles

 Brought up short by the Sound of the shot they were arguing whether to go on farther or not

 The other two scrambled among the wreckage of the display and came stumbling farther into the shop

 On the farther outskirts of Staines we could begin to feel that London was behind us at last

 A little farther on we turned down a side road to the right and drove into the village of Tynsham

 XI AND FARTHER ON My next morning was desultory

 It clustered at the farther end of a stone bridge which arched across a small sparkling river

 A few miles farther on I ran through a small village which was disposed neatly about a triangular green

 Once we reached the farther side of the valley we were free of floodwater but we made little better speed for the lanes were full of primitive wanderings and improbable turns

 We ran on farther along the lower road

 He groped his way farther on

 A little farther along he discovered a postbox let into the brickwork and knew that he must be actually in the village at last

 I went no farther

 I knew that she was searching for some indication that the source was nearer or farther away anywhere but at Shirning itself

 As we ran farther into the yard we could see the reason

 Now it stands to reason doesn t it that the first country to get on its feet again and put itself in order is also going to be the country to have the chance of bringing order elsewhere Do you suggest that we should leave it for some other country to do this and so make itself the new dominant power in Europe and possibly farther afield Obviously not
