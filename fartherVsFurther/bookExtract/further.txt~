 There was nothing better to be had they might not do so well by looking further for Mrs

 There was no justice there was no right anywhere in it it was only force it was tyranny the will and the power reckless and unrestrained They had ground him beneath their heel they had devoured all his substance they had murdered his old father they had broken and wrecked his wife they had crushed and cowed his whole family and now they were through with him they had no further use for him and because he had interfered with them had gotten in their way this was what they had done to him They had put him behind bars as if he had been a wild beast a thing without sense or reason without rights without affections without feelings

 He laughed to himself as he thought how he would hang on to this job And then one afternoon the ninth of his work in the place when he went to get his overcoat he saw a group of men crowded before a placard on the door and when he went over and asked what it was they told him that beginning with the morrow his department of the harvester works would be closed until further notice Chapter That was the way they did it There was not half an hour s warning the works were closed It had happened that way before said the men and it would happen that way forever

 This did not mean that his arm was strong and that he was able to go back to work but simply that he could get along without further attention and that his place was needed for some one worse off than he

 So Jurgis began without further parley

 After further examination they burned the cardcase and its contents all but the bills and likewise the picture of a little girl in the locket

 He had already inquired of Aniele and learned that Elzbieta and her family had gone downtown and so he gave no further thought to them

 He would not spend a penny save for this and after two or three days more he even became sparing of the bread and would stop and peer into the ash barrels as he walked along the streets and now and then rake out a bit of something shake it free from dust and count himself just so many minutes further from the end

 And Jurgis set out without further ado

 He went back to his thoughts but with one further fact to reckon with that he was caught here

 I will introduce you to some one who will be able to help you as well as I could The messenger had had to go no further than the door he came back followed by a man whom he introduced to Jurgis as Comrade Ostrinski

 When however she had satisfied herself that he was sane upon all subjects except politics she troubled herself no further about it

 The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace that she might be further from the door

 Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry

 I knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them

 Darcy s further notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak

 Collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further and he continued My reasons for marrying are first that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness

 Let me do it without further loss of time

 My situation in life my connections with the family of de Bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into further consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you

 The necessity must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd

 To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further

 The rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again

 He did trace them easily to Clapham but no further for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom

 Give me further particulars

 He begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her

 You may depend upon my seeking no further

 Darcy found on further inquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning

 And is such a girl to be my nephew s sister Is her husband is the son of his late father s steward to be his brother Heaven and earth of what are you thinking Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted You can now have nothing further to say she resentfully answered

 You have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew Unfeeling selfish girl Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody Lady Catherine I have nothing further to say

 When convinced on that article Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish

 From the further disadvantage of Lydia s society she was of course carefully kept and though Mrs

 Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley yet for Elizabeth s sake he assisted him further in his profession

 But at length by Elizabeth s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city

 But of this I shall have occasion to speak further when I come to give the definition and character of true satires

 But Dacier affirms that it is not immediately from thence that these satires are so called for that name had been used formerly for other things which bore a nearer resemblance to those discourses of Horace in explaining of which continues Dacier a method is to be pursued of which Casaubon himself has never thought and which will put all things into so clear a light that no further room will be left for the least dispute

 But this being only the private opinion of so inconsiderable a man as I am I leave it to the further disquisition of the critics if they think it worth their notice

 All that we know further of Menippus and his writings which are wholly lost is that by some he is esteemed as amongst the rest by Varro by others he is noted of cynical impudence and obscenity that he was much given to those parodies which I have already mentioned that is he often quoted the verses of Homer and the tragic poets and turned their serious meaning into something that was ridiculous whereas Varro s satires are by Tully called absolute and most elegant and various poems

 The end and aim of our three rivals is consequently the same but by what methods they have prosecuted their intention is further to be considered

 Upon this account without further insisting on the different tempers of Juvenal and Horace I conclude that the subjects which Horace chose for satire are of a lower nature than those of which Juvenal has written

 I have already declared who are the only persons that are the adequate object of private satire and who they are that may properly be exposed by name for public examples of vices and follies and therefore I will trouble your lordship no further with them

 In Part First Paine had mentioned a rumor that Burke was a masked pensioner a charge that will be noticed in connection with its detailed statement in a further publication and as Burke had been formerly arraigned in Parliament while Paymaster for a very questionable proceeding this charge no doubt hurt a good deal

 Broglio continued lying round the city but made no further advances this day and the succeeding night passed with as much tranquility as such a scene could possibly produce

 I therefore brought it to a close as soon as the subject would admit and reserved what I had further to say to another opportunity

 But she has gone further

 But I might go further and place also foreign wars of whatever kind to the same cause

 In everything which related to the internal affairs of America congress went no further than to issue recommendations to the several provincial assemblies who at discretion adopted them or not

 For example Were a Bill to be brought into any of the American legislatures similar to that which was passed into an act by the English parliament at the commencement of George the First to extend the duration of the assemblies to a longer period than they now sit the check is in the constitution which in effect says Thus far shalt thou go and no further

 The generality of corporation towns are in a state of solitary decay and prevented from further ruin only by some circumstance in their situation such as a navigable river or a plentiful surrounding country

 By the act of By the act be Total If this tax be struck off there will then remain about one million of surplus taxes and as it is always proper to keep a sum in reserve for incidental matters it may be best not to extend reductions further in the first instance but to consider what may be accomplished by other modes of reform

 Some part of this will be required for circumstances that do not immediately present themselves and such part as shall not be wanted will admit of a further reduction of taxes equal to that amount

 By doing this they will not only prevent the further effusion of blood and increase of taxes but be in a condition of getting rid of a considerable part of their present burthens as has been already stated

 Will any man say in the present excess of taxation falling so heavily on the poor that a remission of five pounds annually of taxes to one hundred and four thousand poor families is not a good thing Will he say that a remission of seven pounds annually to one hundred thousand other poor families of eight pounds annually to another hundred thousand poor families and of ten pounds annually to fifty thousand poor and widowed families are not good things And to proceed a step further in this climax will he say that to provide against the misfortunes to which all human life is subject by securing six pounds annually for all poor distressed and reduced persons of the age of fifty and until sixty and of ten pounds annually after sixty is not a good thing Will he say that an abolition of two millions of poor rates to the house keepers and of the whole of the house and window light tax and of the commutation tax is not a good thing Or will he say that to abolish corruption is a bad thing If therefore the good to be obtained be worthy of a passive rational and costless revolution it would be bad policy to prefer waiting for a calamity that should force a violent one

 Pitt s plan it is true goes no further than to a reduction of three hundred and twenty thousand pounds and the reduction proposed in this work to nearly six millions

 And saying this the seer Went through the strait and dreadful pass of death Not ever to be questioned any more Save on the further side but when I met Merlin and asked him if these things were truth The shining dragon and the naked child Descending in the glory of the seas He laughed as is his wont and answered me In riddling triplets of old time and said Rain rain and sun a rainbow in the sky A young man will be wiser by and by An old man s wit may wander ere he die

 Then those who went with Gareth were amazed One crying Let us go no further lord

 But who first saw the holy thing today A woman answered Percivale a nun And one no further off in blood from me Than sister and if ever holy maid With knees of adoration wore the stone A holy maid though never maiden glowed But that was in her earlier maidenhood With such a fervent flame of human love Which being rudely blunted glanced and shot Only to holy things to prayer and praise She gave herself to fast and alms

 There the pursuer could pursue no more And he that fled no further fly the King And there that day when the great light of heaven Burned at his lowest in the rolling year On the waste sand by the waste sea they closed

 Verses In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful HAPPY now the BELIEVERS Who humble them in their prayer And who keep aloof from vain words And who are doers of alms deeds And who restrain their appetites Save with their wives or the slaves whom their right hands possess for in that case they shall be free from blame But they whose desires reach further than this are transgressors And who tend well their trusts and their covenants And who keep them strictly to their prayers These shall be the heritors Who shall inherit the paradise to abide therein for ever

 Is it not notorious to them how many generations through whose abodes they walk we have destroyed before them Truly herein are sings will they not then hear See they not how we drive the rain to some parched land and thereby bring forth corn of which their cattle and themselves do eat Will they not then behold They say When will this decision take place Tell us if ye are men of truth SAY On the day of that decision the faith of infidels shall not avail them and they shall have no further respite

 SAY What think ye If this Book be from God and ye believe it not who will have gone further astray than he who is at a distance from it We will shew them our signs in different countries and among themselves until it become plain to them that it is the truth

 The agitation thrilling through the country and army in consequence of this news was so great that private matters were little heeded and hence probably George Osborne just gazetted to his company busy with preparations for the march which must come inevitably and panting for further promotion was not so much affected by other incidents which would have interested him at a more quiet period

 What is it on the other hand that makes the lawyer eschew his own cause and call in his learned brother as an adviser And what causes the doctor when ailing to send for his rival and not sit down and examine his own tongue in the chimney Bass or write his own prescription at his study table I throw out these queries for intelligent readers to answer who know at once how credulous we are and how sceptical how soft and how obstinate how firm for others and how diffident about ourselves meanwhile it is certain that our friend William Dobbin who was personally of so complying a disposition that if his parents had pressed him much it is probable he would have stepped down into the kitchen and married the cook and who to further his own interests would have found the most insuperable difficulty in walking across the street found himself as busy and eager in the conduct of George Osborne s affairs as the most selfish tactician could be in the pursuit of his own

 I wonder was Lady Jane angry or pleased that her husband at last found fault with his favourite Rebecca Lord Steyne s visits continuing his own ceased and his wife was for refusing all further intercourse with that nobleman and declining the invitation to the charade night which the marchioness sent to her but Sir Pitt thought it was necessary to accept it as his Royal Highness would be there

 I always said she d throw you over he began indeed there were bets in the regiment and at the clubs regarding the probable fate of Colonel Crawley so lightly was his wife s character esteemed by his comrades and the world but seeing the savage look with which Rawdon answered the expression of this opinion Macmurdo did not think fit to enlarge upon it further

 The corporal who the night before had resolved in his mind to supply the grand desideratum of keeping up something like an incessant firing upon the enemy during the heat of the attack had no further idea in his fancy at that time than a contrivance of smoking tobacco against the town out of one of my uncle Toby s six field pieces which were planted on each side of his sentry box the means of effecting which occurring to his fancy at the same time though he had pledged his cap he thought it in no danger from the miscarriage of his projects

 All I contend for is that I am not obliged to set out with a definition of what love is and so long as I can go on with my story intelligibly with the help of the word itself without any other idea to it than what I have in common with the rest of the world why should I differ from it a moment before the time When I can get on no further and find myself entangled on all sides of this mystic labyrinth my Opinion will then come in in course and lead me out

 Before I go further let me get rid of my remark upon Avignon which is this That I think it wrong merely because a man s hat has been blown off his head by chance the first night he comes to Avignon that he should therefore say Avignon is more subject to high winds than any town in all France for which reason I laid no stress upon the accident till I had enquired of the master of the inn about it who telling me seriously it was so and hearing moreover the windiness of Avignon spoke of in the country about as a proverb I set it down merely to ask the learned what can be the cause the consequence I saw for they are all Dukes Marquisses and Counts there the duce a Baron in all Avignon so that there is scarce any talking to them on a windy day

 It has lain there these six weeks replied the corporal till this very morning that the old woman kindled the fire with it Then said my uncle Toby there is no further occasion for our services

 The corporal perceiving my uncle Toby was in the right and that it would be in vain for the wit of man to think of extracting a purer moral from his cap without further attempting it he put it on and passing his hand across his forehead to rub out a pensive wrinkle which the text and the doctrine between them had engender d he return d with the same look and tone of voice to his story of the king of Bohemia and his seven castles

 Now in ordinary cases that is when I am only stupid and the thoughts rise heavily and pass gummous through my pen Or that I am got I know not how into a cold unmetaphorical vein of infamous writing and cannot take a plumb lift out of it for my soul so must be obliged to go on writing like a Dutch commentator to the end of the chapter unless something be done I never stand conferring with pen and ink one moment for if a pinch of snuff or a stride or two across the room will not do the business for me I take a razor at once and having tried the edge of it upon the palm of my hand without further ceremony except that of first lathering my beard I shave it off taking care only if I do leave a hair that it be not a grey one this done I change my shirt put on a better coat send for my last wig put my topaz ring upon my finger and in a word dress myself from one end to the other of me after my best fashion

 As there are fifty different ends counting all ends in as well civil as religious for which a woman takes a husband the first sets about and carefully weighs then separates and distinguishes in her mind which of all that number of ends is hers then by discourse enquiry argumentation and inference she investigates and finds out whether she has got hold of the right one and if she has then by pulling it gently this way and that way she further forms a judgment whether it will not break in the drawing

 Wadman hit upon the fiddlestick which summoned up all my uncle Toby s modest blood into his cheeks so feeling within himself that he had somehow or other got beyond his depth he stopt short and without entering further either into the pains or pleasures of matrimony he laid his hand upon his heart and made an offer to take them as they were and share them along with her

 He hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonnetted without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it

 Further that I require you to bring obedience here

 Peggotty ruffled his hair again with both hands as a further preparation for what he was going to say and went on with a hand upon each of his knees There was a certain person as had know d our Em ly from the time when her father was drownded as had seen her constant when a babby when a young gal when a woman

 I laughed heartily at my own jokes and everybody else s called Steerforth to order for not passing the wine made several engagements to go to Oxford announced that I meant to have a dinner party exactly like that once a week until further notice and madly took so much snuff out of Grainger s box that I was obliged to go into the pantry and have a private fit of sneezing ten minutes long

 Therefore she begged to be excused from any further attendance on the top set until things were as they formerly was and as they could be wished to be and further mentioned that her little book would be found upon the breakfast table every Saturday morning when she requested an immediate settlement of the same with the benevolent view of saving trouble and an ill conwenience to all parties

 After a little further conversation we went round to the chandler s shop to enlist Peggotty Traddles declining to pass the evening with me both because he endured the liveliest apprehensions that his property would be bought by somebody else before he could re purchase it and because it was the evening he always devoted to writing to the dearest girl in the world

 I was encouraged by this closing admission on the part of Miss Mills to ask her whether for Dora s sake if she had any opportunity of luring her attention to such preparations for an earnest life she would avail herself of it Miss Mills replied in the affirmative so readily that I further asked her if she would take charge of the Cookery Book and if she ever could insinuate it upon Dora s acceptance without frightening her undertake to do me that crowning service

 Give me Miss Spenlow s letters to throw in the fire and although our future intercourse must you are aware be restricted to the Commons here we will agree to make no further mention of the past

 Declines to explain further though much pressed

 Don t you think aunt said I after some further contemplation of the fire that you could advise and counsel Dora a little for our mutual advantage now and then Trot returned my aunt with some emotion no Don t ask me such a thing

 For similar reasons I made no allusion to the skirmishing plates upon the floor or to the disreputable appearance of the castors which were all at sixes and sevens and looked drunk or to the further blockade of Traddles by wandering vegetable dishes and jugs

 My aunt further expressed her opinion that if our military friend would cut off those butterflies and give em to the chimney sweepers for May day it would look like the beginning of something sensible on her part

 James would encourage the receipt of letters likely to increase low spirits and unpleasantness but further than that sir I should wish to avoid going

 On further consideration this appeared so likely that I abandoned my scheme which had had a more promising appearance in words than in action resolving henceforth to be satisfied with my child wife and to try to change her into nothing else by any process

 Mutual confidence so long preserved between us once is restored to know no further interruption

 The large wide room with its antique furniture and its faded glory was only gloomily and scantily lighted in the middle by the two wax candles of the candelabrum that Earl Douglas had brought with him while further away it was enveloped in deep gloom and seemed to the eye through this gloom to stretch out to an interminable length

 Well send me to the Tower then and set free the noble Henry Howard that he may henceforth disturb your sleep and poison your days that he may further court the love of the people and perhaps some day rob your son of the throne that belongs to him

 And with respect to that theory of the origin of the forms of life peopling our globe with which Darwin s name is bound up as closely as that of Newton with the theory of gravitation nothing seems to be further from the mind of the present generation than any attempt to smother it with ridicule or to crush it by vehemence of denunciation

 writing to Sir Charles Bunbury under date of April says When Huxley Hooker and Wollaston were at Darwin s last week they all four of them ran a tilt against species further I believe than they are prepared to go

 And I may therefore further suppose that the publication of the Darwin and Wallace papers in and still more that of the Origin in had the effect upon them of the flash of light which to a man who has lost himself in a dark night suddenly reveals a road which whether it takes him straight home or not certainly goes his way

 Prying further into the manuscript I found the record of other doings and sufferings of this singular woman for most of which the reader is referred to the story entitled THE SCARLET LETTER and it should be borne carefully in mind that the main facts of that story are authorized and authenticated by the document of Mr

 Glancing at the looking glass we behold deep within its haunted verge the smouldering glow of the half extinguished anthracite the white moon beams on the floor and a repetition of all the gleam and shadow of the picture with one remove further from the actual and nearer to the imaginative

 We may speak further of it hereafter

 Without further adventure they reached the dwelling of Governor Bellingham

 It was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times

 Pearl accordingly ran to the bow window at the further end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery

 Here is a child of three years old and she cannot tell who made her Without question she is equally in the dark as to her soul its present depravity and future destiny Methinks gentlemen we need inquire no further

 What say you worshipful Master Bellingham Hath he not pleaded well for the poor woman Indeed hath he answered the magistrate and hath adduced such arguments that we will even leave the matter as it now stands so long at least as there shall be no further scandal in the woman

 Let us dig a little further in the direction of this vein Then after long search into the minister s dim interior and turning over many precious materials in the shape of high aspirations for the welfare of his race warm love of souls pure sentiments natural piety strengthened by thought and study and illuminated by revelation all of which invaluable gold was perhaps no better than rubbish to the seeker he would turn back discouraged and begin his quest towards another point

 Then I need ask no further said the clergyman somewhat hastily rising from his chair

 The minister saw nothing further of her motions

 The magistrate after a wary observation of the darkness into which nevertheless he could see but little further than he might into a mill stone retired from the window

 It was perceived too that while Hester never put forward even the humblest title to share in the world s privileges further than to breathe the common air and earn daily bread for little Pearl and herself by the faithful labour of her hands she was quick to acknowledge her sisterhood with the race of man whenever benefits were to be conferred

 And I thee answered Hester Prynne for the hatred that has transformed a wise and just man to a fiend Wilt thou yet purge it out of thee and be once more human If not for his sake then doubly for thine own Forgive and leave his further retribution to the Power that claims it I said but now that there could be no good event for him or thee or me who are here wandering together in this gloomy maze of evil and stumbling at every step over the guilt wherewith we have strewn our path

 This flitting cheerfulness was always at the further extremity of some long vista through the forest

 There was a listlessness in his gait as if he saw no reason for taking one step further nor felt any desire to do so but would have been glad could he be glad of anything to fling himself down at the root of the nearest tree and lie there passive for evermore

 With a hand s breadth further flight it would have fallen into the water and have give the little brook another woe to carry onward besides the unintelligible tale which it still kept murmuring about

 She may be strange and shy at first but will soon learn to love thee By this time Pearl had reached the margin of the brook and stood on the further side gazing silently at Hester and the clergyman who still sat together on the mossy tree trunk waiting to receive her

 Nothing further passed between the mariner and Hester Prynne

 This unhappy man had made the very principle of his life to consist in the pursuit and systematic exercise revenge and when by its completest triumph consummation that evil principle was left with no further material to support it when in short there was no more Devil s work on earth for him to do it only remained for the unhumanised mortal to betake himself whither his master would find him tasks enough and pay him his wages duly

 Several months passed and no further steps were taken by Rome to meet the crisis

 It was carried by a majority that the Emperor should endeavour to have a Council convoked within a year that in the meantime the rulers in whose territories the decree of Worms had been in force should continue to enforce it and that in the states where the new teaching had taken root the rulers were at liberty to allow it to continue but in the interval before the Council they should permit no further changes to be introduced

 In September the Emperor announced that he was endeavouring to procure the convocation of a General Council and that in the meantime the Protestants should return to the old faith a certain time being allowed them for consideration that they should attempt no further innovations or interference with the followers of the old faith that they should restore the ecclesiastical goods which had been seized and that they should unite with the Catholics in opposing the Anabaptists and the Sacramentarians

 In order to procure their assistance Charles was obliged to yield to further demands notably to permit them to suppress the monasteries in their dominions

 The bishops were offered release on condition that they should resign their Sees and pledge themselves to offer no further opposition to the religious change

 took no further steps to bring about reunion he could not be induced to withdraw the liturgy the use of which he insisted upon till his death in 

 At that time everything seemed to indicate its permanent success but soon under the Providence of God the tide began to turn and instead of being able to make further conquests it found it impossible to retain those that had been made

 When the day fixed for the opening ceremony arrived a further adjournment was rendered imperative owing to the very sparse attendance of bishops

 expressed their anxiety to further the project of the Pope

 The question had been adjourned previously at the request of the legates but with the advent of the discussion on the sacrament of Orders further adjournment was impossible

 Thus the foundations of the great Catholic Counter Reformation were laid securely and a movement was begun which stayed the further advance of Protestantism secured the allegiance of individuals and nations that were wavering and won back many who had been seduced from the faith during the early days of the religious upheaval

 and Maximilian of Bavaria to stand firm against the further encroachments of the Lutherans and sympathised actively with the unfortunate Queen of Scotland

 From these colleges went forth young men who were determined to resist the further encroachments of heresy

 This general unexpected revival the success of which was shown by the fervour of the people the unwillingness of the authorities to make any further concessions and the determination of all parties to insist on the strict observance of the Ecclesiasticum Reservatum filled the Protestants with such alarm that their princes began to insist on new guarantees

 The further progress of the Catholic Church in India was impeded by the suppression of the Jesuits the invasion of India by the Dutch the insistence of Portugal upon its rights of patronage over all the churches of India the downfall of the religious spirit in Europe during the eighteenth century and finally by the destruction during the French Revolution of the colleges and religious houses that supplied workers for the mission

 condemned the Chinese Rites and ordered that all missionaries to China should take an oath against further discussion of the question

 As a result of the information acquired from those who returned from this voyage of exploration expeditions were sent out by the French to take possession of the new territories and to erect fortifications against the further advance westward of the English colonists

 in the constitution Sollicitudo omnium Ecclesiarum explained the true meaning of the doctrine and forbade any further opposition to what he declared to be the common and pious belief of the Church

 If by means of this principle Luther and his disciples could reject certain doctrines and practices that had been followed for centuries by the whole Catholic Church why could not others imitating the example that had been given to them set aside many of the dogmas retained by Luther as being only the inventions of men and why could their successors not go further still and question the very foundation of Christianity itself The results of this unbridled liberty of thought made themselves felt in religion in philosophy in politics in literature and in art

 From that time till her death in she took no further part in the discussions

 To further their propaganda without at the same time attracting the notice of the civil authorities the rationalist party had recourse to various devices

 I Though an ill mind appear in simulation And for the most such quality offends Tis plain that this in many a situation Is found to further beneficial ends And save from blame and danger and vexation Since we converse not always with our friends In this less clear than clouded mortal life Beset with snares and full of envious strife

 He meant the ring but further hint forbore Lest dearly he the avowed should abide

 LVI The morn ensuing without further say To his good brother or to man beside He from the city took his reckless way With deadly desperation for his guide Nor save the duke and knight for many a day Was there who knew what moved the youth to ride And in the palace touching this event And in the realm was various sentiment

 But Tis enough that she is vanquished said The pair No further press thy vengeance dread

 No wonder then that he the dame forsook And banished from his mind all further thought Of love for false Alcina found in guise Which no new means of slippery fraud supplies

 XL Fortune what more remains that thou on me Shouldst not now satiate thy revengeful thirst What more she said can I bestow on thee Than what thou seekest not this life accurst Thou wast in haste to snatch me from the sea Where I had ended its sad days immersed Because to torture me with further ill Before I die is yet thy cruel will

 CANTO ARGUMENT So far Orlando wends he comes to where He of old Proteus hears the cruel use But feels such pity for Olympia fair Wronged by Cymosco who in prison mews Her plighted spouse that ere he makes repair Further he gives her hope to venge the abuse He does so and departs and with his spouse Departs Bireno to repeat his vows

 And What more could he say sir cavalier Orlando cried to Sacripant if we Were known for the two basest whores that pull And reel from spindle staff the matted wool XL Then turning to Ferrau But that thine head Thou brutish sot as I behold is bare If thy late words were ill or wisely said Thou should st perceive before we further fare

 VI This dear bought victory brought more relief Than joy by its event too much outweighed The loss of that French captain and our chief Whom dead we on the fatal field surveyed And swallowed in one storm for further grief So many glorious princes who arrayed For safeguard of their own or neighbouring lands Had poured through frozen Alps their friendly bands

 LXXXIX But those philosophers and saints of yore Extinguished who had been his former stay From the good habits he had used before He passed to evil ones began to stray Changing his life at night with lovers bore Thieves company and sinned in every way He oftentimes consorts with Treason further I even have beheld him leagued with Murther

 XLIII Within six miles no further shalt thou light Pursued the hermit on the bloody seat Where dwells a giant horrible to sight Exceeding every stature by eight feet

 Where they might show and without further faring If they had valour equal to their bearing

 For arms and vest more white than virgin snow The coward in the warrior s sight belied And sprang towards him with that joyful Oh By which delight is ever signified But changed his look and tone when nearer brought He sees that he is not the wight he sought LXXIX And through that evil woman s treachery Deemed Gryphon murdered by the cavalier And Tell me he exclaimed thou who must be Traitor and thief both written in thy cheer Whence are these arms and wherefore do I thee View on the courser of my brother dear Say is my brother slaughtered or alive How didst thou him of horse and arms deprive LXXX When Origille hears him in affright She turns her palfrey and for flight prepares But Aquilant more quick in her despite Arrests the traitress ere she further fares

 She would the champion quickly have subdued Though she was gowned he locked in iron case And make him satisfy the Moorish lord If Agramant spake further of accord XLIV And had but that Aurora on his way Ushering aye the sun no sooner stirred Than young Rogero anxious to display That rightfully he bore Jove s beauteous bird To cut the quarrel short and lest delay Be further interposed in act or word Where round the palisade the people close Appears in armour and his bugle blows

 I Madonna who will scale the high ascent Of heaven to me my judgment to restore Which since from your bright eyes the weapon went That pierced my heart is wasting evermore Yet will not I such mighty loss lament So that it drain no faster than before But ebbing further I should fear to be Such as Orlando is described by me

 LII He parts and save that in a caverned cell He dwelt no further news of him were known Meanwhile the harness of that infidel Bradamant hung upon the lofty stone And having thence removed all plate and shell Wherewith as by the writing it was shown The cavaliers of Charles their limbs had drest She moved not nor let other move the rest

 XXXVI Her further meaning well did he divine Weening that him she in that speech would blame For having broke their pact and with design The occasion of his failure to proclaim Of his desire for parley made a sign But she with vizor closed already came Raging and grieved intent with vengeful hand To fling the youth nor haply upon sand

 She that this ample world esteemed at nought Of the Child s friendship had no further care

 May it please Heaven no further loss ensue But if you will pursue your quest I dread Lest not a fourth nor fifth will soon remain And wholly spent will be your wretched train

 So upon Agramant this counsel wrought That king pressed forward without further thought

 Filled is the ditch in haste from shore to shore And forms a level to the further side

 That day no further feats of hardihood Rogero will perform against the foe He but demands of all that make for Arles Who first broke faith King Agramant or Charles LXV From all he hears repeated far and near That Agramant had broke the promise plight He loves that king and from his side to veer For this believes would be no error light

 LXXIII Rogero when from far the ships he spied Believed they were the fleet of Agramant And to know further pricked his courser s side Then nearer mid those knights of mickle vaunt Nasamon s king a prisoner he desired Agricalt Bambirago Farurant Balastro Manilardo and Rimedont Who stood with weeping eyes and drooping front

 LXXVIII If I my will can compass he shall shew His name to me ere further deed be done

 On him Orlando wastes no further pain But sword in hand seeks him of Sericane

 XLVI Impatient to be treated with disdain By me of her more loved than life she said Where she forthwith as mistress to remain Had hoped when thence the other was conveyed Not to behold such present cause of pain Her own departure little she delayed And went so far away no further word By me was ever of that woman heard

 Lo him another accident that falls From sovereign woe to sovereign bliss recalls LXXVIII He saw a peasant who with heavy stake Smote mid some sapling trunks on every side Adonio stopt and wherefore so he strake Asked of the rustic that in answer cried Within that clump a passing ancient snake Amid the tangled stems he had espied A longer serpent and more thick to view He never saw nor thought to see anew LXXIX And that from thence he would not wend his way Until the reptile he had found and slain When so Adonio heard the peasant say He scarce his speech with patience could sustain Aye reverence to the serpent wont to pay The honoured ensign of his ancient strain In memory that their primal race had grown Erewhile from serpent s teeth by Cadmus sown LXXX And by the churl the offended knight so said And did withal he made him quit the emprize Leaving the hunted serpent neither dead Nor injured nor pursued in further wise

 LXXXVI Though to the lady s promise and protest He lent belief and somewhat calmed his fears Until he further hear he will not rest And till he can find matter for his tears A soothsayer he among his friends possest Prized for his knowledge as the first of seers Who of all witchery and of magic art Had read the whole or read the greater part

 LIII But if he give without delay as said His daughter to the son of Constantine If to that promise no regard be paid Which good Rinaldo and the paladine His cousin erst before the hermit made The Marquis Olivier and King Sobrine What shall I do such grievous wrong shall I Endure or rather than endure it die LIV What shall I do her father then pursue On whom for vengeance this grave outrage cries I heed not that the deed is hard to do Or if the attempt in me is weak or wise But presuppose that with his kindred crew Slain by my hand that unjust elder dies This will in nothing further my content Nay it will wholly frustrate my intent

 LXXXI The Greeks in that affray were four to one And with pontoons to bridge the stream supplied And a bold semblance through their host put on Of crossing to the river s further side

 CII Ungiardo had that city in his guard Constantine s liegeman and to him right dear Who since upon the Bulgars he had warred Much horse and foot had sent that emperor here Now entered for the entrance was not barred Rogero and found such hospitable cheer He to fare further had no need in trace Of better or of more abundant place

 XXVIII Oh how she sighs how fears the gentle maid Hearing Rogero as it were was flown Oh how above all other terrors weighed The fear that to forget her he was gone That seeing Aymon still his wish gainsayed And that to wed the damsel hope was none He fled perchance so hoping to be loosed From toils wherein he by her love was noosed XXIX And that with further end the youthful lord Her from his heart more speedily to chase Will rove from realm to realm till one afford Some dame that may his former love efface Even as the proverb says that in a board One nail drives out another from its place

 CVII Joy good Orlando and joy Rinaldo show Who view in valorous Marphisa s plea A cause the alliance shall no further go Which sealed already Leo deemed to be And yet in spite of stubborn Aymon s no Bradamant shall Rogero s consort be And they may without strife without despite Done to Duke Aymon s give her to the knight

 CVIII For if such words have pass d between the twain Fast is the knot and cannot be untied They what they vowed more fairly will obtain And without further strife are these affied

 XVIII Diligent faithful secretary lo The learned Pistophilus mine Angiar here And the Acciajuoli their joint pleasure show That for my bark there is no further fear

 But think not that I further would pursue The hatred that I bore thee and had I When thee I from thy darksome dungeon drew Descried the truth as this I now descry Such treatment shouldst thou then have had as thou Shalt have from me to thine advantage now XLII And if I willingly had done so then When not as I am now obliged to thee How much more gladly should I now and when Not doing so I should with reason be Deemed most ungrateful amid ingrate men Since thou foregoest thine every good for me But I to thee restore thy gift and more Glady than I received it this restore

 LXIX Those envoys of the Bulgars that had made For Charles s court as hath erewhile been shown Hoping to find the knight whose shield pourtrayed The unicorn elected to their throne Bless the good fortune which their hope repayed Seeing that valiant warrior and fall down Before his feet and him in humble speech Again to seek their Bulgary beseech LXX Where kept for him in Adrianople are The sceptre and the crown his royal due But let him succour to his kingdom bear For to their further scathe advices shew Constantine doth a mighty host prepare And thitherward in person moves anew And they of their elected king possest Hope the Greek empire from his hands to wrest

 Take ye no further pains the warrior said For such would be for me a foul excuse

 The Tartar s arms were brought which cut the thread Of more delay and of all further truce With spurs Orlando deck d the youthful lord King Charlemagne begirt him with the sword

 CXXXIX Yet Rodomont so twists and strives he gains The freedom of his better arm anew And with the right hand which his poniard strains For he had drawn his deadly dagger too Would wound Rogero underneath the reins But now the wary youth the error knew Through which he might have died by his delay That impious Saracen forthwith to slay CXL And smiting twice or thrice his horrid front Raising as high as he could raise in air His dagger buried it in Rodomont And freed himself withal from further care

 While still at Dolcoath it is very probable that he put together the little pamphlet which appeared in London at the close of with the title Baron Munchausen s Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia and having given his jeu d esprit to the world and possibly earned a few guineas by it it is not likely that he gave much further thought to the matter

 Hereupon the Poles lighted a fire in the middle of the river which was frozen into a solid mass and in the course of an hour the words which had been frozen up were melted and fell gently upon the further bank although the Muscovite traders had already gone away

 My ball having passed between the two had cut his leading string which the old sow continued to hold in her mouth and as her former guide did not draw her on any longer she had stopped of course I therefore laid hold of the remaining end of the pig s tail and led the old beast home without any further trouble on my part and without any reluctance or apprehension on the part of the helpless old animal

 Here it becomes my duty to acquit him our ship was in a very proper trim till I loaded it with such an immense quantity of bear skins and hams after which it would have been madness to have attempted to proceed further as we were now scarcely able to combat a brisk gale much less those mountains of ice which lay in the higher latitudes

 CHAPTER XV A further account of the journey from Harwich to Helvoetsluys Description of a number of marine objects never mentioned by any traveller before Rocks seen in this passage equal to the Alps in magnitude lobsters crabs c

 As I hovered over the ship I fastened three grappling irons to the tops of the three masts with my sling and fairly lifted her several yards out of the water and then proceeded across to Dover where I arrived in half an hour Having no further occasion for these wings I made them a present to the governor of Dover Castle where they are now exhibited to the curious

 When travellers are solicitous to be the heroes of their own story surely they must admit to superiority and blush at seeing themselves out done by the renowned Munchausen I doubt whether any one hitherto Pantagruel Gargantua Captain Lemuel or De Tott has been able to out do our Baron in this species of excellence and as at present our curiosity seems much directed to the interior of Africa it must be edifying to have the real relation of Munchausen s adventures there before any further intelligence arrives for he seems to adapt himself and his exploits to the spirit of the times and recounts what he thinks should be most interesting to his auditors

 Fearless I advanced against the elephant desirous to take alive the haughty Tippoo Sahib but he drew a pistol from his belt and discharged it full in my face as I rushed upon him which did me no further harm than wound my cheek bone which disfigures me somewhat under my left eye

 He s pretty ripe ain t he Nothing further was said for perhaps a couple of minutes each being busy with his own thoughts then Thompson said in a low awed voice Sometimes it s uncertain whether they re really gone or not seem gone you know body warm joints limber and so although you think they re gone you don t really know

 began Amy gesticulating with unseemly energy but she got no further for Jo quenched her by slamming down the window

 I say isn t bread riz enough when it runs over the pans Sallie began to laugh but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high as they would go which caused the apparition to vanish and put the sour bread into the oven without further delay

 I always said she was a little saint added Meg as if there could be no further doubt of it

 After some delay the object of her desire was procured likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent further loss of time at home and off she drove again well pleased with her own forethought

 A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks and the whole family ate in heroic silence till Mr

 John got no further for Meg cast him off and clasped her hands with a tragic gesture as she fell into a chair exclaiming in a tone of mingled indignation reproach and dismay 

 A call at Meg s and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn still further fortified her for the tete a tete but when she saw a stalwart figure looming in the distance she had a strong desire to turn about and run away

 He could not get any further for he too turned bashful all of a sudden and did not quite know what to say

 Until further information therefore I shall maintain it to be a sea unicorn of colossal dimensions armed not with a halberd but with a real spur as the armoured frigates or the rams of war whose massiveness and motive power it would possess at the same time

 Wooden ships that is possible replied the Canadian but I have never seen it done and until further proof I deny that whales cetaceans or sea unicorns could ever produce the effect you describe

 You have no further doubt captain of the nature of the animal No sir it is evidently a gigantic narwhal and an electric one

 A cry of fury broke from everyone At noon we were no further advanced than at eight o clock in the morning

 Curious curious muttered the Canadian who forgetting his ill temper seemed to submit to some irresistible attraction and one would come further than this to admire such a sight Ah thought I to myself I understand the life of this man he has made a world apart for himself in which he treasures all his greatest wonders

 I have no further objections to make I answered

 But I knew that even in the clearest waters the solar rays could not penetrate further

 Further on was a portion of the globe he might not trample upon

 The fishing ended the provision of air renewed I thought that the Nautilus was about to continue its submarine excursion and was preparing to return to my room when without further preamble the Captain turned to me saying Professor is not this ocean gifted with real life It has its tempers and its gentle moods

 There could be no further doubt

 He saw me and without further preamble began in an amiable tone of voice Ah sir I have been looking for you

 Further on some remains of a gigantic aqueduct here the high base of an Acropolis with the floating outline of a Parthenon there traces of a quay as if an ancient port had formerly abutted on the borders of the ocean and disappeared with its merchant vessels and its war galleys

 Here and there sharp points and slender needles rising to a height of feet further on a steep shore hewn as it were with an axe and clothed with greyish tints huge mirrors reflecting a few rays of sunshine half drowned in the fog

 Generally when we can proceed no further we have return still open to us but here return was as impossible as advance for every pass had closed behind us and for the few moments when we were stationary we were likely to be entirely blocked which did indeed happen about two o clock in the afternoon the fresh ice forming around its sides with astonishing rapidity

 I affirm that not only can the Nautilus disengage itself but also that it can go further still

 Further to the South I asked looking at the Captain

 I have never yet led my Nautilus so far into southern seas but I repeat it shall go further yet

 The Nautilus had gone some miles further up in the night

 As I expected during the night a new block a yard square was carried away and still further sank the immense hollow

 To what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been subjected had she published tnem herself we cannot know

 The grass divides as with a comb A spotted shaft is seen And then it closes at your feet And opens further on

 Her final summer was it And yet we guessed it not If tenderer industriousness Pervaded her we thought A further force of life Developed from within When Death lit all the shortness up And made the hurry plain

 Naturally he did not live so near the clouds as Haydn his rooms were on the third story but he heard somehow of the friendless penniless youth in the attic and immediately resolved to do what he could to further his interests

 Further on we read that the sonatas of Ops

 It is considered unnecessary to detail the services required of the said Joseph Heyden more particularly since his Serene Highness is pleased to hope that he will of his own free will strictly observe not only these regulations but all others that may from time to time be made by his Highness and that he will place the orchestra on such a footing and in such good order that he may bring honour upon himself and deserve the further favour of the Prince his master who thus confides in his zeal and discretion

 Finally this agreement shall hold good for at least three years from May st with the further condition that if at the conclusion of this term the said Joseph Heyden shall desire to leave the service he shall notify his intention to his Highness half a year beforehand

 That the society were not ashamed of themselves is obvious from a further episode

 This commission may be taken as a further evidence of the growing extent of Haydn s fame

 Before Haydn had time to recover from his astonishment Ferdinand was back with a letter of introduction to Prince Castelcicala the Neapolitan Ambassador in London and to show further that the misunderstanding was merely a passing affair he sent the composer later in the day a valuable tabatiere as a token of esteem and regard

 It is further related by Dies that during the bombardment of Vienna in May Haydn seated himself at his instrument every forenoon to give forth the sound of the favourite song

 The Creation Libretto Before proceeding further we may deal finally with the libretto of The Creation

 After a long conversation he informed me says Mr Stuart that being now seventy four years of age and extremely infirm he found himself wholly incapable of further application to study that he must therefore beg leave to decline all offers whether on your part or from any other person whatsoever

 His forbearance with Pleyel who had allowed himself to be pitted against him by the London faction should also be recalled and it is perhaps worth mentioning further that he put himself to some trouble to get a passport for Pleyel during the long wars of the French Revolution

 To Dies he remarked further Supposing an idea struck me as good and thoroughly satisfactory both to the ear and the heart I would far rather pass over some slight grammatical error than sacrifice what seemed to me beautiful to any mere pedantic trifling

 Different editions have different numberings and the confusion is increased by a further re numbering of the piano symphonic scores arranged for two and four hands

 I do hope that you are in perfect health and nothing do I wish more than to see you soon again in Vienna in order to prove further my high esteem

 I hope that you are well which will always be a source of pleasure to me to hear and commending myself to your further friendship and remembrance

 No further letters appear to have been addressed to the lady until Haydn started on his first visit to London in December 

 Further I must plague you once more by asking you to buy at Artaria s my last pianoforte sonata in A flat that is with B flat minor with violin and violoncello and also another piece the fantasia in C without accompaniment for these pieces are not yet published in London but be so good as not to mention this to Herr Artaria or he might anticipate the sale in England

 The rebel borders are pressed still further back and by the complete opening of the Mississippi the country dominated by the rebellion is divided into distinct parts with no practical communication between them

 In my judgment they have aided and will further aid the cause for which they were intended

 The objection to a premature presentation of a plan by the National Executive consists in the danger of committals on points which could be more safely left to further developments

 The following is the Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction referred to in the foregoing Message and further illustrates Mr

 And I do further proclaim declare and make known that whenever in any of the States of Arkansas Texas Louisiana Mississippi Tennessee Alabama Georgia Florida South Carolina and North Carolina a number of persons not less than one tenth in number of the votes cast in such State at the Presidential election of the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty each having taken the oath aforesaid and not having since violated it and being a qualified voter by the election laws of the State existing immediately before the so called act of secession and excluding all others shall reestablish a State government which shall be republican and in no wise contravening said oath such shall be recognized as the true government of the State and the State shall receive thereunder the benefits of the constitutional provision which declares that the United States shall guarantee to every state in this Union a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion and on the application of the legislature or the executive when the legislature cannot be convened against domestic violence

 And I do further proclaim declare and make known that any provision which may be adopted by such State government in relation to the freed people of such State which shall recognize and declare their permanent freedom provide for their education and which may yet be consistent as a temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring landless and homeless class will not be objected to by the National Executive

 And still further that this proclamation is intended to present to the people of the States wherein the National authority has been suspended and loyal State governments have been subverted a mode in and by which the National authority and loyal State governments may be re established within said States or in any of them and while the mode presented is the best the Executive can suggest with his present impressions it must not be understood that no other possible mode would be acceptable

 He further stated in this Proclamation that he had already presented one plan of restoration and that he was unprepared by a formal approval of this bill to be inflexibly committed to any single plan of restoration and was unprepared to declare that the free State Constitutions and Governments already adopted and installed in Louisiana and Arkansas shall be set aside and held for naught thereby repelling and discouraging the loyal citizens who have set up the same as to further effort and unprepared to declare a constitutional competency in Congress to abolish slavery in the States though sincerely hoping that a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery in all the States might be adopted

 The nature of subsequent proceedings on his part must be governed by the success of this that under then existing conditions it was inexpedient in view of further possible complications to forecast further proceedings and especially to attempt to establish at the outset and under the chaotic conditions of the time a general system of reconstruction applicable to all the States and to varying conditions

 We should probably make some modifications prescribe further details there were some suggestions which he should wish to make and he desired all to bring their minds to the question for no greater or more important one could come before us or any future Cabinet

 Thus a Republican and a Democrat were made the nominees of the Convention and its non partisan character found further expression in the first three Resolutions of the Platform adopted which were as follows Resolved st

 The States lately in revolt were prostrate at the feet of the conqueror powerless for further resistance

 The committee not having fully investigated all the charges prepared against the President of the United States it is deemed inexpedient to submit any conclusion beyond the statement that sufficient testimony has been brought to its notice to justify and demand a further prosecution of the investigation

 A large number of witnesses has been examined and everything done that could be to bring the case to a close as appears by the majority report and the majority have come to the conclusion that sufficient testimony had been brought to its notice to justify and demand a further prosecution of the investigation

 of Pennsylvania Resolved That the Committee on the Judiciary to whom was referred the Resolution and Documents relative to the Impeachment of the President be directed to report the evidence at this session with leave to make further report if they shall deem proper

 of Illinois offered the following resolution and demanded the previous question thereon Resolved That the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from the further consideration of the question of the Impeachment of the President of the United States and that the testimony already taken by said committee be printed for the use of the House

 Woodbridge and moved the adoption of the following resolution Resolved That the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from the further consideration of the proposed impeachment of the President of the United States and that the subject be laid upon the table

 Stanton however put an effectual estoppel to further investigation of the charge of corrupt or disloyal disposal of public property by the President

 A construction which denied the power of removal by the President was further maintained by arguments drawn from the danger of the abuse of the power from the supposed tendency of an exposure of public officers to capricious removal to impair the efficiency of the civil service from the alleged injustice and hardship of displacing incumbents dependent upon their official stations without sufficient consideration from a supposed want of responsibility on the part the President and from an imagined defect of guarantees against a vicious President who might incline to abuse the power

 For these reasons I return the bill to the Senate in which House it originated for the further consideration of Congress which the Constitution prescribes

 President in obedience to the order of the House of Representatives we appear before you and in the name of the House of Representatives and of all the people of the United States we do impeach Andrew Johnson President of the United States of high crimes and misdemeanors in office and we further inform the Senate that the House of Representatives will in due time exhibit particular articles of impeachment against hint and make good the same and in their name we demand that the Senate take order for the appearance of said Andrew Johnson to answer said impeachment

 Which order was unlawfully issued with intent then and there to violate the act entitled An Act regulating the tenure of certain civil offices passed March d and with the further intent contrary to the provisions of said act in violation thereof and contrary to the provisions of the Constitution of the United States and without the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States the said Senate then and there being in session to remove said Edwin M

 with intent thereby to induce said Emory in his official capacity as commander of the department of Washington to violate the provisions of said act and to take and receive act upon and obey such orders as he the said Andrew Johnson might make and give and which should not be issued through the General of the army of the United States according to the provisions of said act and with the further intent thereby to enable him the said Andrew Johnson to prevent the execution of the act entitled An act regulating the tenure of certain civil offices passed March second eighteen hundred and sixty seven and to unlawfully prevent Edwin M

 And the House of Representatives by protestation saving to themselves the liberty of exhibiting at any time hereafter any further articles or other accusation or impeachment against the said Andrew Johnson President or the United States and also of replying to his answers which he shall wake unto the articles herein preferred against him and of offering proof to the same and every part thereof and to all and every other article accusation or impeachment which shall be exhibited by them as the case shall require do demand that the said Andrew Johnson may be put to answer the high crimes and misdemeanors in office herein charged against him and that such proceedings examinations trials and judgments may be thereupon had and given as may be agreeable to law and justice ARTICLE X

 Stanton from said office of Secretary for the Department of War and also by further unlawfully devising and contriving and attempting to devise and contrive means then and there to prevent the execution of an act entitled An act making appropriations for the support of the army for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth eighteen hundred and sixty eight and for other purposes approved March second eighteen hundred and sixty seven and also to prevent the execution of an act entitled An act to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel States passed March second eighteen hundred and sixty seven whereby the said Andrew Johnson President of the United States did then to wit on the twentyfirst day of February A

 And this respondent further answering says that by force of the act aforesaid and by reason of his appointment aforesaid the said Stanton became the principal officer in one of the executive departments of the government within the true intent and meaning of the second section of the second article of the Constitution of the United States and according to the true intent and meaning of that provision of the Constitution of the United States and in accordance with the settled and uniform practice of each and every President of the United States the said Stanton then became and so long as he should continue to hold the said office of Secretary for the Department of War must continue to be one of the advisers of the President of the United States as well as the person intrusted to act for and represent the President in matters enjoined upon him or entrusted to him by the President touching the department aforesaid and for whose conduct in such capacity subordinate to the President the President is by the Constitution and laws of the United States made responsible

 And this respondent further answering says he succeeded to the office of President of the United States upon and by reason of the death of Abraham Lincoln then President of the United States on the th day of April and the said Stanton was then holding the said office of Secretary for the Department of War under and by reason of the appointment and commission aforesaid and not having been removed from the said office by this respondent the said Stanton continued to hold the same under the appointment and commission aforesaid at the pleasure of the President until the time hereinafter particularly mentioned and at no time received any appointment or commission save as above detailed

 And this repondent further answering says that on and prior to the th day of August A

 And this respondent further answering says that although a case thus existed which in his judgment as President of the United States called for the exercise of the executive power to remove the said Stanton from the office of Secretary for the Department of War and although this respondent was of the opinion as is above shown that under the Constitution of the United States the power to remove the said Stanton from the said office was vested in the President of the United States and also this respondent was also of the opinion as is above shown that the case of the said Stanton was not affected by the first section of the last named act and although each of the said opinions had been formed by this respondent upon an actual case requiring him in his capacity of President of the United States

 And this respondent further answering says that it is provided in and by the second section of An act to regulate the tenure of certain civil offices that the President may suspend an officer from the performance of the duties of the office held by him for certain causes therein designated until the next meeting of the Senate and until the case shall be acted on by the senate that this respondent as President of the United States was advised and he verily believed and still believes that the executive power of removal from office confided to him by the Constitution as aforesaid includes the power of suspension from office at the pleasure of the President and this respondent by the order aforesaid did suspend the said Stanton from office not until the next meeting of the Senate or until the Senate should have acted upon the case but by force of the power and authority vested in him by the Constitution and laws of the United States indefinitely and at the pleasure of the President and the order in form aforesaid was made known to the Senate of the United States on the th day of December A

 And this respondent further answering says that in and by the act of February it was among other things provided and enacted that in case of vacancy in the office of Secretary for the Department of War it shall be lawful for the President in case he shall think it necessary to authorize any person to perform the duties of that office until a successor be appointed or such vacancy filled but not exceeding the term of six months and this respondent being advised and believing that such law was in full force and not repealed by an order dated August did authorize and empower Ulysses S

 And this respondent further answering says that in further pursuance of his intention and design if possible to perform what he judged to be his imperative duty to prevent the said Stanton from longer holding the office of Secretary for the Department of War and at the same time avoiding if possible any question respecting the extent of the power of removal from executive office confided to the President by the Constitution of the United States and any question respecting the construction and effect of the first section of the said act regulating the tenure of certain civil offices while he should not by any act of his abandon and relinquish either a power which he believed the Constitution had conferred on the President of the United States to enable him to perform the duties of his office or a power designedly left to him by the first section of the act of Congress last aforesaid this respondent did on the th day of December transmit to the senate of the United States a message a copy whereof is hereunto annexed and marked B wherein he made known the orders aforesaid and the reasons which had induced the same

 And this respondent further answering says that this hope not having been realized the President was compelled either to allow the said Stanton to resume the said office and remain therein contrary to the settled convictions of the President formed as aforesaid respecting the powers confided to him and the duties required of him by the Constitution of the United States and contrary to the opinion formed as aforesaid that the first section of the last mentioned act did not affect the case of the said Stanton and contrary to the fixed belief of the President that he could no longer advise with or trust or be responsible for the said Stanton for the said office of Secretary for the Department of War or else he was compelled to take such steps as might in the judgment of the President be lawful and necessary to raise for a judicial decision the questions affecting the lawful right of the said Stanton to resume the said office or the power of the said Stanton to persist in refusing to quit the said office if he should persist in actually refusing to quit the same and to this end and to this end only this respondent did on the st day of February issue the order for the removal of the said Stanton in the said first article mentioned and set forth and the order authorizing the said Lorenzo F

 And for answer to the second article this respondent says that he admits he did issue and deliver to said Lorenzo Thomas the said writing set forth in said second article bearing date at Washington District of Columbia February addressed to Brevet Major General Lorenzo Thomas Adjutant General United States army Washington District of Columbia and he further admits that the same was so issued without the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States then in session but he denies that he thereby violated the Constitution of the United States or any law thereof or that he did thereby intend to violate the Constitution of the United States or the provisions of any act of Congress and this respondent refers to his answer to said first articles for a full statement of the purposes and intentions with which said order was issued and adopts the same as part of his answer to this article and he further denies that there was then and there no vacancy in the said office of Secretary for the Department of War or that he did then and there commit or was guilty of a high misdemeanor in office and this respondent maintains and will insist 

 He further denies that there was no vacancy in said office of Secretary for the Department of War existing at the date of said written authority

 But this respondent in further answer to and in respect of the said allegations of the said eleventh article hereinbefore traversed and denied claims and insists upon his personal and official right of freedom of opinion and freedom of speech and his duty in his political relations as President of the United States to the people of the United States in the exercise of such freedom of opinion and freedom of speech in the same manner form and effect as he has in this behalf stated the same in his answer to the said tenth article and with the same effect as if he here repeated the same and he further claims and insists as in said answer to said tenth article he has claimed and insisted that he is not subject to question inquisition impeachment or inculpation in any form or manner of or concerning such rights of freedom of opinion or freedom of speech or his alleged exercise thereof

 And this respondent further denies that on the st day of February in the year or at any other time at the City of Washington in the District of Columbia in pursuance of any such declaration as is in that behalf in said eleventh article alleged or otherwise he did unlawfully and in disregard of the requirement of the Constitution that he should take care that the laws should be faithfully executed attempt to prevent the execution of an act entitled An act regulating the tenure of certain civil offices passed March by unlawfully devising or contriving or attempting to devise or contrive means by which he should prevent Edwin M

 And this respondent further answering the said eleventh article says that he has in his answer to the first article set forth in detail the acts steps and proccedings done and taken by this respondent to and toward or in the matter of the suspension or removal of the said Edwin M

 And this deponent further answering the said eleventh article denies that by means or reason of anything in said article alleged this respondent as President of the United States did on the st day of February or at any other day or time

 And this respondent further answering the said eleventh article says that the same and the matters therein contained do not charge or allege the commission of any act whatever by this respondent in his office of President of the United States nor the omission by this respondent of any act of official obligation or duty in his office of President of the United States nor does the said article nor the matters therein contained name designate describe or define any act or mode or form of attempt device contrivance or means or of attempt at device contrivance or means whereby this respondent can know or understand what act or mode or form of attempt device contrivance or means or of attempt at device contrivance or means are imputed to or charged against this respondent in his office of President of the United States or intended so to be or whereby this respondent can more fully or definitely make answer unto the said article than he hereby does

 Stanton and reported the same to the Senate which refused to concur in the suspension and Stanton having rightfully resumed the duties of his office the respondent with knowledge of the facts issued an order which is recited for Stanton s removal with intent to violate the act of March to regulate the tenure of certain civil offices and with the further intent to remove Stanton from the office of Secretary of War then in the lawful discharge of its duties in contravention of said act without the advice and consent of the Senate and against the Constitution of the United States

 After the date of this letter and while Judge Black was the counsel of the respondent in this cause he had an interview with the President in which he urged immediate action on his part and the sending an armed vessel to take possession of the island and because the President refused to do so Judge Black on the th of March declined to appear further as his counsel in this case

 He further told me that day being Friday that the next day would be what he called a dies non being the holiday of the anniversary of Washington s birthday when he had directed that the War Department should be closed that the day thereafter would be Sunday and that on Monday morning he should demand possession of the War Department and of its property and if that demand was refused or resisted he should apply to the General in Chief of the Army for a force sufficient to enable him to take possession of the War Department and he added that he dd not see how the General of the Army could refuse to obey his demand for that force

 Sherman At the first interview at which the tender of the duties of the Secretary of War ad interim was made to you by the President did anything further pass between you and the President in reference to the tender or your acceptance of it Mr

 The Chief Justice having indicated an intention to postpone the examination we directed General Thomas to decline giving any bail for further appearance and to surrender himself into custody and announce to the Judge that he was in custody and then present to the Criminal Court an application for a writ of habeas corpus

 Welles whether General Thomas was in possession of the office the President replied that he was and on further question of Welles whether Mr

 Be it further enacted That the headquarters of the General of the Army of the United States shall be at the City of Washington and all orders and instructions relating to military operations issued by the President and Secretary of War shall be issued through the General of the Army and in case of his inability through the next in rank

 That conference developed further that a large majority of the Articles of Impeachment were objectionable to and would not be supported by a number of Republican Senators

 Stanton without further specification of charges

 As but one article had been put to vote and as that was beaten by the lack of a single vote there seemed a further possibility that influences could be brought to bear through the industry of the House as was very soon after developed to secure the support of an anti impeaching Senator on at least one of the articles of impeachment yet to be voted upon

 At all events everything would be hazarded by permitting further immediate action while the situation could be rendered no worse by delay and time and other mollifying conditions and influences might bring changes more promising of success

 Be it Resolved That for the further and more efficient prosecution of the Impeachment of the President the Managers be directed and instructed to summon and examine witnesses under oath to send for persons and papers and employ a stenographer and appoint sub committee to take testimony the expense thereof to be paid from the Contingent Fund of the House

 The demand for adjournment and delay seemed to have been understood by the impeaching majority of the Senate and was of course promptly granted and further voting postponed and the Senate adjourned to May th

 If there were any distinctions between them they were so finely drawn that they amounted simply to a distinction without a difference a characteristic indeed of a large part of the eleven Articles of Impeachment a characteristic so conspicuous that it was not deemed worth while by the majority to go further in their submission to the Court

 So after taking the vote on the Second and Third Articles and their defeat by the same vote as that on the Eleventh it became manifest that further effort to the impeachment of the president on any of the remaining eight Articles would be useless and Mr

 While some of its supporters who had manifestly entered upon the trial with a determination to convict were still insistent for further prosecution had there been a shadow of ultimate success there were others who had begun to realize weeks before the end came the awkwardness of the predicament in which they had allowed themselves and their party to be placed and desired to abandon the enterprise

 It is conspicuous too that while the defense objected to but seven of the interrogatories submitted by the Prosecution and five of them were permitted answer by the vote of the Senate twenty one of the proffers of testimony by the defense were objected to by the prosecution and but nine of them permitted answer and that condition was aggravated by the fact that the numerical strength of the majority party in the Senate was sufficient to determine absolutely the disposition of every question and they could therefore afford to be strictly fair to the accused and by the further fact that the objections to testimony offered in behalf of the defense were as three to one of the objections to testimony offered in behalf of the prosecution

 Sherman to accept the War Office was anything further said in reference to it This was objected to by the prosecution and the vote thereon was to 

 The President then asked General Grant if at the conference on the preceding Saturday he had not to avoid misunderstanding requested General Grant to state what he intended to do and further if in reply to that inquiry he General Grant had not referred to their former conversations saying that from them the President understood his position and that his General Grant s action would be consistent with the understanding which had been reached

 The President further said that the conversation was renewed on the preceding Sunday at which time he asked the General what he intended to do if the Senate should undertake to reinstate Mr

 My own mind suggested a further explanation but I do not remember whether it was mentioned or not namely that it was not supposed by General Grant on Monday that the Senate would decide the question so promptly as to anticipate further explanation between yourself and him if delayed beyond that day

 The butcher who was not sending meat to the vicarage constantly threatened not to come to church and the Vicar was sometimes obliged to make a threat it was very wrong of him not to come to church but if he carried iniquity further and actually went to chapel then of course excellent as his meat was Mr

 But he never got any further

 And heaven only knew what further projects Mr

 With youth s lack of sympathy for an attitude other than its own he despised not a little Weeks and Hayward because they were content with the vague emotion which they called God and would not take the further step which to himself seemed so obvious

 He had passed her with a bow and a few yards further on had seen the Chinaman

 Sometimes when he was standing at the gallery door the man next to him would attempt a conversation but Philip had the country boy s suspicion of strangers and answered in such a way as to prevent any further acquaintance

 He was like an explorer now who has reasoned that certain natural features must present themselves and beating up a broad river finds here the tributary that he expected there the fertile populated plains and further on the mountains

 When he asked for the bill he hazarded a remark which he meant to lead further

 They made further arrangements and then found themselves at the corner of the road in which she lived

 They went further down and the splendid channel a symbol of the great empire broadened and it was crowded with traffic Philip thought of the painters and the poets who had made all these things so beautiful and his heart was filled with gratitude

 His uncle had offered a fold up bed for which now that he no longer let his house in August he had no further use and by spending another ten pounds Philip bought himself whatever else was essential

 There was something fine in keeping to himself these treasures of beauty all his life and giving them to the world disdainfully when he and the world parting company he had no further use for them

 Philip would have liked to drive on further it was distasteful to him to go back to his rooms and he wanted the air but the desire to see the child clutched suddenly at his heartstrings and he smiled to himself as he thought of her toddling towards him with a crow of delight

 Philip s experiences had given him a certain confidence in himself and a different outlook upon many things such a question would have embarrassed him before but now he answered coolly with a deliberate vagueness which prevented further inquiry that private affairs had obliged him to make a break in the curriculum he was now anxious to qualify as soon as possible

 Further on was the gateway that led into King s School and he stood in the quadrangle round which were the various buildings

 Philip s friendship with him had been a motive in the design he was elaborating it was merely sentimental to ignore the fact that the painter was of no further interest to him

 There were several young men who hung about opposite the trade entrance or a little further along at the first corner and the girls coming out two and two or in little groups nudged one another and giggled as they recognised them

 THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF TOAD XI

 Jumping off all his four legs at once in the joy of living and the delight of spring without its cleaning he pursued his way across the meadow till he reached the hedge on the further side

 At last he took refuge in the deep dark hollow of an old beech tree which offered shelter concealment perhaps even safety but who could tell Anyhow he was too tired to run any further and could only snuggle down into the dry leaves which had drifted into the hollow and hope he was safe for a time

 After some further toil his efforts were rewarded and a very shabby door mat lay exposed to view

 A couple of high backed settles facing each other on either side of the fire gave further sitting accommodations for the sociably disposed

 But I ll pass the word around to morrow and I think you ll have no further trouble

 My passages run further than you think and I ve bolt holes to the edge of the wood in several directions though I don t care for everybody to know about them

 At last however when they had gone some considerable way further and were passing some tree stumps at the edge of a copse that bordered the road he stopped and said kindly Look here Mole old chap you seem dead tired

 We might have just gone and had one look at it Ratty only one look it was close by but you wouldn t turn back Ratty you wouldn t turn back O dear O dear Recollection brought fresh waves of sorrow and sobs again took full charge of him preventing further speech

 CAROL Villagers all this frosty tide Let your doors swing open wide Though wind may follow and snow beside Yet draw us in by your fire to bide Joy shall be yours in the morning Here we stand in the cold and the sleet Blowing fingers and stamping feet Come from far away you to greet You by the fire and we in the street Bidding you joy in the morning For ere one half of the night was gone Sudden a star has led us on Raining bliss and benison Bliss to morrow and more anon Joy for every morning Goodman Joseph toiled through the snow Saw the star o er a stable low Mary she might not further go Welcome thatch and litter below Joy was hers in the morning And then they heard the angels tell Who were the first to cry NOWELL Animals all as it befell In the stable where they did dwell Joy shall be theirs in the morning The voices ceased the singers bashful but smiling exchanged sidelong glances and silence succeeded but for a moment only

 I mustn t ask you to do anything further

 The old lady had been prepared beforehand for the interview and the sight of certain gold sovereigns that Toad had thoughtfully placed on the table in full view practically completed the matter and left little further to discuss

 Restlessly the Rat wandered off once more climbed the slope that rose gently from the north bank of the river and lay looking out towards the great ring of Downs that barred his vision further southwards his simple horizon hitherto his Mountains of the Moon his limit behind which lay nothing he had cared to see or to know

 I had everything I could want everything I had any right to expect of life and more and here I am Glad to be here all the same though glad to be here So many miles further on the road so many hours nearer to my heart s desire His shining eyes held fast to the horizon and he seemed to be listening for some sound that was wanting from that inland acreage vocal as it was with the cheerful music of pasturage and farmyard

 THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF TOAD The front door of the hollow tree faced eastwards so Toad was called at an early hour partly by the bright sunlight streaming in on him partly by the exceeding coldness of his toes which made him dream that he was at home in bed in his own handsome room with the Tudor window on a cold winter s night and his bedclothes had got up grumbling and protesting they couldn t stand the cold any longer and had run downstairs to the kitchen fire to warm themselves and he had followed on bare feet along miles and miles of icy stone paved passages arguing and beseeching them to be reasonable

 From rope traces attached to his collar stretched a long line taut but dipping with his stride the further part of it dripping pearly drops

 This canal joins the river some miles further on a little above Toad Hall and then it s an easy walk

 You shall hand me over six shillings and sixpence cash down and further in addition thereto you shall give me as much breakfast as I can possibly eat at one sitting of course out of that iron pot of yours that keeps sending forth such delicious and exciting smells

 The Toad s nervous terrors all returned but the Badger only remarked placidly They ARE going it the Weasels The passage now began to slope upwards they groped onward a little further and then the noise broke out again quite distinct this time and very close above them

 He was indeed an altered Toad After this climax the four animals continued to lead their lives so rudely broken in upon by civil war in great joy and contentment undisturbed by further risings or invasions

 One would appear ridiculous who would say that it is only probable the sun will rise to morrow or that all men must dye though it is plain we have no further assurance of these facts than what experience affords us

 But this decision though it should be favourable to our preceding judgment being founded only on probability must weaken still further our first evidence and must itself be weakened by a fourth doubt of the same kind and so on in infinitum till at last there remain nothing of the original probability however great we may suppose it to have been and however small the diminution by every new uncertainty

 I further thought if now I did deny Those that would have it thus to gratify

 For those which were not for its coming forth I said to them Offend you I am loth Yet since your brethren pleased with it be Forbear to judge till you do further see

 Come neighbour Christian since there are none but us two here tell me now further what the things are and how to be enjoyed whither we are going

 Wherefore Christian was left to tumble in the Slough of Despond alone but still he endeavoured to struggle to that side of the slough that was still further from his own house and next to the wicket gate the which he did but could not get out because of the burden that was upon his back but I beheld in my dream that a man came to him whose name was Help and asked him What he did there CHR

 Now was Christian somewhat at a stand but presently he concluded if this be true which this gentleman hath said my wisest course is to take his advice and with that he thus further spoke

 Legality s house for help but behold when he was got now hard by the hill it seemed so high and also that side of it that was next the wayside did hang so much over that Christian was afraid to venture further lest the hill should fall on his head wherefore there he stood still and wotted not what to do

 Then said Evangelist further Art not thou the man that I found crying without the walls of the City of Destruction CHR

 And said I I am therefore going to yonder gate to receive further direction how I may get to the place of deliverance

 And then was my neighbour Pliable discouraged and would not venture further

 Matt Then I saw in my dream that Christian asked him further if he could not help him off with his burden that was upon his back for as yet he had not got rid thereof nor could he by any means get it off without help

 Timorous answered that they were going to the City of Zion and had got up that difficult place but said he the further we go the more danger we meet with wherefore we turned and are going back again

 Methought those things did ravish my heart I would have stayed at that good man s house a twelvemonth but that I knew I had further to go

 Saw why I went but a little further and I saw one as I thought in my mind hang bleeding upon the tree and the very sight of him made my burden fall off my back for I groaned under a very heavy burden but then it fell down from off me

 Then I saw in my dream that on the morrow he got up to go forward but they desired him to stay till the next day also and then said they we will if the day be clear show you the Delectable Mountains which they said would yet further add to his comfort because they were nearer the desired haven than the place where at present he was so he consented and stayed

 What I promised thee was in my nonage and besides I count the Prince under whose banner now I stand is able to absolve me yea and to pardon also what I did as to my compliance with thee and besides O thou destroying Apollyon to speak truth I like his service his wages his servants his government his company and country better than thine and therefore leave off to persuade me further I am his servant and I will follow him

 Then Apollyon straddled quite over the whole breadth of the way and said I am void of fear in this matter prepare thyself to die for I swear by my infernal den that thou shalt go no further here will I spill thy soul

 Matter said they we were going that way as you are going and went as far as we durst and indeed we were almost past coming back for had we gone a little further we had not been here to bring the news to thee

 Yet the fiends seemed to come nearer and nearer but when they were come even almost at him he cried out with a most vehement voice I will walk in the strength of the Lord God so they gave back and came no further

 I further asked him what house he kept and what other servants he had

 Seeing then that God prefers his religion seeing God prefers a tender conscience seeing they that make themselves fools for the kingdom of heaven are wisest and that the poor man that loveth Christ is richer than the greatest man in the world that hates him Shame depart thou art an enemy to my salvation Shall I entertain thee against my sovereign Lord How then shall I look him in the face at his coming Should I now be ashamed of his ways and servants how can I expect the blessing Mark But indeed this Shame was a bold villain I could scarce shake him out of my company yea he would be haunting of me and continually whispering me in the ear with some one or other of the infirmities that attend religion but at last I told him it was but in vain to attempt further in this business for those things that he disdained in those did I see most glory and so at last I got past this importunate one

 Further by this a man may learn to refute false opinions to vindicate the truth and also to instruct the ignorant

 God forbid that I should jest although I smiled in this matter or that I should accuse any falsely I will give you a further discovery of him

 Then Christian thanked him for his exhortation but told him withal that they would have him speak further to them for their help the rest of the way and the rather for that they well knew that he was a prophet and could tell them of things that might happen unto them and also how they might resist and overcome them

 Then were they remanded to the cage again until further order should be taken with them

 My Lord I have no great acquaintance with this man nor do I desire to have further knowledge of him however this I know that he is a very pestilent fellow from some discourse that the other day I had with him in this town for then talking with him I heard him say that our religion was naught and such by which a man could by no means please God

 Not a step further unless you will do in what I propound as we

 Now at the further side of that plain was a little hill called Lucre and in that hill a silver mine which some of them that had formerly gone that way because of the rarity of it had turned aside to see but going too near the brink of the pit the ground being deceitful under them broke and they were slain some also had been maimed there and could not to their dying day be their own men again

 Then sang Christian By ends and silver Demas both agree One calls the other runs that he may be A sharer in his lucre so these do Take up in this world and no further go

 Then he asked her also what he had best to do further to them

 The next night she talking with her husband about them further and understanding they were yet alive did advise him to counsel them to make away themselves

 Some further and some not so far as these mountains

 What shall we talk further with him or out go him at present and so leave him to think of what he hath heard already and then stop again for him afterwards and see if by degrees we can do any good to him Then said Hopeful Let Ignorance a little while now muse On what is said and let him not refuse Good counsel to embrace lest he remain Still ignorant of what s the chiefest gain

 He further added It is not good I think to say all to him at once let us pass him by if you will and talk to him anon even as he is able to bear it

 I further thought thus If a man runs a hundred pounds into the shopkeeper s debt and after that shall pay for all that he shall fetch yet if this old debt stands still in the book uncrossed for that the shopkeeper may sue him and cast him into prison till he shall pay the debt

 I asked him further how that man s righteousness could be of that efficacy to justify another before God And he told me he was the mighty God and did what he did and died the death also not for himself but for me to whom his doings and the worthiness of them should be imputed if I believed on him

 Then I asked him further how I must make my supplication to him And he said Go and thou shalt find him upon a mercy seat where he sits all the year long to give pardon and forgiveness to them that come

 John Then the water stood in mine eyes and I asked further

 Do you think that I am such a fool as to think God can see no further than I or that I would come to God in the best of my performances CHR

 There was nothing to do as yet further but feel what one had done and our personage felt it while he aimlessly wandered

 What he had further said on the occasion of which we thus represent him as catching the echoes from his own thoughts while he loitered what he had further said came back to him for it had been the voice itself of his luck the soothing sound that was always with him

 When you don t at least he had amended with a further thought see too little

 He remembered to have read as a boy a wonderful tale by Allan Poe his prospective wife s countryman which was a thing to show by the way what imagination Americans COULD have the story of the shipwrecked Gordon Pym who drifting in a small boat further toward the North Pole or was it the South than anyone had ever done found at a given moment before him a thickness of white air that was like a dazzling curtain of light concealing as darkness conceals yet of the colour of milk or of snow

 It disposed for the time of the question but what was next apparent was that it had seen them no further

 Yet the oddity might have been registered as small as compared to the other effect that before they had gone much further she had with her companion to take account of

 Verver it may further be mentioned had taken at no moment sufficient alarm to have kept in detail the record of his reassurance but he would none the less not have been unable not really have been indisposed to impart in confidence to the right person his notion of the history of the matter

 In especial since the birth of their boy in New York the grand climax of their recent American period brought to so right an issue the happy pair struck him as having carried it higher deeper further to where it ceased to concern his imagination at any rate to follow them

 Their rightness the justification of everything something they so felt the pulse of sat there with them but they might have been asking themselves a little blankly to what further use they could put anything so perfect

 As it had served him to satisfy himself so to speak both about Amerigo and about the Bernadino Luini he had happened to come to knowledge of at the time he was consenting to the announcement of his daughter s betrothal so it served him at present to satisfy himself about Charlotte Stant and an extraordinary set of oriental tiles of which he had lately got wind to which a provoking legend was attached and as to which he had made out contentedly that further news was to be obtained from a certain Mr

 XII It was at Brighton above all that this difference came out it was during the three wonderful days he spent there with Charlotte that he had acquainted himself further though doubtless not even now quite completely with the merits of his majestic scheme

 He was acting it kept coming back to that not in the dark but in the high golden morning not in precipitation flurry fever dangers these of the path of passion properly so called but with the deliberation of a plan a plan that might be a thing of less joy than a passion but that probably would in compensation for that loss be found to have the essential property to wear even the decent dignity of reaching further and of providing for more contingencies

 He had put the question on which there was no going back and which represented thereby the sacrifice of his vessels and what he further said was to stand for the redoubled thrust of flame that would make combustion sure

 Delicacy a delicacy more beautiful still all the delicacy she should want reigned between them it being rudimentary in their actual order that she mustn t be further worried until Maggie should have put her at her ease

 The explanation would have been he supposed or would have figured it with less of unrest that Paris had in its way deeper voices and warnings so that if you went at all far there it laid bristling traps as they might have been viewed all smothered in flowers for your going further still

 It could apparently but encourage her further to smile

 Oh it isn t that I hold that I ve a RIGHT to it Charlotte the next instant rather oddly qualified and the observation itself gave him a further push

 She had to explain to him that it was Fanny Assingham she wanted to see who clearly would be there since the Colonel never either stirred without her or once arrived concerned himself for her fate and she had further after Amerigo had met her with See us together why in the world hasn t she often seen us together to inform him that what had elsewhere and otherwise happened didn t now matter and that she at any rate well knew for the occasion what she was about

 To make it now with force for Fanny Assingham s benefit would see her further in the direction in which the light had dawned than any other spring she should yet awhile doubtless be able to press

 The effect of it as well was an arrest for Charlotte whose face however all of whose fine and slightly hard radiance it had caused the next instant further to brighten

 The Ambassador using authority as well had already somehow possessed himself of her hand which he drew into his arm and she was further conscious as she went off with him that though still speaking for her benefit Amerigo had turned to Fanny Assingham

 It may indeed be further mentioned that the more Fanny looked at it the more she saw in it

 It only appears to me of great importance that now that you all seem more settled here Charlotte should be known for any presentation any further circulation or introduction as in particular her husband s wife known in the least possible degree as anything else

 Isn t it rather as if we had Charlotte and I for bringing us together a benefactor in common And the effect for his interlocutress was still further to be deepened

 This further in its way was a step toward reflecting that when one s connection with any matter was too indirect to be traced it might be described also as too slight to be deplored

 And don t my dear she further answered think it necessary to be horrid or low about them

 Or must you do it in three guesses like forfeits on Christmas eve To which as his ribaldry but dropped from her he further added How much of anything will have to be left for you to be able to go on with it I shall go on Fanny Assingham a trifle grimly declared while there s a scrap as big as your nail

 There was at first even for the young man no faint flush in the fact of the direction taken while he happened to look out by a slow jogging four wheeled cab which awkwardly deflecting from the middle course at the apparent instance of a person within began to make for the left hand pavement and so at last under further instructions floundered to a full stop before the Prince s windows

 If anything could further then have added to it the renewed pause outside as if she had said to the man Wait a moment would have constituted this touch

 He busied himself with this care and she sat down on his pushing up a low seat where she had been standing so that while she talked he could bring her what she further desired

 Oh it s further than that goes and if I ve had a better day than you it s perhaps when I come to think of it that I AM braver

 He considered this a while in his restless way but with his eyes not turning from her after which rather disconnectedly though very vehemently he brought out How can I not feel more than anything else how they adore together my boy And then further as if slightly disconcerted she had nothing to meet this and he quickly perceived the effect They would have done the same for one of yours

 She had in a word not only mounted cheerfully the London treadmill she had handsomely professed herself for the further comfort of the three others sustained in the effort by a frivolous side if that were not too harsh a name for a pleasant constitutional curiosity

 What further propped up the case moreover was that the world by still another beautiful perversity of their chance included Portland Place without including to anything like the same extent Eaton Square

 He went in fact a step further than Charlotte put the latter forward as creating his necessity

 XXII It was quite for the Prince after this as if the view had further cleared so that the half hour during which he strolled on the terrace and smoked the day being lovely overflowed with the plenitude of its particular quality

 It further passed across him as his imagination was for reasons during the time unprecedentedly active that he had after all gained more from women than he had ever lost by them there appeared so more and more on those mystic books that are kept in connection with such commerce even by men of the loosest business habits a balance in his favour that he could pretty well as a rule take for granted

 What in fact most often happened was that her rightness went as who should say even further than his own they were conscious of the same necessity at the same moment only it was she as a general thing who most clearly saw her way to it

 Yet the effect of this small crisis oddly enough was not to close their colloquy with the natural result of sending them to bed what was between them had opened out further had somehow through the sharp show of her feeling taken a positive stride had entered as it were without more words the region of the understood shutting the door after it and bringing them so still more nearly face to face

 Assingham noted a limit unless indeed as yet so far as she has come and if she comes no further simply to the suspicion and the dread

 For that while he stared his wife allowed him time at the end of which she simply said No Then what on earth are they up to Still however she only looked at him so that standing there before her with his hands in his pockets he had time further to risk soothingly another question

 Assingham further explained by so much as she took her young stepmother for this purpose away from Mr

 It made her in fact with a vague gasp turn away and what had further determined this was the final sharp extinction of the inward scene by the outward

 Her thought over this arrived at a great intensity had indeed its pauses and timidities but always to take afterwards a further and lighter spring

 She asked herself at present if it had been a real belief that they were but wanting for some such adventure to snatch their moment whether either had at any instant seen it as workable save in the form of a toy to dangle before the other that they should take flight without wife or husband for one more look before they died at the Madrid pictures as well as for a drop of further weak delay in respect to three or four possible prizes privately offered rarities of the first water responsibly reported on and profusely photographed still patiently awaiting their noiseless arrival in retreats to which the clue had not otherwise been given away

 Such a proposal on his lips such an extravagance of optimism would be HIS way of being consistent for that he didn t really want to move or to move further at the worst than back to Fawns again could only signify that he wasn t at heart contented

 What occurred was simply that she became aware at a stroke of the quantity of further nourishment required by her own and of the amount of it she might somehow extract from these people whereby she rose of a sudden to the desire to possess and use them even to the extent of braving of fairly defying of directly exploiting of possibly quite enjoying under cover of an evil duplicity the felt element of curiosity with which they regarded her

 Still more unexpectedly the service might have been the same for her father inasmuch as immediately when everyone had gone he did exactly what she had been waiting for and despairing of and did it as he did everything with a simplicity that left any purpose of sounding him deeper of drawing him out further of going in his own frequent phrase behind what he said nothing whatever to do

 He was terrified of the retort he might have invoked What my dear if you come to that is the matter with YOU When a minute later on he had followed up his last note by a touch or two designed still further to conjure away the ghost of the anomalous at that climax verily she would have had to be dumb to the question

 We want each other he had further explained only wanting it each time FOR each other

 They were face to face again now and she saw she had made his colour rise it was as if he were still finding in her eyes the concrete image the enacted scene of her passage with Charlotte which he was now hearing of for the first time and as to which it would have been natural he should question her further

 It came back therefore to his pretending but she had gone far enough and to add to her appearance of levity she further observed that though they were so far from a novelty she should also immediately desire at Fawns the presence of the Assinghams

 Assingham further proceeded of what the deuce I can fit it on TO

 Yet she remained for an instant embarrassed as to a further advance

 Assingham considered further

 We re talking of good innocent people deeply worked upon by a horrid discovery and going much further in their view of the lurid as such people almost always do than those who have been wider awake all round from the first

 This second occasion had given way for a long time in her happy life to other occasions all testifying in their degree to the quality of her husband s blood its rich mixture and its many remarkable references after which no doubt the charming piety involved had grown on still further grounds bewildered and faint

 It was with her managed quietness more and more that she talked an achieved coherence that helped her evidently to hear and to watch herself there was support and thereby an awful harmony but which meant a further guidance in the facts she could add together

 Something exquisite faintly eager in the prompt simplicity of it supported her friend further

 Aren t you and your husband in spite of everything Maggie s eyes still further if possible dilated

 That effect itself somehow prompted her to further freedom and presently to saying I don t believe in this you know

 And she meanwhile however abjectly simple was further discerning for herself that whatever he might have to take from her she being on her side beautifully free he would absolutely not be able for any qualifying purpose to name Charlotte either

 Then after an instant and only after an instant as she saw he made out what she meant and it gave her all strangely enough the still further light that Charlotte for herself knew as little as he had known

 Maggie s lighted eyes at least looked further than they had ever looked

 There reigned for her absolutely during these vertiginous moments that fascination of the monstrous that temptation of the horribly possible which we so often trace by its breaking out suddenly lest it should go further in unexplained retreats and reactions

 The splendid shining supple creature was out of the cage was at large and the question now almost grotesquely rose of whether she mightn t by some art just where she was and before she could go further be hemmed in and secured

 She was unable at the minute of course fully to measure the difference thus involved for her and it remained inevitably an agitating image the way it might be held over her that if she didn t of her own prudence satisfy Charlotte as to the reference in her mocking spirit of so much of the unuttered and unutterable of the constantly and unmistakably implied her father would be invited without further ceremony to recommend her to do so

 Yes Charlotte had seen she was watching her from afar and had stopped now to put her further attention to the test

 She doesn t the Princess further adventured quite so much mind their being wicked

 If everything were different she further presented her thought of course everything WOULD be

 It could pass further for knowing for knowing that without him nothing might have been which would have been missing least of all

 Oh we re all right A declaration launched not only with all her discriminating emphasis but confirmed by her rising with decision and standing there as if the object of their small excursion required accordingly no further pursuit

 Do you know Mag what you make me wish when you talk that way And he waited again while she further got from him the sense of something that had been behind deeply in the shade coming cautiously to the front and just feeling its way before presenting itself

 Verver had gone still further with the increase of the oddity moreover of her having exchanged the protection of her room for these exposed and shining spaces

 Maggie could make that out as well as further however that her second impression of her friend s approach had an instant effect on her attitude

 With which Maggie further said Of course I understand

 But why wasn t it still left to push further and from the point of view of personal pride grovel lower why wasn t it still left to offer herself as the bearer of a message reporting to him their friend s anguish and convincing him of her need She could thus have translated Mrs

 For they promptly enough felt these yearnings of thought and excursions of sympathy the concussion that couldn t bring them down the arrest produced by the so remarkably distinct figure that at Fawns for the previous weeks was constantly crossing in its regular revolution the further end of any watched perspective

 Assingham went further

 And even this he added as the Principino appearing alone deep within piped across an instant greeting even this isn t altogether failure They went in to receive the boy upon whose introduction to the room by Miss Bogle Charlotte and the Prince got up seemingly with an impressiveness that had caused Miss Bogle not to give further effect to her own entrance

 We need further to determine the effect of this contemplative attitude upon the several mental processes involved the act of perception itself with its grasp of manifold relations the flow of ideas the partial resurgence and transformation of emotion

 Intellectual and aesthetic activity further differentiated

 A further reason for including it is that the evolution of art supplies a most valuable auxiliary criterion of degree or height of aesthetic value

 Yet aesthetic emotion is to be contrasted with the more violent and passionate state of love and other emotions and this difference calls for further investigation

 A system of norms must further supply some comprehensive criterion by help of which degrees of aesthetic value may be determined as determined by the degrees of completeness of the several pleasurable activities sensuous perceptual and imaginative and justify the form of judgment this object is more beautiful or of a higher kind of beauty than that

 The further elucidation of this element of humanizing influence in aesthetic enjoyment may be expected to throw new light on the question much discussed throughout the history of aesthetics of the relation of the science to ethics by showing that they have a common root in our sympathetic nature and interest in humanity

 They were content with a knowledge of the truth of the principle of gravitation instead of essaying to explain it further by the properties of a transmitting medium they in fact modelled the whole of their natural philosophy on that principle and tried to express all kinds of material interaction in terms of laws of direct mechanical attraction across space

 This raises the further question as to whether the transmission of gravitation can be definitely recognized among the properties of an ultimate medium if so we know that it must be associated with some feature perhaps very deep seated or on the other hand perhaps depending simply on incompressibility which is not sensibly implicated in the electric and optical activities

 With reference to all such further refinements of theory it is to be borne in mind that the perfect fluid of hydrodynamic analysis is not a merely passive inert plenum it is also a continuum with the property that no finite internal slip or discontinuity of motion can ever arise in it through any kind of disturbance and this property must be postulated as it cannot be explained

 But at present we are considering the relations of shipowner and shipper independently of any express contract as in a case when goods are shipped and received to be carried to the place to which the ship is bound for a certain freight but without any further agreement as to the terms of carriage

 it is further qualified to this extent that the shipowner is not liable for loss happening without his actual fault or privity by fire on board the ship or by the robbery or embezzlement of or making away with gold or silver or jewellery the true nature and value of which have not been declared in writing at the time of shipment and further the shipowner is not laable for damage to or loss of goods or merchandise beyond an aggregate amount not exceeding eight pounds per ton for each ton of the ship s tonnage

 When the ship is disabled and cannot proceed or she is prevented by some obstacle from proceeding to the place of delivery named in the bill of lading and the shipowner is unwilling or unable to forward the goods by another ship even though he may be excused for his failure to carry the goods to their destination he is not entitled to be paid any part of the freight and the consignee is entitled to have the goods delivered to him either at the place where the vessel has taken refuge in her disabled condition or if the obstacle arises without disablement of the vessel at the place which is nearest and most reasonably convenient at the time and in the circumstances when the further prosecution of the voyage has to be abandoned

 The effect of the clause is that when the charterers have shipped a full cargo they have fulfilled all their obligations the shipowner discharging them from all further liability and taking instead a lien on the cargo for payment of all freight demurrage or dead freight that may be payable to him

 The shipowner is further secured by the stipulation already referred to that if the total freight payable under the bills of lading is less than the full chartered freight the difference shall be paid to the shipowner before the vessel sails

 On the one hand he knew he did not want a further sensual experience something deeper darker than ordinary life could give

 Day by day the tissue of the sick man was further and further reduced nearer and nearer the process came towards the last knot which held the human being in its unity

 And yet now every day the great red hot stroke of horrified fear through the bowels of the son struck a further inflammation

 Don t come any further with me she said in her barely audible voice

 I don t want you any further

 Don t come any further she said

 He did not believe in his own single self any further than this

 It seemed as if her heart in her breast were a second unconquerable sun into the glow and creative strength of which he plunged further and further

 One has a hankering after a sort of further fellowship

 But she only pressed her face further into his shoulder in pain like a child that cannot tell

 He is a good many stages further than either you or I can go

 Yes but stages further in what cried Gerald irritated

 Stages further in social hatred he said

 He s further on than we are

 She admired and despised her sister so much both Then suddenly she averted her face saying coldly uglily Well I ve got no further than love yet

 She felt strange and inevitable as if she were centred upon the pivot of all existence there was no further reality

 Then in a slow mood she asked How much do you love me He stiffened himself further against her

 She had further to go a further slow exquisite experience to reap unthinkable subtleties of sensation to know before she was finished

 I didn t want it really was the last confession of disgust in his soul as he drifted up the slope weak finished only sheering off unconsciously from any further contact

 He might have lived with his friend a further life

 He had been ever loyal to Lear whom he had honoured as a king loved as a father followed as a master and he had never esteemed his life further than as a pawn to wage against his royal master s enemies nor feared to lose it when Lear s safety was the motive nor now that Lear was most his own enemy did this faithful servant of the king forget his old principles but manfully opposed Lear to do Lear good and was unmannerly only because Lear was mad

 All this the good lady related to Helena highly praising the virtuous principles of her discreet daughter which she said were entirely owing to the excellent education and good advice she had given her and she further said that Bertram had been particularly importunate with Diana to admit him to the visit he so much desired that night because he was going to leave Florence early the next morning

 Helena prevailed on the widow and Diana to accompany her to Paris their further assistance being necessary to the full accomplishment of the plan she had formed

 Now then he suffered her to proceed on her journey but further to try if this yielding humour would last he addressed an old gentleman they met on the road as if he had been a young woman saying to him Good morrow gentle mistress and asked Katherine if she had ever beheld a fairer gentlewoman praising the red and white of the old man s cheeks and comparing his eyes to two bright stars and again he addressed him saying Fair lovely maid once more good day to you and said to his wife Sweet Kate embrace her for her beauty s sake

 I desire further to express my appreciation of a particular kindness done to me by Colonel R

 Melliquiniby his captain general seeing how much labour was being spent in a thing so impossible made ready two ships in a port of Charamaodell which he loaded with much gold and precious stones and forged some despatches as of an embassy sent in the name of the king of the island in which he professed his obedience and sent presents and after this the king did not proceed any further with his causeway

 Firishtah does not relate that any further campaign was at that time initiated and we are therefore free to suppose that the Muhammadans were unable to press their advantage

 The throne was set with precious stones of great value and being still further enriched by subsequent sovereigns was at one time valued at four millions sterling

 greatly improved the city of Vijayanagar raising fresh walls and towers increasing its extent and building further lines of fortification

 mentions the name Deva Raya but gives no further royal titles than the BIRUDA Lord of the four oceans

 Kulbarga was itself in too troubled a condition to venture on further national complications

 The Rajah submitted and purchased his immunity from further interference on the part of the Sultan by a present of some valuable elephants

 We have some further information on the affairs of Kulbarga during the reign of Muhammad Shah in the writings of the Russian traveller Athanasius Nikitin but it is very difficult to fix the exact date of his sojourn there

 At Cannanore the viceroy s son Lourenco in received further information as to the state of the country from the Italian traveller Varthema and in consequence of this Almeida asked King Narasa to allow him to erect a fortress at Bhatkal but no answer was returned

 The king further built the temple of Hazara Ramasvami near or in his palace enclosure at the same time

 It appears as if it hardly concerned then further than that at its close Ruy de Mello seized the mainlands near Goa

 Were it not that the description given us by Nuniz and Paes of the condition of the great city of Vijayanagar at this period is so graphic so picturesque and so detailed as positively to require no addition I should have deemed it my duty to attempt to supply the want but with their narrative before us in all its original freshness it would be useless to attempt anything further

 As soon as Narsenaque heard that he was dead and learned that he himself was supposed to have sent to kill him he raised up another brother of the late King s to be king not being able further to punish this captain because he had many relations until after he had raised this younger brother to be king who was called Tamarao

 The captain further said that after he had persuaded the King to this he would cause him to leave the city and while going out he would kill him and that in this way Narsenaque should become king

 And the Ydallcao as a cloak to his action gave Dabull to that Cide by way of showing that he was not near his person nor knew he aught of him from which town of Dabull Cide fled nor had they any further news of him

 As soon as they brought news to the King that the Ydallcao had passed the river he commanded all to make ready but that no movement should take place in his army till he should see how the enemy acted and when they brought him further news that the enemy had pitched his camp and strengthened his position he ordered a general advance of all his forces

 In these the chiefs told the King that he ought to content himself with having defeated the Ydallcao as he had done and ought not to wage further war they begged him of his goodness to return to the Ydallcao that which he had so taken from him and that if he did so they would always obey whatever he commanded but if he was not of a mind to this then he must know for certain that they would be compelled to turn against him and forthwith join the Ydallcao for whom they would speedily recover that which he had now lost

 As regards the Ydallcao what I have done to him and taken from him he has richly deserved as regards returning it to him that does not seem to me reasonable nor am I going to do it and as for your further statement that ye will all turn against me in aid of him if I do not do as ye ask I pray you do not take the trouble to come hither for I will myself go to seek ye if ye dare to await me in your lands and this I send you for answer

 Thus he took counsel with his advisers putting before them how secure his position was if he had the friendship of the King that if allied to him he might be able to still further increase the greatness of his State and that with the King s favour he would be able to carry out all his wishes

 And he further left in his will that he should take Billgao and should make war on the Ydallcao

 The Ydallcao was very glad and made a peace with him which was to last for a hundred years on condition that the King should give him ten LAKHS of gold PARDAOS each LAKH being PARDAOS and further should yield up to him the city of Rachol which the King Crisnarao had taken from him and which had a revenue with its lands of PARDAOS as well as jewels which could easily be valued at a LAKH

 The Rebels now saw that we were not to be run over like a field of cornstalks and they fell back to devise further tactics giving us a breathing spell to get ourselves in shape for defense

 Before going any further in this narrative it may be well to state that the nomenclature employed is not used in any odious or disparaging sense

 These evidences we accepted as sufficient demonstration that there was a woman at the bottom of the mystery and made us more impatient for further developments

 The Rebels constructed a powerful iron clad called the Albemarle at a point further up the Roanoke and on the afternoon of the th with her and three brigades of infantry made an attack upon the post

 He knew no art of government no method of discipline save kill them His petty little mind s scope reached no further

 This was further illustrated by the important fact that hospital gangrene or a disease resembling it in all essential respects attacked the intestinal canal of patients laboring under ulceration of the bowels although there were no local manifestations of gangrene upon the surface of the body

 Still further there was nothing to see anywhere or to form sufficient inducement for any one to make so laborious a journey

 We concluded to take the chances and ascending the bank we walked and ran as fast as we could for about two miles further

 This was further illustrated by the important fact that hospital gangrene or a disease resembling this form of gangrene attacked the intestinal canal of patients laboring under ulceration of the bowels although there were no local manifestations of gangrene upon the surface of the body

 In this case Nature was protesting by a rebellion of the tastes against any further use of that species of food

 There was still another pile of these same kind of pieces of board lying at the further side of the prison

 Resolved That whereas in the fortune of war it was our lot to become prisoners we have suffered patiently and are still willing to suffer if by so doing we can benefit the country but we must most respectfully beg to say that we are not willing to suffer to further the ends of any party or clique to the detriment of our honor our families and our country and we beg that this affair be explained to us that we may continue to hold the Government in that respect which is necessary to make a good citizen and soldier

 This gave us good riddance of our dangerous enemies and we had little further trouble with any of them

 Soon how ever they returned and informed us that they would be compelled to take us to the County Jail to await further orders from the Military Commander of the District

 The other guards heard this conversation and thinking it all right I was allowed to pass without further trouble

 No one thought they would have any further use for such things

 Only some eight or ten were sent to the train and these quartered themselves in the caboose and paid us no further attention

 Still further resembling the French grandes seigneurs of the eighteenth century they rolled in wealth wrung from the laborer by reducing the rewards of his toil to the last fraction that would support his life and strength

 We halted him and told him that we were Rebs who had taken a French leave of Thomasville that we were tired of guarding Yanks and were going home and further that we were hungry and wanted something to eat

 The taking of this testimony occupied until October when the Government decided to close the case as any further evidence would be simply cumulative

 He further claimed that there was no principle of law which would sanction the holding of him a mere subordinate guilty for simply obeying as literally as possible the orders of his superiors

 After wandering for a while she got frightened and ran and ran little knowing that she was going further away from her home at every step

 Please go a little further off

 Mo poke mo poke croaked the Nightjar further and further in the distance as it flew away

 For a few seconds it hesitated to make the attack and looked back down the slope to see if the other dogs were coming to help but they were only just beginning the ascent and the shouting black fellows were further off still

 Then in the hollows of her little hands she collected it and dashed it over the Kangaroo s parched tongue and further instructed by the kindly though rude little bird she had soon well wetted the suffering animal s fur

 A great deal more was said but the oldest bower bird thinking that all the adjectives were getting used up told the frogs and crickets to start the music again so as to keep the excitement going and all further observations were drowned in the noise

 For further explanations and proofs of statements herein contained I would refer them to my larger work

 Further investigation has prompted me to make some alterations but only a few in matters of detail

 Luther s further Work Writings and Inward Progress until VI

 Luther s further Sojourn at the Wartburg and his Return to Wittenberg III

 As to the childhood of Martin Luther and his further growth and mental development at Mansfeld and elsewhere we have absolutely no information from others to enlighten us

 As to what concerns further the positive religious influence which he exercised over his children any such impressions as he might have given by what he said of the Count of Mansfeld were fully counterbalanced by the severity and firmness of his paternal discipline

 Luther in not yielding further to those influences remained a German

 He was terribly distressed also a few months after he had taken his degree as Master by the sudden death of one of his friends not further known to us who was either assassinated or snatched away by some other fatality

 He sent me an answer in writing addressing me in terms that showed his displeasure and renouncing all further affection

 But it was also taught that the sinner by his own natural strength both could and ought to do enough in God s sight to earn that grace which would then help him further on the way to heaven

 In these also he states that his task was imposed upon him by a distinct command he frankly confessed that as yet he was insufficiently acquainted with the Psalms a comparison of his notes and lectures shows further how continually he was engaged in prosecuting these studies

 His further sermons and writings show how deeply he was imbued with its contents

 The intimate connection between the conclusions to which the views of Tauler tended and the principles from which Luther started is shown further by the superior attraction which those sermons so warmly recommended by Luther continued to exercise upon members of the Evangelical compared with those of the Catholic Church

 He further had printed in for Christian readers generally an explanation of the seven penitential psalms

 We have seen how Luther as a student associated with the young Humanists at Erfurt and now whilst striving further on that road of theology which he had marked out for himself he was still accessible to the general interests of learning as represented by the Humanistic movement

 Paul as to human sin and righteousness by faith and further that he made even the errors of the Church which should be a source of genuine sorrow to every Christian a subject of ridicule

 Further on Luther declares When true repentance is awakened in a man full absolution from punishment and sin comes to him without any letters of indulgence

 From henceforth Luther while pursuing with unabated zeal his active duties at the university and in the pulpit at Wittenberg and taking up his pen again and again to write short pamphlets of a simple and edifying kind occupied himself untiringly with controversial writings with the object partly of defending himself against attacks partly of establishing on a firm basis the principles he had set forth and of further investigating and making plain the way of true Christian knowledge

 it is our desire that you will further his safe return here and not allow him to be delayed

 As to any argument however about the theses to be retracted Caietan refused from the first to engage in it and undoubtedly he went further in that direction than he originally desired or intended

 Luther could only beg from him further time for consideration

 Luther added further that an appeal would be drawn up for him in the form best fitted to the occasion

 He further hinted to his Wittenberg friends at the possibility of his having to go elsewhere in exile indeed his friends already thought of taking him to Paris where the university still rejected the doctrine of Papal absolutism

 Luther however to whom the Elector showed this letter at once declared himself ready to go into exile but would not be deterred from publishing new declarations or taking further steps

 Already in the solutions to his theses he had incidentally and without attracting further notice by the remark spoken of a time when the Papacy had not yet acquired supremacy over the Universal Church thereby contradicting what the Romish Church maintained and had made into a dogma namely that the Papal see possessed this primacy by original institution through Christ and by means of immutable Divine right

 He himself declared to Luther that for the last hundred years no business had caused so much trouble at Rome as this one and that they would gladly there give ten thousand ducats to prevent its going further

 Personally he desired to desist from further strife but silence must also be imposed on his adversaries

 By Luther too we hear him often spoken of afterwards in terms of affectionate remembrance he tells us of his kindness and courtesy to everyone of his efforts to attract around him trusty and capable servants from all ranks of his apt remarks of his tact in jest and in earnest further of the troubles he had in his government of the Empire and with his princes of the insolence he had to put up with from the Italians and of the humour with which he speaks of himself and his imperial rule

 For the Pope however these considerations were of further import for in his dealings with the new Emperor he had to proceed at least with caution since the latter was aware that he had done his best to prevent his election

 Miltitz meanwhile had further prosecuted his scheme without revealing his own ultimate object

 He shuddered so he wrote to his friends when in reading the Papal decretals he looked further into the doings of the Popes with their demands and edicts into this smithy of human laws this fresh crucifixion of Christ this ill treatment and contempt of His people

 He has stipulated further that for reasons touching himself the report of this disputation shall not be submitted for approval to the Papal court

 Some days later and after further consideration Luther produced four propositions of Huss which were perfectly Christian although they had been formally rejected by the Council

 He would grant further that the decisions of a Council in matters of faith must at all times be accepted

 For five whole days they contested this main point of the disputation without arriving at any further result

 He followed up his fancied victory by further exciting the people against Luther and pointing out to them in particular the sympathy between him and Huss

 On all the points which he had wished to contend for and expound at Leipzig he now published further explanations

 Miltitz however notwithstanding the result of the disputation and the further declarations of Luther still clung to his plan of mediation

 LUTHER S FURTHER WORK WRITINGS AND INWARD PROGRESS UNTIL 

 In clear and earnest language he explained how faith itself on which everything depended was a matter of innermost moral life and conduct nay the very highest work conformable to God s will and further how that same faith cannot possibly remain merely passive but on the contrary the faithful Christian must himself become pleasing to God on whose grace he relies must love Him again and fulfil His holy Will with energy and activity in all duties and relations of life

 He will not however have the conscience further laden with duties imposed by the Church for which no corresponding moral obligation exists

 Measures however were now taken by the Romish Church and its representatives which by attacking the word as he preached it drove him further into the battle

 When the episcopal missive from Stolpen threatened to make the storm break out afresh he sent by Spalatin an urgent exhortation to Luther to restrain his pen and further advised him to send letters of explanation in a conciliatory spirit to Albert Archbishop of Magdeburg and Mayence and the Bishop of Merseburg

 We shall see how this same standpoint from which this learned man still retained his inward sympathy with Church matters dictated further his attitude towards Luther and the Reformation

 How much more forcibly must the thoughts have recurred to him when the news arrived of the impending decision at Rome of the warning received from there by the Elector and of the protest uttered even in Germany and by such a prince as Duke George of Saxony against any further toleration of his proceedings

 As he reviewed in the course of the contest the proceedings of his enemies and was further informed of the conduct of the Papal see the picture of corruption and utter worthlessness nay the antichristian character of the Church system at Rome unfolded itself more and more painfully and fully before his eyes

 But the most important demand advanced by Luther while pushing further his inquiries into the moral and social regulations and condition of the Church is the abolition of the celibacy of the clergy

 He would further give full liberty to quit such institutions at pleasure

 The dangers which threatened Luther and through him also the honour and prosperity of his Order affected further his companions and friends who belonged to it

 Whereas further in true baptism he had vowed to dedicate his whole life and conduct to God other vows of human invention were now demanded of him

 He makes it clear that nothing was further from his intention than to appease the angry Pontiff by any dexterous artifices or concealments

 As for the historical retrospect which Miltitz wanted and which Luther briefly appends to this letter all that the latter says in vindication of himself is that it was not his own fault but that of his enemies who had driven him further and further onward that no small part of the unchristian doings at Rome had been dragged to light

 The whole tone and tenor of this dedication so tranquil fervent and tender shows further what profound peace reigned in the soul of this vehement champion of the faith and what happiness the excommunicated heretic found in his God

 If we consider the powerful influences then at work to further the ecclesiastical movement in Germany it seems reasonable to suppose that they would succeed in accomplishing its ends through the power of the Word alone without any such bloodshed and political convulsions as were feared and that Germany therefore though vexed with spiritual tempests the tumult and uproar whose outburst Luther already discerned must inevitably rid herself of the forms and fetters of Romish Churchdom by the sheer force of her new religious convictions

 And indeed even in the short interval since Luther had commenced and only with slow steps had advanced further in the contest a success had been attained which no one at the beginning could have ventured to expect or even hope for

 If he retracted them he should be heard further on other points and matters and dealt with in all equity upon them

 If on the contrary he persisted in all or any of the articles at variance with the faith then all the Estates of the Empire should without further disputation adhere to and help to maintain the faith handed down by their fathers and the imperial edict should then go abroad throughout the land

 It remained still doubtful however how far those articles would be extended and how far the other points might be stretched or possibly be made the subject of further and profitable discussion if he submitted in respect to the former

 He answered in a low voice and as if frightened that the books were his but that since the question as to their contents concerned the highest of all things the Word of God and the salvation of souls he must beware of giving a rash answer and must therefore humbly entreat further time for consideration

 The majority insisted on attempting further negotiations with him through a Committee specially appointed

 For the liberation of the laity from the Papal yoke he set at once further to work by composing a treatise On Confession whether the Pope has power to order it

 Just at this time new forces had stepped in to further the work and the battle

 Then came the stirring and disquieting news of his sudden kidnapping by the powers of darkness rumours which only served to stimulate him further in his concealment to speak out and march forwards with undaunted courage and assurance

 It was further insisted that like as at ordinary meals the elements should be given into the hand of each individual to partake of and not put into his mouth by the priest

 He declared further with regard to private masses that he was resolved never to say any more while he lived

 LUTHER S FURTHER SOJOURN AT THE WARTBURG AND HIS RETURN TO WITTENBERG 

 But the most important task that Luther now undertook and in which he persevered with steadfast devotion during his further stay at the Wartburg was one of a peaceful character the most beautiful fruit of his seclusion the noblest gift that he has bequeathed to his countrymen

 Carlstadt went further and denounced the pictures and images in the churches it was not enough to desist from worshipping them nor durst it be hinted that they served as books for the instruction of laymen

 Under the influence of his preaching the Elector could now quietly allow matters in Wittenberg and the neighbourhood to shape their further course in quiet

 Luther s further writings against the Romish Churchdom and dogma do not possess the same interest for us as his earlier ones inasmuch as they no longer show the progress and development of his own views on the Church

 Further a minority of the German princes including in particular Ferdinand of Austria and the Dukes William and Louis of Bavaria entered into a league at Ratisbon to execute the Edict of Worms while agreeing to certain reforms in the Church according to a Papal scheme proposed by his nuncio Campeggio

 Luther wrote to the new Duke I am greatly rejoiced that Almighty God has so graciously and wondrously helped your princely Grace to attain such an eminent position and further my wish is that the same merciful God may continue His blessing to your Grace through life for the benefit and godly welfare of the whole country

 Just as here the simple Word was to achieve the victory so his whole efforts were devoted solely to restoring to the congregations the possession and enjoyment of that Word in all its purity that they might gather round it and be thereby further edified sustained and guided

 In the course of the same year he brought out a further collection of twenty hymns written by himself for the evangelical congregation there among these is the one on the Brussels martyrs

 He insisted further on the study of history and especially of that of Germany

 A further cause of this decline of academical studies was to be found no doubt in the vigorous and somewhat giddy bound taken by trade and commerce in those days of increased communication and extensive geographical discovery and in the striving after material gain and enjoyment which seemed to find satisfaction in other ways more easily and rapidly than by learned industry and the pursuit of culture

 And to those who wavered in so momentous a decision and shrank back from it and the contests it involved there was plenty in what they observed among Luther s adherents to give them occasion for still further reflection

 And the very last year of his life in a letter to Luther recommending to him a young theologian who was about to further his education at Wittenberg he assured him of his unchanging love passing the love of women Sam

 Luther in this went further than did afterwards the Evangelical Church that bears his name

 In respect to the battle against Catholic Churchdom and dogma the controversy between Luther and Erasmus presents no new issue or further development

 The discussion he held with them led to no success and he gave up any further attempt to convince them for as he said they burned like a fire as if they longed to devour him

 As for the peasants he had never from the first concealed from them his suspicions that many of them only pretended to appeal to Scripture and offered for mere appearance sake to be further instructed therein

 He declared further at the close of his new and forcible remarks on the use of the sword that Christian authorities at any rate were bound if victorious to show mercy not only to the innocent but also to the guilty

 Luther justified their escape in a public letter addressed to Koppe and collected funds for their support until they could be further provided for

 What further considerations induced him to marry appear from his letters in which he urged his friends to do likewise

 His enemies seized the occasion of his marriage to spread vulgar falsehoods about him which soon were further exaggerated and have been raked up shamelessly again even in our own time or at least repeated in veiled and scandalous inuendoes

 Of the wedding feast of June we have no further details

 And the Catholic nobles took advantage of this rising to persecute with the greater rigour all evangelical preaching and to extend without further inquiry their denunciation of the insurgents to those of evangelical sympathies who held entirely aloof from the insurrection

 The Elector now found a further ally for the work in the Landgrave Philip of Hesse the most active and politically the most important of all

 Among the particular labours which occupied Luther during the further course of the year apart from his persevering industry as a professor and preacher we have already had occasion to mention one namely his reply to Erasmus

 had entirely changed his Church principles and to hope that if only he could make amends for the personal offence he had given him Henry might be won over still further for the Evangelical cause

 Concerning the answer which came afterwards from King Henry as well as the reply of Erasmus we shall speak further on

 We shall follow later on the further course of the controversy

 The bishops in their visitations in Saxony under the Elector Frederick had been unable to check any longer the progress of the new teaching and did not venture on any further interference

 And it was only a step further for those authorities to forbid any public exposition of doctrines which they found to be at variance with the Word of God and to appoint also preachers of that Word nay to undertake in short the establishment and preservation of the constitution of the Church so far as the same was external and necessary and incapable of being established by any other power

 He suggested further that ministers advanced in years or unfit to preach but otherwise of pious life and conduct should be instructed to read aloud in person or by deputy the Gospel together with the Postills or short homilies

 They began their labours at once in the district to which Wittenberg belonged but of their proceedings here nothing further is known

 Melancthon however who had followed the university to Jena was commissioned meanwhile to prepare provisionally some regulations and instructions for further action in this matter and in August Luther received the articles which he had drafted for his examination and approval

 The conversion of the sinner he declared must proceed solely and entirely from the comforting knowledge of God s love and grace as revealed in His message to man thence further and thence alone came the proper fear of God a fear not of His punishment but of Himself

 His German Mass of said The first thing wanted for German public worship is a rough simple good Catechism and further on in that treatise he declared that he knew of no better way of imparting such Christian instruction than by means of the Ten Commandments the Creed and the Lord s Prayer for they summed up briefly and simply almost all that was necessary for a Christian to know

 In the doctrine concerning the person of the Redeemer a point to which the controversy further led the Church had hitherto affirmed simply a union of the Divine and human natures each retaining the attributes and qualities peculiar to itself

 Luther after reading the last mentioned treatises of Zwingli and Oecolampadius resolved to publish one answer more the last for Satan he said must not be suffered to hinder him further in the prosecution of other and more important matters

 He concluded with a short summary of his own confession of Christian faith that men might know both then and after his death how carefully and diligently he had thought over everything and that future teachers of error might not pretend that Luther would have taught many things otherwise at another time and after further reflection

 Further on he rebuked the princes for letting matters go on as if they had no concern in them instead of advising and assisting the Emperor with all the means in their power

 They succeeded in passing a resolution or article declaring that those States which had held to the Edict of Worms should continue to impose its execution on their subjects the other States should abstain at least from further innovations

 Further steps in the exercise of this power could easily be anticipated

 But they were neither strengthened further nor enlarged

 All further proceedings were stopped at once and everyone hurried away with his guests

 Meanwhile Luther was anxious to respond still further to the call of duty against the Turks

 But just as in his first pamphlet he had called on the authorities in virtue of their appointment by God to protect their own people against the enemy so he now wished further to make all German Christians strong in conscience and full of courage to take the field under their banner according to God s command

 At Coburg where they arrived on the th they expected to receive further news as to the day fixed for the actual opening of the Diet

 A few days later he enlarged further on this sportive simile in a letter to his Wittenberg table companions i

 He endeavoured further to appeal to the Archbishop s conscience as a German

 Luther then would not only not hear of surrender but looked upon as useless any further negotiations in matters of belief

 In his own peculiar manner he expressed himself once to Br ck the chancellor of the Saxon Elector his temporal adviser at Augsburg and a man who did much to further the Reformation

 The Emperor meanwhile engaged to bring about the meeting of a Council within a year for the removal of real ecclesiastical grievances but reserved until that period the consideration of what further steps should eventually be taken

 On the strength of this view Butzer the theological representative of Strasburg sought to make further overtures to the Wittenbergers

 This fortunate beginning encouraged Butzer to further attempts which he made afterwards in private

 He deemed it sufficient at present that each party should desist from writing against the other and wait until perhaps God if they ceased from strife should vouchsafe further grace

 Ferdinand in vain sought to conclude a treaty of peace with the Sultan who demanded him to surrender all the fortresses he still possessed in a part of Hungary and reserved the right of making further conquests

 The main dispute was on the further question how far this recognition should extend whether only to the Schmalkaldic allies the immediate parties to the present agreement or to such other States of the Empire as might go over to the new doctrine from the old Church which still remained the established Church of the Emperor and the Empire in general and perhaps further to Protestant subjects of Catholic princes of the Empire

 With regard to the further question as to the princes who should hereafter join the Protestants it certainly sounds naive to hear Luther speak of a present mere act of favour on the part of the Emperor

 The negotiations above described involved the further question about a Council pending which a peaceful agreement was now effected

 How could the Pope possibly tolerate a free Christian Council when he must be quite aware how disadvantageous such a Council would be to himself Luther s advice was briefly summed up in this to restrict themselves to the bare formalities of speech required and to wait for further events

 Further quarrelling was ended by the two princes agreeing in November to settle certain matters in dispute and their theologians also were commanded to keep at peace

 Meanwhile the Schmalkaldic allies clung tenaciously to their league and were intent on still further strengthening their position and preparing themselves for all emergencies

 And in the interests and for the objects represented by the league namely to oppose a sufficiently strong and compact power to Roman Catholicism and its menaces those further attempts were now made to promote internal union among the Protestants to which Butzer had so unremittingly devoted his labours and which the Landgrave Philip among the princes considered of the utmost value

 He abstained from entering into any further controversy against the substance of doctrines opposed to his own

 This kingdom was demolished the next year by the combined forces of the Emperor and the bishop but a further consequence of their defeat was the exclusion of Protestantism from the city which submitted again to episcopal authority

 But they could not be persuaded further than to admit that Christ s Body was really present in the Sacrament as food for the souls of those who partook in faith

 These letters plainly show how glad was Luther now to see the good cause so advanced and to be able to further it yet more

 Luther declared after reading the Confession which they brought that certain expressions in it were objectionable but added a wish that the Strasburgers would treat with them further the subject and the latter led him to hope that the communities in Switzerland weary of dispute desired unity

 Butzer sought to work with them further in the same direction

 They that is to say the magistrates and clergy of Zurich Berne Basle and some other towns were content to express their joy at Luther s present friendly state of mind together with a hope of future unity and besought Butzer to inform Luther further about their own Confession and their objections to his own

 He did not wish to induce him to make any further explanations and promises but his whole mind was bent upon mutual forgiveness and bearing with one another in patience and gentleness

 Butzer who in regard to unity of confession and his relations with the Swiss had not been able to have any further conversation with Luther at Schmalkald had at once on receiving the good news from Tambach gone straight to Luther at Gotha accompanied by the preacher Wolfhart from Augsburg

 When Bullinger expressed his surprise that he should still talk of a difference in doctrine he gave up offering any more explanations on the subject and the Swiss for their part after his second letter made no further attempt to effect a more perfect agreement

 On this very account he was loth to rake up the difference again by further explanations

 But Luther saw in it nothing more that was essential such as would necessitate further controversy or deter him from friendly intercourse with these pious minded people

 Of Luther s love for his German mother language and of the services he rendered it so conspicuously shown by these his writings and especially by his persevering industry in his translation of the Bible we are further reminded by a request he made in a letter of March to his friend Wenzeslaus Link at N remberg

 He was restrained however from taking further steps by the Elector of Brandenburg and other of Albert s influential relatives who appealed to John Frederick on his behalf whilst Albert sought to make a cheap compensation to the family of the murdered man or at least pretended to do so

 To those who might perhaps have taken exception to his words he says I sit here at Wittenberg and ask my most gracious lord the Elector for no further favour or protection than what is given to all alike

 The personal vanity however which was the chief weakness of this gifted intellectual and fairly eloquent man and which was now increased by the dissatisfaction it had caused at Eisleben displayed itself further in the assertion of his eccentricities of dogma

 Luther now launched a sharp reply against these antinomian theses as well as against others which went much further and whose origin is unknown

 The Elector testified to him his displeasure Luther gave a sharp answer to the charge and his prince made further inquiries into the matter of complaint

 And further with respect to God s will and the operation of His grace whereby alone the sinner could obtain inward conversion and faith he wished to make this depend entirely on man s own will and choice so that the blame might not appear to lie with God if the call to salvation remained fruitless and a temptation thereby be offered to many to indulge in carelessness or despondency

 And it had been permitted him to see the Reformation gain strength and make further progress in the German Empire

 And yet there was no lack of discord difficulty and trouble within the pale of the new Church and amongst its members prospects of further and possibly much more serious dangers to be encountered thoughts of sadness and disquietude to vex the soul of the Reformer now aged suffering and weary

 He would then incur no further personal danger

 The Diet at Hagenau made no further demand on Luther s activity

 It was there resolved to take in hand again at another meeting to be held at Worms late in the autumn and after further preparation the religious and ecclesiastical questions at issue

 At Worms the proceedings in which Melancthon and Eck took a prominent part were further adjourned to a Diet which the Emperor purposed to hold in person at Ratisbon early in 

 Moreover the collocutors themselves were unable to agree when they came to further questions as for example the Mass and Transubstantiation they still shipwrecked therefore on those points which were of the most vital importance for the external glorification of the priesthood and the Church and the surrender of which would have meant the sacrifice of a dogma already ratified by a Conciliar decree

 These hopes he expressed with peculiar assurance in a small Latin tract written during these later years of his life in which he treats of Biblical chronology and further of the epochal years in the history of the world

 This year passed by without any further or greater literary labour on his part

 He launched out with vehemence against them in in some further tracts inveighing mainly against the dirty insults and savage blasphemies which the brazen faced Jews dared to employ towards Christ and Christians and also against the usurers in whose toils the Christians were ensnared

 He meditated also revising and further improving the most important of his sermons which have been left to posterity

 At this time Luther had two orphan nieces living with him Lene and Else Kaufmann of Mansfeld sisters of Cyriac whom we found with him at Coburg and also a young relative of whom we know nothing further than that her name was Anna

 He further bade her pay off the debt which was still owing probably for the house amounting to about gulden because with the exception of his few treasures he had no money to leave her

 He once sought as we have seen to practise turning with him but of this nothing further is related

 Further he puts before the Pope his cardinals and followers who forsooth needed no admonition for their detestable iniquities

 He further occupied himself in writing a sequel to his first book against the Papacy and at the same time meditated a letter against the Sacramentarians

 They should at any rate wait and see until the thoughts of hearts should be further revealed

 Extended in a continuous line for a distance of above a hundred miles with an average elevation of from to feet and steepest on its eastern side it formed a wall against which the waves of eastern invasion naturally broke a bulwark which seemed to say to them Thus far shall ye go and no further

 Nothing in the conformation of the strata or in the lie of ground indicates the coming marvel the roots of Lebanon and Hermon appear to intermix and the further progress of the river seems to be barred by a rocky ridge stretching across the valley from east to west when lo suddenly the ridge is cut as if by a knife and a deep and narrow chasm opens in it down which the stream plunges in a cleft feet deep and so narrow that in one place it is actually bridged over by masses of rock which have fallen from the cliffs above

 Further down the chasm deepens first to and then to feet the torrent roars in the gorge milk white and swollen often with the melting snow overhung with semi tropical oleanders fig trees and oriental planes while the upper cliffs are clad with northern vegetation two zones of climate thus being visible at once

 Still further north between Byblus and Tripolis the bold promontory known to the ancients as Theu prosopon and now called the Ras esh Shakkah is still unconquered and the road has to quit the shore and make its way over the spur by a wearisome ascent at some distance inland

 It may be urged in favour of the Ph nicians that long continued commercial success is impossible without fair dealing and honesty that where there is commercial fair dealing and honesty those qualities become part and parcel of the national character and determine national policy and further that in almost every one of the instances of bad faith alleged there is at the least a doubt of which the accused party ought to have the benefit

 A further enlargement was effected by means of substructions thrown out into the sea probably on two sides towards the east and towards the south

 The other towns might furnish sailors to man the Tyrian fleet or merchandise for their cargo but it was Sidon first and then with even more determination and endurance Tyre which took the initiative and the conduct of the movement it was the mariners of these two towns who with eyes fixed on the setting sun pushed their explorations as far as the Pillars of Hercules and eventually even further

 Further reference will be made to it in the Chapter on the sthetic Art of the Ph nicians

 Still further to the west in the centre of the bay enclosed between the promontories of Zeugari and Boosoura was the colony of Curium on a branch of the river Kuras

 The town was situated on a rocky elevation feet in height and was further defended by a strong wall a large portion of which may still be traced

 The Atlas mountains rose in the background with their picturesque summits while in front were seen the blue Mediterranean with its crisp waves merging into the wilder Atlantic and further off the shores of Spain lying like a blue film on the northern horizon

 The Ph nician occupation of the site is witnessed to by Strabo Diodorus Scymnus Chius Mela Pliny Velleius Paterculus lian and Arrian and is further evidenced by the numerous coins which bear the legend of Agadir in Ph nician characters

 The northern wall was built of masonry from the very foundation the southern consisted for a portion of its height of the native rock while above that were several courses of stones carrying it up further

 Nothing is known of the internal arrangements unless we attach credit to the views of the savant Gerhard who in the early years of the present century constructed a plan from the reports of travellers in which he divided the building into a nave and two aisles with an ante chapel in front and a sacrarium at the further extremity

 It is quite possible nay probable that the trade extended much further and certain that it must have included many other articles of commerce besides those which we have mentioned

 There was one further direction in which the Ph nicians pushed their maritime trade not perhaps continuously but at intervals when their political relations were such as to give them access to the sea which washed Asia on the south and on the southeast

 Whether it likewise produced almug trees is doubtful and it is quite possible that the joint fleet went further than Ophir proper and obtained the almug wood from the east coast of Africa or from India

 This custom was grounded in part on the notion that children were the dearest possession of their parents and in part that as pure and innocent beings they were the offerings of atonement most certain to pacify the anger of the deity and further that the god of whose essence the generative power of nature was had a just title of that which was begotten of man and to the surrender of their children s lives

 But where the Corinthians themselves were on the left they gained a decided success the scanty forces of the Corcyraeans being further weakened by the want of the twenty ships absent on the pursuit

 Further there is promptitude on their side against procrastination on yours they are never at home you are never from it for they hope by their absence to extend their acquisitions you fear by your advance to endanger what you have left behind

 Thus it happens that the vast experience of Athens has carried her further than you on the path of innovation

 Their intention was not to offer a defence on any of the charges which the cities brought against them but to show on a comprehensive view that it was not a matter to be hastily decided on but one that demanded further consideration

 If we undertake the war without preparation we should by hastening its commencement only delay its conclusion further a free and a famous city has through all time been ours

 Vote therefore Lacedaemonians for war as the honour of Sparta demands and neither allow the further aggrandizement of Athens nor betray our allies to ruin but with the gods let us advance against the aggressors

 The Lacedaemonians when assault failed to take the place apprehensive of the enterprising and revolutionary character of the Athenians and further looking upon them as of alien extraction began to fear that if they remained they might be tempted by the besieged in Ithome to attempt some political changes

 Meanwhile the rebels in Ithome unable to prolong further a ten years resistance surrendered to Lacedaemon the conditions being that they should depart from Peloponnese under safe conduct and should never set foot in it again any one who might hereafter be found there was to be the slave of his captor

 After this the Peloponnesians marched into Attica as far as Eleusis and Thrius ravaging the country under the conduct of King Pleistoanax the son of Pausanias and without advancing further returned home

 There is however no advantage in reflections on the past further than may be of service to the present

 Further some while before this there was an earthquake at Delos for the first time in the memory of the Hellenes

 Even during the levying of the war he had credit for weakness and Athenian sympathies by the half measures he had advocated and after the army had assembled he had further injured himself in public estimation by his loitering at the Isthmus and the slowness with which the rest of the march had been conducted

 In the whole of one of these you are completely supreme not merely as far as you use it at present but also to what further extent you may think fit in fine your naval resources are such that your vessels may go where they please without the King or any other nation on earth being able to stop them

 First he enclosed the town with a palisade formed of the fruit trees which they cut down to prevent further egress from Plataea next they threw up a mound against the city hoping that the largeness of the force employed would ensure the speedy reduction of the place

 Demosthenes however had in the meanwhile been persuaded by the Messenians that it was a fine opportunity for him having so large an army assembled to attack the Aetolians who were not only the enemies of Naupactus but whose reduction would further make it easy to gain the rest of that part of the continent for the Athenians

 Accordingly they set to work in earnest and having no iron tools picked up stones and put them together as they happened to fit and where mortar was needed carried it on their backs for want of hods stooping down to make it stay on and clasping their hands together behind to prevent it falling off sparing no effort to be able to complete the most vulnerable points before the arrival of the Lacedaemonians most of the place being sufficiently strong by nature without further fortifications

 You can now if you choose employ your present success to advantage so as to keep what you have got and gain honour and reputation besides and you can avoid the mistake of those who meet with an extraordinary piece of good fortune and are led on by hope to grasp continually at something further through having already succeeded without expecting it

 The Athenians however having the men on the island thought that the treaty would be ready for them whenever they chose to make it and grasped at something further

 Nicias seeing the Athenians murmuring against Cleon for not sailing now if it seemed to him so easy and further seeing himself the object of attack told him that for all that the generals cared he might take what force he chose and make the attempt

 The Athenians were already masters of the approaches when Cleon and Demosthenes perceiving that if the enemy gave way a single step further they would be destroyed by their soldiery put a stop to the battle and held their men back wishing to take the Lacedaemonians alive to Athens and hoping that their stubbornness might relax on hearing the offer of terms and that they might surrender and yield to the present overwhelming danger

 Indeed if instead of the customary close oligarchy there had been a constitutional government in Thessaly he would never have been able to proceed since even as it was he was met on his march at the river Enipeus by certain of the opposite party who forbade his further progress and complained of his making the attempt without the consent of the nation

 In this part of the field the Boeotians were beaten and retreated upon the troops still fighting but the right where the Thebans were got the better of the Athenians and shoved them further and further back though gradually at first

 They found the proclamation a fair one in comparison of what their fear had suggested the Athenians being glad to go out as they thought they ran more risk than the rest and further did not expect any speedy relief and the multitude generally being content at being left in possession of their civic rights and at such an unexpected reprieve from danger

 Not only was the town valuable for the timber it afforded for shipbuilding and the money that it brought in but also although the escort of the Thessalians gave the Lacedaemonians a means of reaching the allies of Athens as far as the Strymon yet as long as they were not masters of the bridge but were watched on the side of Eion by the Athenian galleys and on the land side impeded by a large and extensive lake formed by the waters of the river it was impossible for them to go any further

 The great idea of the Lacedaemonians was to get back their men while Brasidas s good fortune lasted further successes might make the struggle a less unequal one in Chalcidice but would leave them still deprived of their men and even in Chalcidice not more than a match for the Athenians and by no means certain of victory

 Further that satisfaction shall be given by you to us and by us to you according to the public law of our several countries all disputes being settled by law without recourse to hostilities

 Posting his youngest soldiers to dash out wherever the enemy should attack them he himself with three hundred picked men in the rear intended to face about during the retreat and beat off the most forward of their assailants Meanwhile before the enemy approached he sought to sustain the courage of his soldiers with the following hasty exhortation Peloponnesians if I did not suspect you of being dismayed at being left alone to sustain the attack of a numerous and barbarian enemy I should just have said a few words to you as usual without further explanation

 These Nicias with one hundred and twenty light armed Methonaeans sixty picked men from the Athenian heavy infantry and all the archers tried to reach by a path running up the hill but received a wound and found himself unable to force the position while Nicostratus with all the rest of the army advancing upon the hill which was naturally difficult by a different approach further off was thrown into utter disorder and the whole Athenian army narrowly escaped being defeated

 He accordingly picked out a hundred and fifty heavy infantry and putting the rest under Clearidas determined to attack suddenly before the Athenians retired thinking that he should not have again such a chance of catching them alone if their reinforcements were once allowed to come up and so calling all his soldiers together in order to encourage them and explain his intention spoke as follows Peloponnesians the character of the country from which we have come one which has always owed its freedom to valour and the fact that you are Dorians and the enemy you are about to fight Ionians whom you are accustomed to beat are things that do not need further comment

 With the beginning of the winter following Ramphias and his companions penetrated as far as Pierium in Thessaly but as the Thessalians opposed their further advance and Brasidas whom they came to reinforce was dead they turned back home thinking that the moment had gone by the Athenians being defeated and gone and themselves not equal to the execution of Brasidas s designs

 Further the Lacedaemonians as time went on became suspected by the Athenians through their not performing some of the provisions in the treaty and though for six years and ten months they abstained from invasion of each other s territory yet abroad an unstable armistice did not prevent either party doing the other the most effectual injury until they were finally obliged to break the treaty made after the ten years war and to have recourse to open hostilities

 The Lacedaemonian envoys returning home some Argive ambassadors who happened to be in Corinth pressed her to conclude the alliance without further delay but were told to attend at the next congress to be held at Corinth

 Upon receiving this message and discovering that the Athenians far from being privy to the Boeotian alliance were involved in a serious quarrel with the Lacedaemonians the Argives paid no further attention to the embassy which they had just sent to Lacedaemon on the subject of the treaty and began to incline rather towards the Athenians reflecting that in the event of war they would thus have on their side a city that was not only an ancient ally of Argos but a sister democracy and very powerful at sea

 At last they put off the Gymnopaediae and marched to their succour but learning at Tegea the defeat of the oligarchs refused to go any further in spite of the entreaties of those who had escaped and returned home and kept the festival

 You have yourselves experienced this with regard to the Lacedaemonians and their allies whom your unexpected success as compared with what you feared at first has made you suddenly despise tempting you further to aspire to the conquest of Sicily

 No one knew who had done it but large public rewards were offered to find the authors and it was further voted that any one who knew of any other act of impiety having been committed should come and give information without fear of consequences whether he were citizen alien or slave

 On the other hand if they were to lighten their vessels and draw together their fast sailers and with these attack us we could either fall upon them when they were wearied with rowing or if we did not choose to do so we could retire to Tarentum while they having crossed with few provisions just to give battle would be hard put to it in desolate places and would either have to remain and be blockaded or to try to sail along the coast abandoning the rest of their armament and being further discouraged by not knowing for certain whether the cities would receive them

 The commons had heard how oppressive the tyranny of Pisistratus and his sons had become before it ended and further that that had been put down at last not by themselves and Harmodius but by the Lacedaemonians and so were always in fear and took everything suspiciously

 This step was justified by the result the Syracusans not coming any further on account of the fire but retreating

 Now Nicias and the Athenians held the opinion that even if the Syracusans should not wish to offer battle it was necessary for them to prevent the building of the cross wall as it already almost overlapped the extreme point of their own and if it went any further it would from that moment make no difference whether they fought ever so many successful actions or never fought at all

 Gylippus led out his heavy infantry further from the fortifications than on the former occasion and so joined battle posting his horse and darters upon the flank of the Athenians in the open space where the works of the two walls terminated

 Decelea is about thirteen or fourteen miles from the city of Athens and the same distance or not much further from Boeotia and the fort was meant to annoy the plain and the richest parts of the country being in sight of Athens

 Accordingly Demosthenes was of opinion that they ought not to stay any longer but agreeably to his original idea in risking the attempt upon Epipolae now that this had failed he gave his vote for going away without further loss of time while the sea might yet be crossed and their late reinforcement might give them the superiority at all events on that element

 Nicias however still objecting a certain diffidence and hesitation came over them with a suspicion that Nicias might have some further information to make him so positive

 The Athenians seeing them closing up the harbour and informed of their further designs called a council of war

 None should therefore relent or think it gain if they go away without further danger to us

 For these reasons the thing appeared impracticable to the magistrates and Hermocrates finding himself unable to do anything further with them had now recourse to the following stratagem of his own

 On the next they started early and got on about two miles further and descended into a place in the plain and there encamped in order to procure some eatables from the houses as the place was inhabited and to carry on with them water from thence as for many furlongs in front in the direction in which they were going it was not plentiful

 Meanwhile occurred some claps of thunder and rain as often happens towards autumn which still further disheartened the Athenians who thought all these things to be omens of their approaching ruin

 But some of the Syracusans who had been in correspondence with him were afraid it was said of his being put to the torture and troubling their success by his revelations others especially the Corinthians of his escaping as he was wealthy by means of bribes and living to do them further mischief and these persuaded the allies and put him to death

 Arrived at Miletus their orders were to aid in generally superintending the good conduct of the war to send off the above ships or a greater or less number to the Hellespont to Pharnabazus if they thought proper appointing Clearchus son of Ramphias who sailed with them to the command and further if they thought proper to make Antisthenes admiral dismissing Astyochus whom the letters of Pedaritus had caused to be regarded with suspicion

 Alcibiades further advised Tissaphernes not to be in too great a hurry to end the war or to let himself be persuaded to bring up the Phoenician fleet which he was equipping or to provide pay for more Hellenes and thus put the power by land and sea into the same hands but to leave each of the contending parties in possession of one element thus enabling the king when he found one troublesome to call in the other

 Upon this the Athenians would yield no further and concluding that there was nothing to be done but that they had been deceived by Alcibiades went away in a passion and proceeded to Samos

 When Pisander and the envoys returned from Tissaphernes to Samos they at once strengthened still further their interest in the army itself and instigated the upper class in Samos to join them in establishing an oligarchy the very form of government which a party of them had lately risen to avoid

 The assassin escaped but his accomplice an Argive was taken and put to the torture by the Four Hundred without their being able to extract from him the name of his employer or anything further than that he knew of many men who used to assemble at the house of the commander of the Peripoli and at other houses

 Further inaction had therefore now become impossible

 Tissaphernes upon hearing of this act of the Peloponnesians in addition to what had occurred at Miletus and Cnidus where his garrisons had been also expelled now saw that the breach between them was serious and fearing further injury from them and being also vexed to think that Pharnabazus should receive them and in less time and at less cost perhaps succeed better against Athens than he had done determined to rejoin them in the Hellespont in order to complain of the events at Antandros and excuse himself as best he could in the matter of the Phoenician fleet and of the other charges against him

 Yet Patrick grieved for Milcho nor that hour Passed further north

 She rose she found that other tomb she knelt And o er it went her wandering palms as though Some stone blind mother o er an infant s face Should spread an agonising hand intent To choose betwixt her own and counterfeit She found that cross deep grav n and further sign Close by to her well known

 Before going further it is desirable to set forth what our aim is and to what extent we are seeking an interpretation of mythology

 Further we shall be able to detect the survival of the savage ideas with least modification and the persistence of the savage myths with least change among the classes of a civilised population which have shared least in the general advance

 The crop lien system which is depopulating the fields of the South is not simply the result of shiftlessness on the part of Negroes but is also the result of cunningly devised laws as to mortgages liens and misdemeanors which can be made by conscienceless men to entrap and snare the unwary until escape is impossible further toil a farce and protest a crime

 Thus it easily happened that more and more the better class of Negroes followed the advice from abroad and the pressure from home and took no further interest in politics leaving to the careless and the venal of their race the exercise of their rights as voters

 The black vote that still remained was not trained and educated but further debauched by open and unblushing bribery or force and fraud until the Negro voter was thoroughly inocu lated with the idea that politics was a method of private gain by disreputable means

 And the condition of the Negro is ever the excuse for further discrimination

 And the thoughts at times puzzled him sorely he could not see just why the circle was not square and carried it out fifty six decimal places one midnight would have gone further indeed had not the matron rapped for lights out

 One might go further and find a fourth step in this development where the songs of white America have been distinctively influenced by the slave songs or have incorporated whole phrases of Negro melody as Swanee River and Old Black Joe

 Still further to realize their expectations and to secure the blessings which a gracious Providence has placed within our reach will in the course of the present important session call for the cool and deliberate exertion of your patriotism firmness and wisdom

 This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit and let me add as it bears an honorable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our citizens

 As well the celerity with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success

 The Secretary of the Treasury has my directions to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information

 Overtures of peace are still continued to the deluded tribes and considerable numbers of individuals belonging to them have lately renounced all further opposition removed from their former situations and placed themselves under the immediate protection of the United States

 It is proper also to inform you that a further loan of florins has been completed in Holland the terms of which are similar to those of the one last announced except as to a small reduction of charges

 The part of the debt of the United States which remains unsubscribed will naturally engage your further deliberations

 An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier to stop the further effusion of blood to arrest the progress of expense to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable purposes in making which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the event or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable or if not attainable to ascertain unequivocally that such is the case

 It is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for florins one at Antwerp at the annual interest of 

 Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivation of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public councils

 It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct improve or enforce this plan of procedure and it will probably be found expedient to extend the legal code and the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States to many cases which though dependent on principles already recognized demand some further provisions

 It is now perceived that every expectation from the tenderness which had been hitherto pursued was unavailing and that further delay could only create an opinion of impotency or irresolution in the Government

 Although the report of the commissioners marks their firmness and abilities and must unite all virtuous men by shewing that the means of conciliation have been exhausted all of those who had committed or abetted the tumults did not subscribe the mild form which was proposed as the atonement and the indications of a peaceable temper were neither sufficiently general nor conclusive to recommend or warrant the further suspension of the march of the militia

 But we have to lament that the fair prospect in this quarter has been once more clouded by wanton murders which some citizens of Georgia are represented to have recently perpetrated on hunting parties of the Creeks which have again subjected that frontier to disquietude and danger which will be productive of further expense and may occasion more effusion of blood

 It is called for by the events which have changed and may be expected still further to change the relative situation of our frontiers

 It will merit inquiry what imperfections in the existing plan further experience may have unfolded

 Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives The statements which will be laid before you relative to the Mint will shew the situation of that institution and the necessity of some further legislative provisions for carrying the business of it more completely into effect and for checking abuses which appear to be arising in particular quarters

 After many delays and disappointments arising out of the European war the final arrangements for fulfilling the engagements made to the Dey and Regency of Algiers will in all present appearance be crowned with success but under great though inevitable disadvantages in the pecuniary transactions occasioned by that war which will render further provision necessary

 Our trade has suffered and is suffering extensive injuries in the West Indies from the cruisers and agents of the French Republic and communications have been received from its minister here which indicate the danger of a further disturbance of our commerce by its authority and which are in other respects far from agreeable

 I will only add that it will afford me a heart felt satisfaction to concur in such further measures as will ascertain to our country the prospect of a speedy extinguishment of the debt

 Further information on this subject will be communicated in the course of the session

 Recent information renders it probably that the Southern Indians either instigated to oppose the demarcation or jealous of the consequences of suffering white people to run a line over lands to which the Indian title had not been extinguished have ere this time stopped the progress of the commissioners and considering the mischiefs which may result from continuing the demarcation in opposition to the will of the Indian tribes the great expense attending it and that the boundaries which the commissioners have actually established probably extend at least as far as the Indian title has been extinguished it will perhaps become expedient and necessary to suspend further proceedings by recalling our commissioner

 The commissioners have not continued the boundary line through any channel of these islands and unless the bay of Passamaquoddy be a part of the Bay of Fundy this further adjustment of boundary will be necessary but it is apprehended that this will not be a matter of any difficulty

 Such defiance was given to the civil authority as rendered hopeless all further attempts by judicial process to enforce the execution of the law and it became necessary to direct a military force to be employed consisting of some companies of regular troops volunteers and militia by whose zeal and activity in cooperation with the judicial power order and submission were restored and many of the offenders arrested

 Unauthorized by the Constitution without the sanction of Congress to go beyond the line of defense the vessel being disabled from committing further hostilities was liberated with its crew

 Their impartial selection also being essential to their value we ought further to consider whether that is sufficiently secured in those States where they are named by a marshal depending on Executive will or designated by the court or by officers dependent on them

 M which are in a course of application to the further discharge of debt and current demands

 In the mean time by payments of the principal of our debt we are liberating annually portions of the external taxes and forming from them a growing fund still further to lessen the necessity of recurring to extraordinary resources

 A further knowledge of the ground in the northeastern and northwestern angles of the United States has evinced that the boundaries established by the treaty of Paris between the British territories and ours in those parts were too imperfectly described to be susceptible of execution

 The form of government thus provided having considered but as temporary and open to such future improvements as further information of the circumstances of our brethren there might suggest it will of course be subject to your consideration

 M of the engagements incurred under the British and French conventions and to advance in the further redemption of the funded debt as rapidly as had been contemplated

 These materials are on hand subject to the further will of the Legislature

 A state of our progress in exploring the principal rivers of that country and of the information respecting them hitherto obtained will be communicated as soon as we shall receive some further relations which we have reason shortly to expect

 As a much larger number will still be wanting to place our sea port towns and waters in that state of defense to which we are competent and they entitled a similar appropriation for a further provision for them is recommended for the ensuing year

 A further appropriation will also be necessary for repairing fortifications already established and the erection of such other works as may have real effect in obstructing the approach of an enemy to our sea port towns or their remaining before them

 Lewis Clarke and Freeman will require further time to be digested and prepared

 I congratulate you fellow citizens on the approach of the period at which you may interpose your authority constitutionally to withdraw the citizens of the United States from all further participation in those violations of human rights which have been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa and which the morality the reputation and the best of our country have long been eager to proscribe

 The result of our negotiations or such incidents in their course as may enable us to infer their probably issue such further movements also on our western frontiers as may shew whether war is to be pressed there while negotiation is protracted elsewhere shall be communicated to you from time to time as they become known to me with whatever other information I possess or may receive which may aid your deliberations on the great national interests committed to your charge

 Still anxious not to close the door against friendly adjustment new modifications were framed and further concessions authorized than could before have been supposed necessary and our ministers were instructed to resume their negotiations on these grounds

 These works will chiefly be finished in the course of the present season except at New York and New Orleans where most was to be done and although a great proportion of the last appropriation has been expended on the former place yet some further views will be submitted to Congress for rendering its security entirely adequate against naval enterprise

 If in permitting British vessels to depart without giving bonds not to proceed to their own ports it should appear that the tenor of legal authority has not been strictly pursued it is to be ascribed to the anxious desire which was felt that no individuals should be injured by so unforeseen an occurrence and I rely on the regard of Congress for the equitable interests of our own citizens to adopt whatever further provisions may be found requisite for a general remission of penalties involuntarily incurred

 It will sow also that forgetting the respect due to all governments he did not refrain from imputations on this which required that no further communications should be received from him

 From a statement which will be made by the Secretary of War it will be seen that the fortifications on our maritime frontier are in many of the ports completed affording the defense which was contemplated and that a further time will be required to render complete the works in the harbor of New York and in some other places

 It was particularly anticipated that as a further evidence of just dispositions toward them restoration would have been immediately made of the property of our citizens under a misapplication of the principle of reprisals combined with a misconstruction of a law of the United States

 This pledge although it does not necessarily import does not exclude the intention of relinquishing along with the others in council the practice of those novel blockades which have a like effect of interrupting our neutral commerce and this further justice to the United States is the rather to be looked for in as much as the blockades in question being not more contrary to the established law of nations than inconsistent with the rules of blockade formally recognized by Great Britain herself could have no alleged basis other than the plea of retaliation alleged as the basis of the orders in council

 The measures pursued in behalf of our injured citizens not having obtained justice for them a further and more formal interposition with the Danish Government is contemplated

 The same just and benevolent motives which produced interdiction in force against this criminal conduct will doubtless be felt by Congress in devising further means of suppressing the evil

 Those for the security of the city of New York though far advanced toward completion will require a further time and appropriation

 These preparations for arming the militia having thus far provided for of the objects contemplated by the power vested in Congress with respect to that great bulwark of the public safety it is for their consideration whether further provisions are not requisite for the other contemplated objects of organization and discipline

 For the probably receipts of the next year and other details I refer to statements which will be transmitted from the Treasury and which will enable you to judge what further provisions may be necessary for the ensuing years

 State of the Union Address James Madison November Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives In calling you together sooner than a separation from your homes would otherwise have been required I yielded to considerations drawn from the posture of our foreign affairs and in fixing the present for the time of your meeting regard was had to the probability of further developments of the policy of the belligerent powers toward this country which might the more unite the national councils in the measures to be pursued

 Under another aspect of our situation the early attention of Congress will be due to the expediency of further guards against evasions and infractions of our commercial laws

 The final communications from our special minister to Denmark afford further proofs of the good effects of his mission and of the amicable disposition of the Danish Government

 There being reason to believe that the act prohibiting the acceptance of British licenses is not a sufficient guard against the use of them for purposes favorable to the interests and views of the enemy further provisions on that subject are highly important

 Further sums to a considerable amount will be necessary to be obtained in the same way during the ensuing year and from the increased capital of the country from the fidelity with which the public engagements have been kept and the public credit maintained it may be expected on good grounds that the necessary pecuniary supplies will not be wanting

 State of the Union Address James Madison September Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives Notwithstanding the early day which had been fixed for your session of the present year I was induced to call you together still sooner as well that any inadequacy in the existing provisions for the wants of the Treasury might be supplied as that no delay might happen in providing for the result of the negotiations on foot with Great Britain whether it should require arrangements adapted to a return of peace or further and more effective provisions for prosecuting the war

 This increased violence is best explained by the two important circumstances that the great contest in Europe for an equilibrium guaranteeing all its States against the ambition of any has been closed without any check on the over bearing power of Great Britain on the ocean and it has left in her hands disposable armaments with which forgetting the difficulties of a remote war with a free people and yielding to the intoxication of success with the example of a great victim to it before her eyes she cherishes hopes of still further aggrandizing a power already formidable in its abuses to the tranquillity of the civilized and commercial world

 Congress will decide on the expediency of promoting such a sequel by giving effect to the measure of confining the American navigation to American sea men a measure which at the same time that it might have that conciliatory tendency would have the further advantage of increasing the independence of our navigation and the resources for our maritime defense

 The residue consisting of the more distant tribes or parts of tribes remain to be brought over by further explanations or by such other means as may be adapted to the dispositions they may finally disclose

 Independent however of the arrearages due for military services and supplies it is presumed that a further sum of M including the interest on the public debt payable on the st of January next will be demanded at the Treasury to complete the expenditures of the present year and for which the existing ways and means will sufficiently provide

 It will be a seasonable occasion also for inquiring how far legislative interposition may be further requisite in providing penalties for offenses designated in the Constitution or in the statutes and to which either no penalties are annexed or none with sufficient certainty

 I submit this subject to the consideration of Congress that such further provision may be made in the sale of the public lands with a view to the public interest should any be deemed expedient as in their judgment may be best adapted to the object

 I submit this subject to the consideration of Congress that such further provision may be made in it as to them may seem proper

 As all the documents relating to this occurrence will be laid before Congress it is not necessary to enter into further detail respecting it

 Under the influence of this relief several branches of this important national interest have assumed greater activity and although it is hoped that others will gradually revive and ultimately triumph over every obstacle yet the expediency of granting further protection is submitted to your consideration

 Our navigation will in like degree be increased and as the shipping of the Atlantic States will be employed in the transportation of the vast produce of the Western country even those parts of the United States which are most remote from each other will be further bound together by the strongest ties which mutual interest can create

 It is further alleged that this Government had recently tolerated or protected an expedition from the United States against the Province of Texas

 In any event the delay for the purpose mentioned being a further manifestation of the sincere desire to terminate in the most friendly manner all differences with Spain can not fail to be duly appreciated by His Catholic Majesty as well as by other powers

 The minister of the United States was instructed to make a further proposal which has not been accepted

 I recommend to the consideration of Congress whether further prohibitory provisions in the laws relating to this intercourse may not be expedient

 The answer of that Government to the proposal when received will indicate the further measures to be pursued on the part of the United States

 For the probably receipts of the next year I refer you to the statements which will be transmitted from the Treasury which will enable you to judge whether further provision be necessary

 In what manner the evils which have been adverted to may be remedied and how far it may be practicable in other respects to afford to them further encouragement paying due regard to the other great interests of the nation is submitted to the wisdom of Congress

 As soon as the treaty by which these Provinces were ceded to the United States was ratified and all danger of further breach of our revenue laws ceased an order was given for the release of the vessel which had been seized and for the dismission of the libel which had been instituted against her

 If this basis is unjust or unreasonable surely it ought to be abandoned but if it be just and reasonable and any change in it will make concessions subversive of equality and tending in its consequences to sap the foundations of our prosperity then the reasons are equally strong for adhering to the ground already taken and supporting it by such further regulations as may appear to be proper should any additional support be found necessary

 Doubts however being entertained as to the propriety of the position and extent of the work at Dauphine Island further progress in it was suspended soon after the last session of Congress and an order given to the Board of Engineers and Naval Commissioners to make a further and more minute examination of it in both respects and to report the result without delay

 With a view to such provision as may be deemed proper the subject is submitted to your consideration and in the interim further proceedings are suspended

 On full consideration of the subject in all its relations I am persuaded that a further augmentation may now be made of the duties on certain foreign articles in favor of our own and without affecting injuriously any other interest

 It was limited in the first instance to two years from but with a proviso that it should further continue in force til the conclusion of a general and definitive treaty of commerce unless terminated by a notice months in advance of either of the parties to the other

 The school of artillery practice established at Fortress Monroe Hampton VA is well suited to the same purpose and may need the aid of further legislative provision to the same end

 At a period of further advancement but with little accession of strength it not only sustained with honor the most unequal of conflicts but covered itself and our country with unfading glory

 They have further stipulated that the parties shall hereafter grant no favor of navigation or commerce to any other nation which shall not upon the same terms be granted to each other and that neither party will impose upon articles of merchandise the produce or manufacture of the other any other or higher duties than upon the like articles being the produce or manufacture of any other country

 With regard to the collection of the revenue of imposts certain occurrences have within the last year been disclosed in one or two of our principal ports which engaged the attention of Congress at their last session and may hereafter require further consideration

 It may be worthy of your serious consideration whether some further legislative provision may not be necessary to come in aid of this state of unguarded security

 The public faith no less than the just rights of individuals and the interest of the community itself appears to require further provision for the speedy settlement of those claims which I therefore recommend to the care and attention of the Legislature

 A hope was for a short time entertained that a treaty of peace actually signed between the Government of Buenos Ayres and of Brazil would supersede all further occasion for those collisions between belligerent pretensions and neutral rights which are so commonly the result of maritime war and which have unfortunately disturbed the harmony of the relations between the United States and the Brazilian Governments

 The number of post offices has been increased to and it may be anticipated that while the facilities of intercourse between fellow citizens in person or by correspondence will soon be carried to the door of every villager in the Union a yearly surplus of revenue will accrue which may be applied as the wisdom of Congress under the exercise of their constitutional powers may devise for the further establishment and improvement of the public roads or by adding still further to the facilities in the transportation of the mails

 I recommend to Congress the revival and continuance for a further term of the beneficent accommodations to the public debtors of that statute and submit to their consideration in the same spirit of equity the remission under proper discriminations of the forfeitures of partial payments on account of purchases of the public lands so far as to allow of their application to other payments

 The same principle has since been much further extended by treaties with France Sweden Denmark the Hanseatic cities Prussia in Europe and with the Republics of Colombia and of Central America in this hemisphere

 The report exhibits in one table the funds appropriated at the last and preceding sessions of Congress for all these fortifications surveys and works of public improvement the manner in which these funds have been applied the amount expended upon the several works under construction and the further sums which may be necessary to complete them in a second the works projected by the Board of Engineers which have not been commenced and the estimate of their cost in a third the report of the annual Board of Visitors at the Military Academy at West Point

 The authority of further legislation is now required for the removal to this tenement of the offenders against the laws sentenced to atone by personal confinement for their crimes and to provide a code for their employment and government while thus confined

 The propriety of further extending the time for the extinguishment of the debt due to the United States by the purchasers of the public lands limited by the act of to will claim the consideration of Congress to whose vigilance and careful attention the regulation disposal and preservation of this great national inheritance has by the people of the United States been intrusted

 Among the important subjects to which the attention of the present Congress has already been invited and which may occupy their further and deliberate discussion will be the provision to be made for taking the th census of enumeration of the inhabitants of the United States

 I deem it my duty further to observe that much of the imperfections in the returns of the last and perhaps of preceding enumerations proceeded from the inadequateness of the compensations allowed to the marshals and their assistants in taking them

 He has also been instructed to make a further appeal to the justice of Spain in behalf of our citizens for indemnity for spoliations upon our commerce committed under her authority an appeal which the pacific and liberal course observed on our part and a due confidence in the honor of that Government authorize us to expect will not be made in vain

 Although these results have fortunately been thus in part attained further facilities to the enjoyment of this new field for the enterprise of our citizens are in my opinion sufficiently desirable to insure to them our most zealous attention

 It might be further extended to the superintendence of all criminal proceedings for offenses against the United States

 There is need however of further legislation to obviate the inconveniences specified in the report under consideration to some of which it is proper that I should call your particular attention

 But we have contended and with reason that if at any time Great Britain may desire the productions of this country as necessary to her colonies they must be received upon principles of just reciprocity and further that it is making an invidious and unfriendly distinction to open her colonial ports to the vessels of other nations and close them against those of the United States

 It is more over within the knowledge of such as are at all conversant with public affairs that schemes of internal improvement have from time to time been proposed which from their extent and seeming magnificence were readily regarded as of national concernment but which upon fuller consideration and further experience would now be rejected with great unanimity

 Toward the aborigines of the country no one can indulge a more friendly feeling than myself or would go further in attempting to reclaim them from their wandering habits and make them a happy prosperous people

 The prosperity of our country is also further evinced by the increased revenue arising from the sale of public lands as will appear from the report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the documents accompanying it which are herewith transmitted

 Of the claims upon England it is unnecessary to speak further than to say that the state of things to which their prosecution and denial gave rise has been succeeded by arrangements productive of mutual good feeling and amicable relations between the two countries which it is hoped will not be interrupted

 I however indulge the hope that further reflection will lead to other views and feel confident that when His Catholic Majesty shall be convinced of the justice of the claims his desire to preserve friendly relations between the two countries which it is my earnest endeavor to maintain will induce him to accede to our demand

 For your further information on this subject I have directed a report to be made by the Secretary of State which I shall hereafter submit to your consideration

 That body having considered the award as not obligatory and advised me to open a further negotiation the proposition was immediately made to the British Government but the circumstances to which I have alluded have hitherto prevented any answer being given to the overture

 Further than this it is neither our policy nor our right to interfere

 Any intervention in their affairs further than this even by the expression of an official opinion is contrary to our principles of international policy and will always be avoided

 The final removal of this great burthen from our resources affords the means of further provision for all the objects of general welfare and public defense which the Constitution authorizes and presents the occasion for such further reductions in the revenue as may not be required for them

 The friendly relations which have always been maintained between the United States and Russia have been further extended and strengthened by the treaty of navigation and commerce concluded on and sanctioned by the Senate before the close of its last session

 But while I forbear to recommend any further reduction of the duties beyond that already provided for by the existing laws I must earnestly and respectfully press upon Congress the importance of abstaining from all appropriations which are not absolutely required for the public interest and authorized by the powers clearly delegated to the United States

 If a contrary course should be pursued it may happen that the revenue of will fall short of the demands upon it and after reducing the tariff in order to lighten the burdens of the people and providing for a still further reduction to take effect hereafter it would be much to be deplored if at the end of another year we should find ourselves obliged to retrace our steps and impose additional taxes to meet unnecessary expenditures

 From the Argentine Republic from which a minister was expected to this Government nothing further has been heard

 The bill was read and referred to a committee but there was no further action upon it

 That the settlement involved a sacrifice in this respect was well known at the time a sacrifice which was cheerfully acquiesced in by the different branches of the Federal Government whose action upon the treaty was required from a sincere desire to avoid further collision upon this old and disturbing subject and in the confident expectation that the general relations between the two countries would be improved thereby

 The idea of acquiescing in the refusal to execute the treaty will not I am confident be for a moment entertained by any branch of this Government and further negotiation upon the subject is equally out of the question

 If it shall be the pleasure of Congress to await the further action of the French Chambers no further consideration of the subject will at this session probably be required at your hands

 Having submitted these considerations it belongs to Congress to decide whether after what has taken place it will still await the further action of the French Chambers or now adopt such provisional measures as it may deem necessary and best adapted to protect the rights and maintain the honor of the country

 In the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury and in his correspondence with the president of the bank and the opinions of the Attorney General accompanying it you will find a further examination of the claims of the bank and the course it has pursued

 It will be seen by the estimates for the present session that a great reduction will take place in the expenditures of the Department in consequence of these laws and there is reason to believe that their operation will be salutary and that the colonization of the Indians on the western frontier together with a judicious system of administration will still further reduce the expenses of this branch of the public service and at the same time promote its usefulness and efficiency

 This measure will if adopted be productive I think of the desired results and I therefore recommend it to your consideration with the further suggestion that all payments should be suspended til the necessary reports are received

 Although from the obviously local character of that work I might well have contented myself with a refusal to approve the bill upon that ground yet sensible of the vital importance of the subject and anxious that my views and opinions in regard to the whole matter should be fully understood by Congress and by my constituents I felt it my duty to go further

 From attempts to appropriate the national funds to objects which are confessedly of a local character we can not I trust have anything further to apprehend

 I will now only add that at the st session of Congress under the new Constitution it was provided by law that all expenses which should accrue from and after the th day of August in the necessary support and maintenance and repairs of all light houses beacons buoys and public piers erected placed or sunk before the passage of the act within any bay inlet harbor or port of the United States for rendering the navigation thereof easy and safe should be defrayed out of the Treasury of the United States and further that it should be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to provide by contracts with the approbation of the President for rebuilding when necessary and keeping in good repair the light houses beacons buoys and public piers in the several States and for furnishing them with supplies

 Further portions of the Florida archives have been sent to the United States although the death of one of the commissioners at a critical moment embarrassed the progress of the delivery of them

 Our patience has been and will probably be still further severely tried but our fellow citizens whose interests are involved may confide in the determination of the Government to obtain for them eventually ample retribution

 To have gone on the other hand a single step further for the purpose of wounding the pride of a Government and people with whom we had so many motives for cultivating relations of amity and reciprocal advantage would have been unwise and improper

 Admonished by the past of the difficulty of making even the simplest statement of our wrongs without disturbing the sensibilities of those who had by their position become responsible for their redress and earnestly desirous of preventing further obstacles from that source I went out of my way to preclude a construction of the message by which the recommendation that was made to Congress might be regarded as a menace to France in not only disavowing such a design but in declaring that her pride and her power were too well known to expect anything from her fears

 Not having received any official information of the intentions of the French Government and anxious to bring as far as practicable this unpleasant affair to a close before the meeting of Congress that you might have the whole subject before you I caused our charge d affaires at Paris to be instructed to ask for the final determination of the French Government and in the event of their refusal to pay the installments now due without further explanations to return to the United States

 France having now through all the branches of her Government acknowledged the validity of our claims and the obligation of the treaty of and there really existing no adequate cause for further delay will at length it may be hoped adopt the course which the interests of both nations not less than the principles of justice so imperiously require

 Let us trust that by the continued observance of economy and by harmonizing the great interests of agriculture manufactures and commerce much more may be accomplished to diminish the burdens of government and to increase still further the enterprise and the patriotic affection of all classes of our citizens and all the members of our happy Confederacy

 As the data which the Secretary of the Treasury will lay before you in regard to our financial resources are full and extended and will afford a safe guide in your future calculations I think it unnecessary to offer any further observations on that subject here

 Aided as it is hoped they will be by further reforms in the banking systems of the States and by judicious regulations on the part of Congress in relation to the custody of the public moneys it may be confidently anticipated that the use of gold and silver as circulating medium will become general in the ordinary transactions connected with the labor of the country

 Argument can scarcely be necessary to show that a measure of this character ought not to receive further legislative encouragement

 These measures will probably be followed up in due time by the enactment of State laws banishing from circulation bank notes of still higher denominations and the object may be materially promoted by further acts of Congress forbidding the employment as fiscal agents of such banks as continue to issue notes of low denominations and throw impediments in the way of the circulation of gold and silver

 It may be thus too in some degree with the further steps which may be taken to prevent the excessive issue of other bank paper but it is to be hoped that nothing will now deter the Federal and State authorities from the firm and vigorous performance of their duties to themselves and to the people in this respect

 It is the high and peculiar duty of Congress to decide whether any further legislation be necessary for the security of the large amount of public property now held and in use by the new bank and for vindicating the rights of the Government and compelling a speedy and honest settlement with all the creditors of the old bank public and private or whether the subject shall be left to the power now possessed by the Executive and judiciary

 In the mean time as you will perceive from the report of the Secretary there is urgent necessity for further appropriations to suppress these hostilities

 The duty of making further provision by law for organizing arming and disciplining this arm of defense has been so repeatedly presented to Congress by myself and my predecessors that I deem it sufficient on this occasion to refer to the last annual message and to former Executive communications in which the subject has been discussed

 A very large amount of the moneys granted at your last session accordingly remains unexpended but as the work will be again resumed at the earliest moment in the coming spring the balance of the existing appropriations and in several cases which will be laid before you with the proper estimates further sums for the like objects may be usefully expended during the next year

 For a general view of the condition of the Military Academy and of other branches of the military service not already noticed as well as for further illustrations of those which have been mentioned I refer you to the accompanying documents and among the various proposals contained therein for legislative action I would particularly notice the suggestion of the Secretary of War for the revision of the pay of the Army as entitled to your favorable regard

 I beg leave to renew the recommendation made in my last annual message respecting the enlistment of boys in our naval service and to urge upon your attention the necessity of further appropriations to increase the number of ships afloat and to enlarge generally the capacity and force of the Navy

 The Department has been redeemed from embarrassment and debt has accumulated a surplus exceeding half a million dollars has largely extended and is preparing still further to extend the mail service and recommends a reduction of postages equal to about 

 It is further respectfully recommended that such being the inconvenience of attention to these duties by the Chief Magistrate and such the great pressure of business on the Treasury Department the general supervision of the coast survey and the completion of the weights and measures if the works are kept united should be devolved on a board of officers organized specially for that purpose or on the Navy Board attached to the Navy Department

 I regret to state that such duties are now exacted in that country upon the cargoes of American vessels and as the act referred to vests no discretion in the Executive it is for Congress to determine upon the expediency of further legislation on the subject

 Not perceiving in what manner any of the powers given to the Executive alone could be further usefully employed in bringing this unfortunate controversy to a satisfactory termination the subject was by my predecessor referred to Congress as one calling for its interposition

 In respect to the last you have had an opportunity since your adjournment not only to test still further the expediency of the measure by the continued practical operation of such parts of it as are now in force but also to discover what should ever be sought for and regarded with the utmost deference the opinions and wishes of the people

 Indeed I am more than ever convinced of the dangers to which the free and unbiased exercise of political opinion the only sure foundation and safeguard of republican government would be exposed by any further increase of the already overgrown influence of corporate authorities

 Entertaining these views I recommend the passage of a preemption law for their benefit in connection with the preparatory steps toward the graduation of the price of the public lands and further and more effectual provisions to prevent intrusions hereafter

 I lay before Congress copies of reports submitted in pursuance of a call made by me upon the heads of Departments for such suggestions as their experience might enable them to make as to what further legislative provisions may be advantageously adopted to secure the faithful application of public moneys to the objects for which they are appropriated to prevent their misapplication or embezzlement by those intrusted with the expenditure of them and generally to increase the security of the Government against losses in their disbursement

 There is at present also reason to believe that an equitable settlement of all disputed points will be attained without further difficulty or unnecessary delay and thus authorize the free resumption of diplomatic intercourse with our sister Republic

 I can not but hope that the good sense and patriotism the regard for the honor and reputation of their country the respect for the laws which they have themselves enacted for their own government and the love of order for which the mass of our people have been so long and so justly distinguished will deter the comparatively few who are engaged in them from a further prosecution of such desperate enterprises

 My conviction of the necessity of further legislative provisions for the safe keeping and disbursement of the public moneys and my opinion in regard to the measures best adapted to the accomplishment of those objects have been already submitted to you

 These have been strengthened by recent events and in the full conviction that time and experience must still further demonstrate their propriety I feel it my duty with respectful deference to the conflicting views of others again to invite your attention to them

 Only a very brief reference to facts in confirmation of this assertion can in this form be given and you are therefore necessarily referred to the report of the Secretary of War for further details

 The object of the application to the circuit court was to compel the Postmaster General to carry into effect an award made by the Solicitor of the Treasury under a special act of Congress for the settlement of certain claims of the relators on the Post Office Department which award the Postmaster General declined to execute in full until he should receive further legislative direction on the subject

 The grave constitutional questions which had been discussed were therefore excluded from the decision of the case the court indeed expressly admitting that with powers and duties properly belonging to the executive no other department can inter fere by the writ of mandamus and the question therefore resolved itself into this Has Congress conferred upon the circuit court of this District the power to issue such a writ to an officer of the General Government commanding him to perform a ministerial act A majority of the court have decided that it has but have rounded their decision upon a process of reasoning which in my judgment renders further legislative provision indispensable to the public interests and the equal administration of justice

 The King of the Netherlands has also in further illustration of his character for justice and of his desire to remove every cause of dissatisfaction made compensation for an American vessel captured in by a French privateer and carried into Curacoa where the proceeds were appropriated to the use of the colony then and for a short time after under the dominion of Holland

 What is still wanting to effect these objects must be sought in additional legislation or if that be inadequate in such further constitutional grants or restrictions as may bring us back into the path from which we have so widely wandered

 The extent to which it may do so by further enactments I have already adverted to and the wisdom of Congress may yet enlarge them

 The result thus far is most honorable to the self denial the intelligence and the patriotism of our citizens it justifies the confident hope that they will carry through the reform which has been so well begun and that they will go still further than they have yet gone in illustrating the important truth that a people as free and enlightened as ours will whenever it becomes necessary show themselves to be indeed capable of self government by voluntarily adopting appropriate remedies for every abuse and submitting to temporary sacrifices however great to insure their permanent welfare

 That minister not feeling himself sufficiently instructed upon some of the points raised in the discussion felt it to be his duty to refer the matter to his own Government for its further decision

 Nor has it been found necessary in order to produce this result to resort to the power conferred by Congress of postponing certain classes of the public works except by deferring expenditures for a short period upon a limited portion of them and which postponement terminated some time since at the moment the Treasury Department by further receipts from the indebted banks became fully assured of its ability to meet them without prejudice to the public service in other respects

 Causes are in operation which will it is believed justify a still further reduction without injury to any important national interest

 General Armistead who was in Florida when General Taylor left the army by permission assumed the command and after active summer operations was met by propositions for peace and from the fortunate coincidence of the arrival in Florida at the same period of a delegation from the Seminoles who are happily settled west of the Mississippi and are now anxious to persuade their countrymen to join them there hopes were for some time entertained that the Indians might be induced to leave the Territory without further difficulty

 The exploring expedition at the latest date was preparing to leave the Bay of Islands New Zealand in further prosecution of objects which have thus far been successfully accomplished

 I regret to say that little further advancement of the object has been accomplished since last year but this is owing to circumstances no way indicative of any abatement of the desire of both parties to hasten the negotiation to its conclusion and to settle the question in dispute as early as possible

 In the course of the session it is my hope to be able to announce some further degree of progress toward the accomplishment of this highly desirable end

 The great truth that government was made for the people and not the people for government has already been established in the practice and by the example of these United States and we can do no other than contemplate its further exemplification by a sister republic with the deepest interest

 The United States have however so uniformly shown a disposition to cultivate relations of amity with that Empire that it is hoped the unequivocal tokens of the same spirit toward us which an adjustment of the affairs referred to would afford will be given without further avoidable delay

 It proceeds a step further and authorizes the purchase and sale of domestic bills and drafts resting on a real and substantial basis payable at sight or having but a short time to run and drawn on places not less than miles apart which authority except in so far as may be necessary for Government purposes exclusively is only to be exerted upon the express condition that its exercise shall not be prohibited by the State in which the agency is situated

 Considering the great increase which has been made in public offices in the last quarter of a century and the probability of further increase we incur the hazard of witnessing violent political contests directed too often to the single object of retaining office by those who are in or obtaining it by those who are out

 I suggest for your consideration the propriety of making without further delay some specific application of the funds derived under the will of Mr

 A further effect of the measure would be to supersede the system of drawbacks thereby effectually protecting the Government against fraud as the right of debenture would not attach to goods after their withdrawal from the public stores

 It would be unprofitable to look further into this anomalous state of things but I can not conclude without adding that for a Government which has paid off its debts of two wars with the largest maritime power of Europe and now owing a debt which is almost next to nothing when compared with its boundless resources a Government the strongest in the world because emanating from the popular will and firmly rooted in the affections of a great and free people and whose fidelity to its engagements has never been questioned for such a Government to have tendered to the capitalists of other countries an opportunity for a small investment in its stock and yet to have failed implies either the most unfounded distrust in its good faith or a purpose to obtain which the course pursued is the most fatal which could have been adopted

 So soon as the title is perfected no further delay will be permitted to intervene

 Treaties of commerce and navigation had been concluded with her by different nations and it had become manifest to the whole world that any further attempt on the part of Mexico to conquer her or overthrow her Government would be vain

 Still further claims amounting to between three and four millions of dollars were submitted to the board too late to be considered and were left undisposed of

 Mexico applied for further indulgence and in that spirit of liberality and forbearance which has ever marked the policy of the United States toward that Republic the request was granted and on the th of January a new treaty was concluded

 As these installments appear never to have been actually paid by the Government of Mexico to the agent and as that Government has not therefore been released so as to discharge the claim I do not feel myself warranted in directing payment to be made to the claimants out of the Treasury without further legislation

 The negotiation of having also failed to effect an adjustment by compromise resulted in the convention of August by which it was agreed to continue in force for an indefinite period the provisions of the third article of the convention of the th of October and it was further provided that It shall be competent however to either of the contracting parties in case either should think fit at any time after the th of October on giving due notice of twelve months to the other contracting party to annul and abrogate this convention and it shall in such case be accordingly entirely annulled and abrogated after the expiration of the said term of notice

 In these attempts to adjust the controversy the parallel of the forty ninth degree of north latitude had been offered by the United States to Great Britain and in those of and with a further concession of the free navigation of the Columbia River south of that latitude

 A proposition was accordingly made which was rejected by the British plenipotentiary who without submitting any other proposition suffered the negotiation on his part to drop expressing his trust that the United States would offer what he saw fit to call some further proposal for the settlement of the Oregon question more consistent with fairness and equity and with the reasonable expectations of the British Government

 Further payments of the public debt would have been made in anticipation of the period of its reimbursement under the authority conferred upon the Secretary of the Treasury by the acts of July and of April and March had not the unsettled state of our relations with Mexico menaced hostile collision with that power

 The efforts of the Government to adjust the difficulties between them have heretofore proved unsuccessful and there remains no probability that this desirable object can be accomplished without the aid of further legislation by Congress

 I invite the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the Postmaster General on this subject under the belief that such a modification of the late law may be made as will yield sufficient revenue without further calls on the Treasury and with very little change in the present rates of postage

 His duties may be still further increased with advantage to the public interests

 But they are willing to try the experiment of another demand made in the most solemn form upon the justice of the Mexican Government before any further proceedings are adopted

 The assurance was further given that the decision of the Mexican Government upon each cause of complaint for which redress had been demanded should be communicated to the Government of the United States by the Mexican minister at Washington

 By making them however Mexico obtained further delay

 President Van Buren believing that it would be vain to make any further attempt to obtain redress by the ordinary means within the power of the Executive communicated this opinion to Congress in the message referred to in which he said On a careful and deliberate examination of their contents of the correspondence with the Mexican Government and considering the spirit manifested by the Mexican Government it has become my painful duty to return the subject as it now stands to Congress to whom it belongs to decide upon the time the mode and the measure of redress

 Practically free and independent acknowledged as a political sovereignty by the principal powers of the world no hostile foot finding rest within her territory for six or seven years and Mexico herself refraining for all that period from any further attempt to reestablish her own authority over that territory it can not but be surprising to find Mr

 In the Provinces of New Mexico and of the Californias little if any further resistance is apprehended from the inhabitants to the temporary governments which have thus from the necessity of the case and according to the laws of war been established

 In order to prosecute the war with Mexico with vigor and energy as the best means of bringing it to a speedy and honorable termination a further loan will be necessary to meet the expenditures for the present and the next fiscal year

 On the happening of such contingency and on receiving notice thereof the general in command was instructed by the Secretary of War to suspend further active military operations until further orders

 It is further manifest that Congress contemplated territorial indemnity from the fact that at their last session an act was passed upon the Executive recommendation appropriating with that express object

 The Mexican Government will be informed of his recall and that in the existing state of things I shall not deem it proper to make any further overtures of peace but shall be at all times ready to receive and consider any proposals which may be made by Mexico

 What further provision may become necessary and what final disposition it may be proper to make of them must depend on the future progress of the war and the course which Mexico may think proper hereafter to pursue

 To meet the expenditures for the remainder of the present and for the next fiscal year ending on the th of June a further loan in aid of the ordinary revenues of the Government will be necessary

 The loan may be further reduced by whatever amount of expenditures can be saved by military contributions collected in Mexico

 Should the war with Mexico be continued until the th of June it is estimated that a further loan of will be required for the fiscal year ending on that day in case no duty be imposed on tea and coffee and the public lands be not reduced and graduated in price and no military contributions shall be collected in Mexico

 If the duty on tea and coffee be imposed and the lands be reduced and graduated in price as proposed the loan may be reduced to and will be subject to be still further reduced by the amount of the military contributions which may be collected in Mexico

 The Secretary of the Treasury upon whom was devolved large discretionary powers in carrying this measure into effect has collected and is now collating the practical results of the system in other countries where it has long been established and will report at an early period of your session such further regulations suggested by the investigation as may render it still more effective and beneficial

 As further contracts for the transportation of the mail to foreign countries may be authorized by Congress this number may be enlarged indefinitely

 It is gratifying to find that within so short a period after the reduction in the rates of postage and notwithstanding the great increase of mail service the revenue received for the year will be sufficient to defray all the expenses and that no further aid will be required from the Treasury for that purpose

 If the appropriations made by Congress shall not exceed the amount estimated the means in the Treasury will be sufficient to defray all the expenses of the Government to pay off the next installment of to Mexico which will fall due on the th of May next and still a considerable surplus will remain which should be applied to the further purchase of the public stock and reduction of the debt

 The further sum of 

 After the proclamation of peace no further disbursements were made of any unexpended moneys arising from this source

 These considerations have satisfied the Postmaster General that with certain modifications of the act of the revenue may be still further increased and a reduction of postages made to a uniform rate of cents without an interference with the principle which has been constantly and properly enforced of making that Department sustain itself

 Apprehensive that this act of intervention on our part might be viewed as a violation of our neutral obligations incurred by the treaty with Denmark and of the provisions of the act of Congress of the th of April I directed that no further aid should be rendered by any agent or officer of the Navy and I instructed the Secretary of State to apprise the minister of the German Empire accredited to this Government of my determination to execute the law of the United States and to maintain the faith of treaties with all nations

 During the recent revolutions in the Papal States our charge d affaires at Rome has been unable to present his letter of credence which indeed he was directed by my predecessor to withhold until he should receive further orders

 Such was the unsettled condition of things in those States that it was not deemed expedient to give him any instructions on the subject of presenting his credential letter different from those with which he had been furnished by the late Administration until the th of June last when in consequence of the want of accurate information of the exact state of things at that distance from us he was instructed to exercise his own discretion in presenting himself to the then existing Government if in his judgment sufficiently stable or if not to await further events

 The expenses incident to the organization of the commission and to its conveyance to the point where its operations were to begin have so much reduced the fund appropriated by Congress that a further sum to cover the charges which must be incurred during the present fiscal year will be necessary

 For further details and views on the above and other matters connected with commerce the finances and revenue I refer to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury

 Still further legal provisions will be necessary for the effective and successful extension of our system of Indian intercourse over the new territories

 For further views on these and other matters connected with the duties of the home department I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior

 It is submitted to the wisdom of Congress whether a further reduction of postage should not now be made more particularly on the letter correspondence

 Whether any further diminution should now be made or the result of the reduction to cents which I have recommended should be first tested is submitted to your decision

 My opinions will be frankly expressed upon the leading subjects of legislation and if which I do not anticipate any act should pass the two Houses of Congress which should appear to me unconstitutional or an encroachment on the just powers of other departments or with provisions hastily adopted and likely to produce consequences injurious and unforeseen I should not shrink from the duty of returning it to you with my reasons for your further consideration

 It will consequently be my endeavor to cause any further negotiations on the part of this Government which may be requisite for this purpose to be so conducted as to bring them to a speedy and successful close

 Some unavoidable delay has occurred arising from distance and the difficulty of intercourse between this Government and that of Nicaragua but as intelligence has just been received of the appointment of an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of that Government to reside at Washington whose arrival may soon be expected it is hoped that no further impediments will be experienced in the prompt transaction of business between the two Governments

 Further consideration it is to be hoped or some modification of terms may yet reconcile the differences existing between the two Governments in this respect

 The appropriation already made will it is believed be sufficient to defray the whole expense of the work but further legislation may be necessary in regard to the compensation of some of the marshals of the Territories

 I was at first inclined to favor the system of leasing as it seemed to promise the largest revenue to the Government and to afford the best security against monopolies but further reflection and our experience in leasing the lead mines and selling lands upon credit have brought my mind to the conclusion that there would be great difficulty in collecting the rents and that the relation of debtor and creditor between the citizens and the Government would be attended with many mischievous consequences

 For further suggestions on this subject and others connected with our domestic interests and the defense of our frontier I refer you to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Secretary of War

 The last is supposed to be the preferable mode and will if not entirely so nearly supply that deficiency as to make any further appropriation that may be found necessary so inconsiderable as to form no obstacle to the proposed reductions

 For this reason I recommend your adherence to the adjustment established by those measures until time and experience shall demonstrate the necessity of further legislation to guard against evasion or abuse

 You will consider whether further legislation be necessary to prevent the perpetration of such offenses in future

 John to the Pacific has been so far accomplished as that passengers have actually traversed it and merchandise has been transported over it and when the canal shall have been completed according to the original plan the means of communication will be further improved

 which however includes the sum of paid under the twelfth article of the treaty with Mexico and the further sum of 

 The value of our exports of breadstuffs and provisions which it was supposed the incentive of a low tariff and large importations from abroad would have greatly augmented has fallen from in to in and to in with a strong probability amounting almost to a certainty of a still further reduction in the current year

 In the same section of the law it is further provided That no more than five millions of said stock shall be issued until the creditors of the State holding bonds and other certificates of stock of Texas for which duties on imports were specially pledged shall first file at the Treasury of the United States releases of all claims against the United States for or on account of said bonds or certificates in such form as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury and approved by the President of the United States

 It will be seen that the cash sales of the public lands exceed those of the preceding year and that there is reason to anticipate a still further increase notwithstanding the large donations which have been made to many of the States and the liberal grants to individuals as a reward for military services

 But further legislation and additional appropriations will be necessary before the proper subdivisions can be made and the general land system extended over those remote parts of our territory

 In my last annual message I recommended the survey and sale of them in small parcels under such restrictions as would effectually guard against monopoly and speculation but upon further information and in deference to the opinions of persons familiar with the subject I am inclined to change that recommendation and to advise that they be permitted to remain as at present a common field open to the enterprise and industry of all our citizens until further experience shall have developed the best policy to be ultimately adopted in regard to them

 Some difficulties have occurred in organizing the Territorial governments of New Mexico and Utah and when more accurate information shall be obtained of the causes a further communication will be made on that subject

 The surplus of the revenues now on hand is however so large that no further appropriation from the Treasury in aid of the revenues of the Department is required for the current fiscal year but an additional appropriation for the year ending June will probably be found necessary when the receipts of the first two quarters of the fiscal year are fully ascertained

 He now recommends adherence to the present letter rates and advises against a further reduction until justified by the revenue of the Department

 In my last annual message I stated that I considered the series of measures which had been adopted at the previous session in reference to the agitation growing out of the Territorial and slavery questions as a final settlement in principle and substance of the dangerous and exciting subjects which they embraced and I recommended adherence to the adjustment established by those measures until time and experience should demonstrate the necessity of further legislation to guard against evasion or abuse

 This subject however has already engaged the attention of the Senate of the United States and requires no further comment in this communication

 It has not proved equally acceptable to Nicaragua but it is to be hoped that the further negotiations on the subject which are in train will be carried on in that spirit of conciliation and compromise which ought always to prevail on such occasions and that they will lead to a satisfactory result

 Since that time on further investigation of the subject the doubts which had been entertained of the title of Peru to those islands have been removed and I have deemed it just that the temporary wrong which had been unintentionally done her from want of information should be repaired by an unreserved acknowledgment of her sovereignty

 Since this latter period further purchases of the principal of the public debt have been made to the extent of 

 My attention was drawn to this subject by a report from the Department of the Interior which reviewed all the facts of the case and submitted for my decision the question whether under existing circumstances any part of the appropriation could be lawfully used or expended for the further prosecution of the work

 Orders were immediately issued by him to the commissioner and surveyor to make no further requisitions on the Department as they could not be paid and to discontinue all operations on the southern line of New Mexico

 It will also be proper to make further provision by law for the fulfillment of our treaty with Mexico for running and marking the residue of the boundary line between the two countries

 Further appropriations will also be necessary for grading and paving the streets and avenues and inclosing and embellishing the public grounds within the city of Washington

 In former messages I have among other things respectfully recommended to the consideration of Congress the propriety and necessity of further legislation for the protection and punishment of foreign consuls residing in the United States to revive with certain modifications the act of th March to restrain unlawful military expeditions against the inhabitants of conterminous states or territories for the preservation and protection from mutilation or theft of the papers records and archives of the nation for authorizing the surplus revenue to be applied to the payment of the public debt in advance of the time when it will become due for the establishment of land offices for the sale of the public lands in California and the Territory of Oregon for the construction of a road from the Mississippi Valley to the Pacific Ocean for the establishment of a bureau of agriculture for the promotion of that interest perhaps the most important in the country for the prevention of frauds upon the Government in applications for pensions and bounty lands for the establishment of a uniform fee bill prescribing a specific compensation for every service required of clerks district attorneys and marshals for authorizing an additional regiment of mounted men for the defense of our frontiers against the Indians and for fulfilling our treaty stipulations with Mexico to defend her citizens against the Indians with equal diligence and energy as our own for determining the relative rank between the naval and civil officers in our public ships and between the officers of the Army and Navy in the various grades of each for reorganizing the naval establishment by fixing the number of officers in each grade and providing for a retired list upon reduced pay of those unfit for active duty for prescribing and regulating punishments in the Navy for the appointment of a commission to revise the public statutes of the United States by arranging them in order supplying deficiencies correcting incongruities simplifying their language and reporting them to Congress for its final action and for the establishment of a commission to adjudicate and settle private claims against the United States

 These difficulties which have been encountered in a period of peace would be magnified and still further increased in time of war

 The commission which that treaty contemplated for determining the rights of fishery in rivers and mouths of rivers on the coasts of the United States and the British North American Provinces has been organized and has commenced its labors to complete which there are needed further appropriations for the service of another season

 The report of the Secretary of the Navy herewith submitted exhibits in full the naval operations of the past year together with the present condition of the service and it makes suggestions of further legislation to which your attention is invited

 To whatever extent these questions exhibit a tendency menacing to the stability of the Constitution or the integrity of the Union and no further they demand the consideration of the Executive and require to be presented by him to Congress

 It stood on the statute book however for a number of years and the people of the respective States acquiesced in the reenactment of the principle as applied to the State of Texas and it was proposed to acquiesce in its further application to the territory acquired by the United States from Mexico

 Legislation has been recommended by me on previous occasions to cure defects in the existing organization and to increase the efficiency of the Army and further observation has but served to confirm me in the views then expressed and to enforce on my mind the conviction that such measures are not only proper but necessary

 The suggestions of the Secretary of the Navy in regard to further improvement in that branch of the service I commend to your favorable action

 I concur in the views expressed by the Secretary of the Department in favor of a still further increase of our naval force

 Diplomatic representatives from two contending parties have been recently sent to this Government but with the imperfect information possessed it was not possible to decide which was the Government de facto and awaiting further developments I have refused to receive either

 The law providing for this tax was by its terms to take effect on the st of September last but the local authorities on the Isthmus have been induced to suspend its execution and to await further instructions on the subject from the Government of the Republic

 Recent incidents tend to show that the local authorities can not be relied on to maintain the public peace of Panama and there is just ground for apprehension that a portion of the inhabitants are meditating further outrages without adequate measures for the security and protection of persons or property having been taken either by the State of Panama or by the General Government of New Granada

 At the same time I assured those who should persist in rebellion against the United States that they must expect no further lenity but look to be rigorously dealt with according to their deserts

 It was impossible for me to proceed further than this on my own authority without usurping the war making power which under the Constitution belongs exclusively to Congress

 At the commencement of your last session I had reason to hope that emancipating themselves from further unavailing discussions the two Governments would proceed to settle the Central American questions in a practical manner alike honorable and satisfactory to both and this hope I have not yet abandoned

 Not content with this the Government proceeded still further and issued a decree banishing him from the country

 When this fails it can proceed no further

 But this subject was treated so much at large in my last annual message that I shall not now pursue it further

 I invite Congress to institute a rigid scrutiny to ascertain whether the expenses in all the Departments can not be still further reduced and I promise them all the aid in my power in pursuing the investigation

 In communicating this interpretation of the act to Congress he stated that some doubt had been entertained as to its true intent and meaning and he submitted the question to them so that they might should it be deemed advisable amend the same before further proceedings are had under it

 Those who announce abstract doctrines subversive of the Constitution and the Union must not be surprised should their heated partisans advance one step further and attempt by violence to carry these doctrines into practical effect

 On the contrary I firmly believe that the events at Harpers Ferry by causing the people to pause and reflect upon the possible peril to their cherished institutions will be the means under Providence of allaying the existing excitement and preventing further outbreaks of a similar character

 Should they fail to do this hereafter it will then be time enough to strengthen their hands by further legislation

 Whilst I do not deem it proper on the present occasion to go further into the subject and discuss the weight which ought to be attached to the statements of the British colonial authorities contesting the accuracy of the information on which the gallant General acted it was due to him that I should thus present his own reasons for issuing the order to Captain Pickett

 But this balance as well as that estimated to remain in the Treasury on the st July will be reduced by such appropriations as shall be made by law to carry into effect certain Indian treaties during the present fiscal year asked for by the Secretary of the Interior to the amount of and upon the estimates of the postmaster General for the service of his Department the last fiscal year ending th June amounting to together with the further estimate of that officer for the service of the present fiscal year ending th June being making an aggregate of 

 In order still further to secure the uninterrupted exercise of these high powers against State interposition it is provided that This Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof and all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding

 The bare enumeration of these provisions proves how inadequate they are without further legislation to overcome a united opposition in a single State not to speak of other States who may place themselves in a similar attitude

 The framers of the existing tariff have gone further and in a liberal spirit have discriminated in favor of large and useful branches of our manufactures not by raising the rate of duty upon the importation of similar articles from abroad but what is the same in effect by admitting articles free of duty which enter into the composition of their fabrics

 I further suggest that general provision be made for chaplains to serve at hospitals as well as with regiments

 I submit therefore for your consideration what further mark of recognition is due to him and to ourselves as a grateful people

 And further it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer is fixed in that condition for life

 I ask the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the Postmaster General in his report respecting the further legislation required in his opinion for the benefit of the postal service

 This it would seem must further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual slavery and especially of those who are to receive the compensation

 In my judgment they have aided and will further aid the cause for which they were intended

 The objections to a premature presentation of a plan by the National Executive consist in the danger of committals on points which could be more safely left to further developments

 If Congress should think that proceedings in such cases lack the authority of law or ought to be further regulated by it I recommend that provision be made for effectually preventing foreign slave traders from acquiring domicile and facilities for their criminal occupation in our country

 I concur with him in the opinion that the proportion of moneys required to meet the expenses consequent upon the war derived from taxation should be still further increased and I earnestly invite your attention to this subject to the end that there may be such additional legislation as shall be required to meet the just expectations of the Secretary

 Whether or not any further legislation is advisable for the suppression of State bank issues it will be for Congress to determine

 And as it is to so go at all events may we not agree that the sooner the better It is not claimed that the election has imposed a duty on members to change their views or their votes any further than as an additional element to be considered their judgment may be affected by it

 The volunteer force has already been reduced by the discharge from service of over troops and the Department is proceeding rapidly in the work of further reduction

 Every reduction will diminish the total amount of interest to be paid and so enlarge the means of still further reductions until the whole shall be liquidated and this as will be seen from the estimates of the Secretary of the Treasury may be accomplished by annual payments even within a period not exceeding thirty years

 Those convictions are not only unchanged but strengthened by subsequent events and further reflection The transcendent importance of the subject will be a sufficient excuse for calling your attention to some of the reasons which have so strongly influenced my own judgment

 Congress however intervened and refusing to perfect the work so nearly consummated declined to admit members from the unrepresented States adopted a series of measures which arrested the progress of restoration frustrated all that had been so successfully accomplished and after three years of agitation and strife has left the country further from the attainment of union and fraternal feeling than at the inception of the Congressional plan of reconstruction

 These statistics further show that in the annual national expenses compared with the population were little more than per capita and in but per capita while in they will reach the extravagant sum of 

 It is estimated by the Secretary that the returns for the past month will add to our liabilities the further sum of making a total increase during thirteen months of 

 We should follow the wise precedents established in and and without further delay make provision for the payment of our obligations at as early a period as may be practicable

 A system that produces such results is justly regarded as favoring a few at the expense of the many and has led to the further inquiry whether our bondholders in view of the large profits which they have enjoyed would themselves be averse to a settlement of our indebtedness upon a plan which would yield them a fair remuneration and at the same time be just to the taxpayers of the nation

 Believing that a further step could be taken in the same direction I last year entered into a treaty with the King of Denmark for the purchase of the islands of St

 I am aware that upon the question of further extending our possessions it is apprehended by some that our political system can not successfully be applied to an area more extended than our continent but the conviction is rapidly gaining ground in the American mind that with the increased facilities for intercommunication between all portions of the earth the principles of free government as embraced in our Constitution if faithfully maintained and carried out would prove of sufficient strength and breadth to comprehend within their sphere and influence the civilized nations of the world

 With the funding of the national debt as here suggested I feel safe in saying that taxes and the revenue from imports may be reduced safely from sixty to eighty millions per annum at once and may be still further reduced from year to year as the resources of the country are developed

 No further steps having been taken by the representative of the Peruvian Government to prevent the departure of these vessels and I not feeling authorized to detain the property of a nation with which we are at peace on a mere Executive order the matter has been referred to the courts to decide

 The large outlay which is thus occasioned is further increased by the more liberal allowance bestowed since that date upon those who in the line of duty were wholly or permanently disabled

 Should the present struggle result in attaching the hearts of the French to our simpler forms of representative government it will be a subject of still further satisfaction to our people

 It is to be hoped that this moderate demand may be acceded to by Spain without further delay

 Anticipating that an attempt may possibly be made by the Canadian authorities in the coming season to repeat their unneighborly acts toward our fishermen I recommend you to confer upon the Executive the power to suspend by proclamation the operation of the laws authorizing the transit of goods wares and merchandise in bond across the territory of the United States to Canada and further should such an extreme measure become necessary to suspend the operation of any laws whereby the vessels of the Dominion of Canada are permitted to enter the waters of the United States

 I would further recommend that the payment of naval pensions be transferred to one of the bureaus of the Navy Department

 To give importance to and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic relations with Japan and China and to further aid in retaining the good opinion of those peoples and to secure to the United States its share of the commerce destined to flow between those nations and the balance of the commercial world I earnestly recommend that an appropriation be made to support at least four American youths in each of those countries to serve as a part of the official family of our ministers there

 In this connection I renew my recommendation of one year ago that To give importance to and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic relations with Japan and China and to further aid in retaining the good opinion of those peoples and to secure to the United States its share of the commerce destined to flow between those nations and the balance of the commercial world an appropriation be made to support at least four American youths in each of those countries to serve as a part of the official family of our ministers there

 As there is reason to believe however that its hesitancy in recognizing them springs in part at least from real difficulty in discharging them in connection with its obligations to other governments the expediency of further forbearance on our part is believed to be worthy of your consideration

 The result satisfies me that further legislation has become necessary

 I would further suggest for your consideration the propriety of authorizing national banks to diminish their standing issue at pleasure by returning for cancellation their own bills and withdrawing so many United States bonds as are pledged for the bills returned

 In any modification of the present laws regulating national banks as a further step toward preparing for resumption of specie payments I invite your attention to a consideration of the propriety of exacting from them the retention as a part of their reserve either the whole or a part of the gold interest accruing upon the bonds pledged as security for their issue

 I submit the subject to you therefore without further comment

 To further this object I suggest that a small appropriation be made accompanied with authority for the Secretary of the Navy to fit out a naval vessel to ascend the Amazon River to the mouth of the Madeira thence to explore that river and its tributaries into Bolivia and to report to Congress at its next session or as soon as practicable the accessibility of the country by water its resources and the population so reached

 Having on previous occasions submitted to the consideration of Congress the propriety of the release of the Japanese Government from the further payment of the indemnity under the convention of October and as no action had been taken thereon it became my duty to regard the obligations of the convention as in force and as the other powers interested had received their portion of the indemnity in full the minister of the United States in Japan has in behalf of this Government received the remainder of the amount due to the United States under the convention of Simonosaki

 Negotiations are pending looking to the securing of the results of the decisions which have been reached and to a further extension of the commission for a limited time which it is confidently hoped will suffice to bring all the business now before it to a final close

 Further surveys of the great Isthmus have been undertaken and completed and two vessels of the Navy are now employed in conjunction with those of England France Germany and Russia in observations connected with the transit of Venus so useful and interesting to the scientific world

 The use of the Navy in time of peace might be further utilized by a direct authorization of the employment of naval vessels in explorations and surveys of the supposed navigable waters of other nationalities on this continent especially the tributaries of the two great rivers of South America the Orinoco and the Amazon

 The theory is even raised that there is to be no further interference on the part of the General Government to protect citizens within a State where the State authorities fail to give protection

 Persuaded however that a proper regard for the interests of the United States and of its citizens entitles it to relief from the strain to which it has been subjected by the difficulties of the questions and the wrongs and losses which arise from the contest in Cuba and that the interests of humanity itself demand the cessation of the strife before the whole island shall be laid waste and larger sacrifices of life be made I shall feel it my duty should my hopes of a satisfactory adjustment and of the early restoration of peace and the removal of future causes of complaint be unhappily disappointed to make a further communication to Congress at some period not far remote and during the present session recommending what may then seem to me to be necessary

 I am happy to announce that the Government of Venezuela has upon further consideration practically abandoned its objection to pay to the United States that share of its revenue which some years since it allotted toward the extinguishment of the claims of foreigners generally

 Since my last annual message the exchange has been made of the ratification of a treaty of commerce and navigation with Belgium and of conventions with the Mexican Republic for the further extension of the joint commission respecting claims with the Hawaiian Islands for commercial reciprocity and with the Ottoman Empire for extradition all of which have been duly proclaimed

 It may then be necessary to make some further recommendation in regard to legislation for the government of that Territory

 It has been productive of evident improvement in the condition of that race and will be continued with only such modifications as further experience may indicate to be necessary

 It is confidently believed that the balance of trade in favor of the United States will increase not diminish and that the pledge of Congress to resume specie payments in will be easily accomplished even in the absence of much desired further legislation on the subject

 The money necessary for these repairs should be provided at once that they may be completed without further unnecessary delay and expense

 It is not probable that public affairs will ever again receive attention from me further than as a citizen of the Republic always taking a deep interest in the honor integrity and prosperity of the whole land

 It is my purpose to transmit to Congress as early as practicable a report by the chairman of the Commission and to ask your attention to such measures on this subject as in my opinion will further promote the improvement of the civil service

 Our relations with the Republics of Central and South America and with the Empire of Brazil have continued without serious change further than the temporary interruption of diplomatic intercourse with Venezuela and with Guatemala

 Without desiring to anticipate that report I venture to express the hope that in the decision of so important a question the views expressed above may not be lost sight of and that the decision whatever it may be will arrest further agitation of this subject such agitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon the service as well as on the Indians themselves

 Adequate accommodations for the great library which is overgrowing the capacity of the rooms now occupied at the Capitol should be provided without further delay

 To secure this important reduction of interest to be paid by the United States further legislation is required which it is hoped will be provided by Congress during its present session

 The great revival of trade internal and foreign will supply during the coming year its own instructions which may well be awaited before attempting further experimental measures with the coinage

 A further and more radical change was obviously required

 In the meantime however competitive examinations under many embarrassments have been conducted within limited spheres in the Executive Departments in Washington and in a number of the custom houses and post offices of the principal cities of the country with a view to further test their effects and in every instance they have been found to be as salutary as they are stated to have been under the Administration of my predecessor

 The United States have not deemed it proper to interpose in the matter further than to convey to all the Governments concerned the assurance that the friendly offices of the Government of the United States for the restoration of peace upon an honorable basis will be extended in case the belligerents shall exhibit a readiness to accept them

 Payments have been made in accordance with the statute as the work progressed amounting in the aggregate to and further payments will become due as provided by the statute in the event of success in maintaining the channel now secured

 It is expected that the settlement of this difficulty will lead to such arrangements as will prevent further hostile contact between the Indians and the border settlements in western Colorado

 In my last annual message I expressed the hope that the decision of that question then in prospect would arrest further agitation of this subject such agitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon the service as well as on the Indians themselves

 For the reasons here stated and in view of the fact that further uncertainty on this point will be calculated to obstruct other much needed legislation to weaken the discipline of the service and to unsettle salutary measures now in progress for the government and improvement of the Indians I respectfully recommend that the decision arrived at by Congress at its last session be permitted to stand

 Measures in accordance with this traditional policy for the further benefit of all these interests and the extension of the same advantages to every portion of the country it is hoped will receive your favorable consideration

 Upon both these topics the disposition toward a friendly agreement is manifested by a recognition of our right to an indemnity for the transaction at Fortune Bay leaving the measure of such indemnity to further conference and by an assent to the view of this Government presented in the previous correspondence that the regulation of conflicting interests of the shore fishery of the provincial seacoasts and the vessel fishery of our fishermen should be made the subject of conference and concurrent arrangement between the two Governments

 An early peace between these Republics is much to be desired not only that they may themselves be spared further misery and bloodshed but because their continued antagonism threatens consequences which are in my judgment dangerous to the interests of republican government on this continent and calculated to destroy the best elements of our free and peaceful civilization

 An international conference to consider the means of arresting the spread of cholera and other epidemic diseases was held at Rome in May last and adjourned to meet again on further notice

 In view of the fact referred to by the Secretary of War that the work of this service ordinarily is of a scientific nature and the further fact that it is assuming larger proportions constantly and becoming more and more unsuited to the fixed rules which must govern the Army I am inclined to agree with him in the opinion that it should be separately established

 In the case of the Dolphin with entire justice to the contractor an agreement has been entered into providing for the ascertainment by a judicial inquiry of the complete or partial compliance with the contract in her construction and further providing for the assessment of any damages to which the Government may be entitled on account of a partial failure to perform such contract or the payment of the sum still remaining unpaid upon her price in case a full performance is adjudged

 The conviction is forced upon us with the certainty of mathematical demonstration that before we proceed further in the restoration of a Navy we need a thoroughly reorganized Navy Department

 The fact that within seventeen years more than have been spent in the construction repair equipment and armament of vessels and the further fact that instead of an effective and creditable fleet we have only the discontent and apprehension of a nation undefended by war vessels added to the disclosures now made do not permit us to doubt that every attempt to revive our Navy has thus far for the most part been misdirected and all our efforts in that direction have been little better than blind gropings and expensive aimless follies

 Experience has commended it to those who enjoy its benefits and further enlargement of its facilities is due to other communities to which it is adapted

 Its main features are The transfer of all the original jurisdiction of the circuit courts to the district courts and an increase of judges for the latter where necessary an addition of judges to the circuit courts and constituting them exclusively courts of appeal and reasonably limiting appeals thereto further restrictions of the right to remove causes from the State to Federal courts permitting appeals to the Supreme Court from the courts of the District of Columbia and the Territories only in the same cases as they are allowed from State courts and guarding against an unnecessary number of appeals from the circuit courts

 They further report that while there can not be found upon the registration lists of voters the name of a man actually guilty of polygamy and while none of that class are holding office yet at the last election in the Territory all the officers elected except in one county were men who though not actually living in the practice of polygamy subscribe to the doctrine of polygamous marriages as a divine revelation and a law unto all higher and more binding upon the conscience than any human law local or national

 The standing instructions of our representatives at Madrid and Havana have for years been to leave no effort unessayed to further these ends and at no time has the equal good desire of Spain been more hopefully manifested than now

 This regard and attention should be awarded them not only because labor is the capital of our workingmen justly entitled to its share of Government favor but for the further and not less important reason that the laboring man surrounded by his family in his humble home as a consumer is vitally interested in all that cheapens the cost of living and enables him to bring within his domestic circle additional comforts and advantages

 They however have been since November or will at once be further reduced by being bonds which have been called as already stated but not redeemed and canceled before the latter date

 I have seen no reason to change the views expressed in my last annual message on the subject of this compulsory coinage and I again urge its suspension on all the grounds contained in my former recommendation reenforced by the significant increase of our gold exportations during the last year as appears by the comparative statement herewith presented and for the further reasons that the more this currency is distributed among the people the greater becomes our duty to protect it from disaster that we now have abundance for all our needs and that there seems but little propriety in building vaults to store such currency when the only pretense for its coinage is the necessity of its use by the people as a circulating medium

 When manufactured into cloth and other goods and material for use its cost is not only increased to the extent of the farmer s tariff profit but a further sum has been added for the benefit of the manufacturer under the operation of other tariff laws

 When he faces the tradesman for that purpose he discovers that he is obliged not only to return in the way of increased prices his tariff profit on the wool he sold and which then perhaps lies before him in manufactured form but that he must add a considerable sum thereto to meet a further increase in cost caused by a tariff duty on the manufacture

 The seventh President of the United States the soldier and statesman and at all times the firm and brave friend of the people in vindication of his course as the protector of popular rights and the champion of true American citizenship declared The ambition which leads me on is an anxious desire and a fixed determination to restore to the people unimpaired the sacred trust they have confided to my charge to heal the wounds of the Constitution and to preserve it from further violation to persuade my countrymen so far as I may that it is not in a splendid government supported by powerful monopolies and aristocratical establishments that they will find happiness or their liberties protection but in a plain system void of pomp protecting all and granting favors to none dispensing its blessings like the dews of heaven unseen and unfelt save in the freshness and beauty they contribute to produce

 Having first fulfilled the just demands of international comity by affording full opportunity for Her Majesty s Government to act in relief of the situation I considered prolongation of discussion to be unwarranted and thereupon declined to further recognize the diplomatic character of the person whose continuance in such function would destroy that mutual confidence which is essential to the good understanding of the two Governments and was inconsistent with the welfare and self respect of the Government of the United States

 Similar claims of our citizens will continue to be urged upon the Chilean Government and it is hoped will not be subject to further delays

 Our minister has been further instructed to extend on the part of this Government a formal and cordial recognition of the new Republic so soon as the majority of the people of Brazil shall have signified their assent to its establishment and maintenance

 No further use should be made of this method of getting the surplus into circulation and the deposits now outstanding should be gradually withdrawn and applied to the purchase of bonds

 He was further directed to use his influence to promote good order and to avoid any conflicts between or with the settlers

 Believing that the introduction and sale of liquors where no legal restraints or regulations existed would endanger the public peace and in view of the fact that such liquors must first be introduced into the Indian reservations before reaching the white settlements I further directed the general commanding to enforce the laws relating to the introduction of ardent spirits into the Indian country

 The importance of the Mexican railway system will be further enhanced to a degree almost impossible to forecast if it should become a link in the projected intercontinental railway

 I hope the depression in the price of silver is temporary and that a further trial of this legislation will more favorably affect it

 Such an event would be at once fatal to the further progress of the silver movement

 Its home influence has been very great in disseminating agricultural and horticultural information in stimulating and directing a further diversification of crops in detecting and eradicating diseases of domestic animals and more than all in the close and informal contact which it has established and maintains with the farmers and stock raisers of the whole country

 If a system of customs duties can be framed that will set the idle wheels and looms of Europe in motion and crowd our warehouses with foreign made goods and at the same time keep our own mills busy that will give us an increased participation in the markets of the world of greater value than the home market we surrender that will give increased work to foreign workmen upon products to be consumed by our people without diminishing the amount of work to be done here that will enable the American manufacturer to pay to his workmen from to per cent more in wages than is paid in the foreign mill and yet to compete in our market and in foreign markets with the foreign producer that will further reduce the cost of articles of wear and food without reducing the wages of those who produce them that can be celebrated after its effects have been realized as its expectation has been in European as well as in American cities the authors and promoters of it will be entitled to the highest praise

 The subject of the power of the Treasury to deal with this matter without further legislation has been under consideration but circumstances have postponed a conclusion

 A further and conclusive evidence of the mutual respect and confidence now existing is furnished by the fact that a convention submitting to arbitration the mutual claims of the citizens of the respective Governments has been agreed upon

 This sum will be further augmented especially if the title of the Indians to the tract now Greet County Tex

 The Commissioner of Pensions believes that if the present legislation and methods are maintained and further additions to the pension laws are not made the maximum expenditure for pensions will be reached June and will be at the highest point per annum

 But if the gold reserve falls below how will it be replenished except by selling more bonds Is there any other way practicable under existing law The serious question then is Shall we continue the policy that has been pursued in the past that is when the gold reserve reaches the point of danger issue more bonds and supply the needed gold or shall we provide other means to prevent these recurring drains upon the gold reserve If no further legislation is had and the policy of selling bonds is to be continued then Congress should give the Secretary of the Treasury authority to sell bonds at long or short periods bearing a less rate of interest than is now authorized by law

 But of this aspect of the Spanish note it is not necessary to speak further now

 Turning to the practical aspects of a recognition of belligerency and reviewing its inconveniences and positive dangers still further pertinent considerations appear

 If not the exigency of further and other action by the United States will remain to be taken

 This Government has not been invited to mediate and on the other hand has sought no intervention in that matter further than to evince its kindliest disposition toward such a speedy and direct adjustment by the two sovereign States in interest as shall comport with equity and honor

 Our special envoys have not made their final report as further negotiations between the representatives of this Government and the Governments of other countries are pending and in contemplation

 They believe that doubts which have been raised in certain quarters respecting the position of maintaining the stability of the parity between the metals and kindred questions may yet be solved by further negotiations

 However should these reports of the suffering of our fellow citizens be further verified every effort at any cost should be made to carry them relief

 In further effort to prevent the invasion of the United States by yellow fever the importance of the discovery of the exact cause of the disease which up to the present time has been undetermined is obvious and to this end a systematic bacteriological investigation should be made

 It was felt by the continental powers which on April through their ambassadors and envoys addressed to the Executive an expression of hope that humanity and moderation might mark the course of this Government and people and that further negotiations would lead to an agreement which while securing the maintenance of peace would afford all necessary guaranties for the reestablishment of order in Cuba

 In further fulfillment of international duty I issued April a proclamation announcing the treatment proposed to be accorded to vessels and their cargoes as to blockade contraband the exercise of the right of search and the immunity of neutral flags and neutral goods under enemy s flag

 Explorers have been sent to many of the countries of the Eastern and Western hemispheres for seeds and plants that may be useful to the United States and with the further view of opening up markets for our surplus products

 If the insufficiencies of existing laws can be remedied by further legislation it should be done

 A further extension of its term for one year until December was effected by a convention signed December z and exchanged and proclaimed in February last

 The purely international character of the work being done by the bureau and the appreciation of its value are further emphasized by the active co operation which the various Governments of the Latin

 The United States from the earliest days of foreign intercourse with China had followed a policy of peace omitting no occasions to testify good will to further the extension of lawful trade to respect the sovereignty of its Government and to insure by all legitimate and kindly but earnest means the fullest measure of protection for the lives and property of our law abiding citizens and for the exercise of their beneficent callings among the Chinese people

 We rely upon the reciprocal justice and good will of that Government to assure to us a further improvement in our commercial relations

 It will be the duty as I am sure it will be the disposition of the Congress to provide whatever further legislation is needed to insure the continued parity under all conditions between our two forms of metallic money silver and gold

 This sum together with the amount which may accrue from further redemptions under the call will be applied to the sinking fund

 It will however be the duty of the Commission to inquire diligently as to whether there are any further changes which ought not to be delayed and if so they are authorized to make such changes subject to your approval

 There is no room for further reduction here

 The attention of the Congress is called to the report of the Secretary of the Interior touching the necessity for the further establishment of schools in the Territory of Alaska and favorable action is invited thereon

 What further remedies are needed in the way of governmental regulation or taxation can only be determined after publicity has been obtained by process of law and in the course of administration

 This shows conclusively the want which the establishment of the service has met and the need of further extending it as rapidly as possible

 It is to be hoped that the Congress will make liberal appropriations for the continuance of the service already established and for its further extension

 Should the revenue from customs suffer much further decrease during the fiscal year the surplus would vanish

 I deem it important that the commission be continued and that a sum of money be appropriated sufficient to pay the expenses of its further labors

 Further steps should be taken

 Yet the Congress should ever keep in mind that a peculiar obligation rests upon us to further in every way the welfare of these communities

 Further legislation is not recommended until the necessities of change are more apparent

 The dispatch further calls on us to restore order and secure Colombian supremacy in the Isthmus from which the Colombian Government has just by its action decided to bar us by preventing the construction of the canal

 I now renew that recommendation and further recommend that the Congress appoint a commission to make a comprehensive study of employer s liability with the view of extending the provisions of a great and constitutional law to all employments within the scope of Federal power

 Not only are the laws relating to naturalization now defective but those relating to citizenship of the United States ought also to be made the subject of scientific inquiry with a view to probable further legislation

 Furthermore at the request of the Interparliamentary Union an eminent body composed of practical statesmen from all countries I have asked the Powers to join with this Government in a second Hague conference at which it is hoped that the work already so happily begun at The Hague may be carried some steps further toward completion

 In such case they will do themselves no good and will stop for the time being all further effort to advance them and give them a greater share in their own government

 But in my judgment the necessity for giving this further power is by no means as great as the necessity for giving the commission or administrative body the other powers I have enumerated above and it may well be inadvisable to attempt to vest this particular power in the commission or other administrative body until it already possesses and is exercising what I regard as by far the most important of all the powers I recommend as indeed the vitally important power that to fix a given maximum rate which rate after the lapse of a reasonable time goes into full effect subject to review by the courts

 I renewed that recommendation in my message to the Fifty eighth Congress at its second session and further suggested the appointment of a commission to make a comprehensive study of employers liability with a view to the enactment of a wise and Constitutional law covering the subject applicable to all industries within the scope of the Federal power

 It is obvious that if the compilation of statistics be the limit of the Federal power it is wholly ineffective to regulate this form of commercial intercourse between the States and as the insurance business has outgrown in magnitude the possibility of adequate State supervision the Congress should carefully consider whether further legislation can be bad

 The United States Government in response expressed its cordial acquiescence and stated that it would as a matter of course take part in the new conference and endeavor to further its aims

 Very much can be done through another Hague conference in this direction and I most earnestly urge that this Nation do all in its power to try to further the movement and to make the result of the decisions of The Hague conference effective

 To perfect them by further amendment seems impracticable

 There is no justification for further delay and the advisability of making the four Territories into two States has been clearly established

 The importance of enacting into law the particular bill in question is further increased by the fact that the Government has now definitely begun a policy of resorting to the criminal law in those trust and interstate commerce cases where such a course offers a reasonable chance of success

 Now however largely thru the instrumentality of the Bureau of Labor it is being rigidly enforced and I shall speedily be able to say whether or not there is need of further legislation in reference thereto 

 In the short session it will perhaps be difficult to do much further along this line and it may be best to wait until the laws have been in operation for a number of months before endeavoring to increase their scope because only operation will show with exactness their merits and their shortcomings and thus give opportunity to define what further remedial legislation is needed

 Such a movement as the grange movement is good in itself and is capable of a well nigh infinite further extension for good so long as it is kept to its own legitimate business

 Nothing would more promote iniquity nothing would further defer the reign upon earth of peace and righteousness than for the free and enlightened peoples which tho with much stumbling and many shortcomings nevertheless strive toward justice deliberately to render themselves powerless while leaving every despotism and barbarism armed and able to work their wicked will

 In the event that the court should affirm the constitutionality of the act I urge further legislation along the lines advocated in my Message to the preceding Congress

 It must continue in the future to deal with growing crops as it has dealt in the past but it must still further extend its field of usefulness hereafter by dealing with live men through a far reaching study and treatment of the problems of farm life alike from the industrial and economic and social standpoint

 Fully to prevent the fraud in the public lands which through the joint action of the Interior Department and the Department of Justice we have been endeavoring to prevent there must be further legislation and especially a sufficient appropriation to permit the Department of the Interior to examine certain classes of entries on the ground before they pass into private ownership

 I further commend to the Congress the consideration of the Postmaster General s recommendation for an extension of the parcel post especially on the rural routes

 I further recommend that a naval monument be established in the Vicksburg National Park

 Although the agreements reached in the Conference did not in any direction go to the length hoped for by the more sanguine yet in many directions important steps were taken and upon every subject on the programme there was such full and considerate discussion as to justify the belief that substantial progress has been made toward further agreements in the future

 It is further agreed that arbitration here contemplated shall be in conformity as to procedure with Chapter III of the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes adopted at The Hague and that it shall determine in so far as there shall be no agreement between the parties the justice and the amount of the debt the time and mode of payment thereof

 A further agreement of the first importance was that for the creation of an international prize court

 The commission reported and upon the basis of the report a further temporary commercial agreement was entered into by the two countries pursuant to which in the exercise of the authority conferred upon the President by the third section of the tariff act of July I extended the reduced tariff rates provided for in that section to champagne and all other sparkling wines and pursuant to which the German conventional or minimum tariff rates were extended to about per cent of all the exports from the United States to Germany

 The Congress should without further delay pass a model employers liability law for the District of Columbia

 But we can prevent further mischief being done and it would be in the highest degree reprehensible to let any consideration of temporary convenience or temporary cost interfere with such action especially as regards the National Forests which the nation can now at this very moment control

 Meyer of the Bureau of Plant Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture has incidentally furnished in very striking fashion proof of the ruin that comes from reckless deforestation of mountains and of the further fact that the damage once done may prove practically irreparable

 There are certain mountains in China from which the soil is gone so utterly that only the slow action of the ages could again restore it although of course much could be done to prevent the still further eastward extension of the Mongolian Desert if the Chinese Government would act at once

 These needs should be met without further dilly dallying or delay

 The Congress should provide for superintendents with adequate corps of first class civilian scouts or rangers and further place the road construction under the superintendent instead of leaving it with the War Department

 The law of June and its amendment of March accomplished what was desired in that respect and the use of denatured alcohol as intended is making a fair degree of progress and is entitled to further encouragement and support from the Congress

 It prevents the promotion of employees in the Secret Service and this further discourages good effort

 The Department of State in view of proofs filed with it in showing the American possession occupation and working of certain coal bearing lands in Spitzbergen accepted the invitation under the reservation above stated and under the further reservation that all interests in those islands already vested should be protected and that there should be equality of opportunity for the future

 It was further pointed out that membership in the Conference on the part of the United States was qualified by the consideration that this Government would not become a signatory to any conventional arrangement concluded by the European members of the Conference which would imply contributory participation by the United States in any obligation or responsibility for the enforcement of any scheme of administration which might be devised by the Conference for the islands

 Constitutional government seems also to have made further advance in Persia

 The fact that it is about to enter a new building erected through the munificence of an American philanthropist and the contributions of all the American nations where both its efficiency of administration and expense of maintenance will naturally be much augmented further entitles it to special consideration

 There is now a personnel law for the Navy which itself needs amendment and to which I shall make further reference

 In several Departments there is presented the necessity for legislation looking to the further conservation of our national resources and the subject is one of such importance as to require a more detailed and extended discussion than can be entered upon in this communication

 I further recommend that such preliminary commission serve without salary except as to their actual expenses and that an appropriation be made to meet such expenses

 The increase in population and the more expensive mode of living of the people which have not been accompanied by a proportionate increase in acreage production may furnish a further reason

 This policy has recently found further exemplification in the assistance given by this Government to the negotiations between China and a group of American bankers for a loan of to be employed chiefly in currency reform

 The year has further been marked by two important international agreements relating to Far Eastern affairs

 This exchange of friendly visits has had the happy effect of even further strengthening our friendly international relations

 Further a convention for the arbitration of pecuniary claims was signed and a number of important resolutions passed

 It justifies further efforts for the readjustment of the commercial relations of the two countries so that their commerce may follow the channels natural to contiguous countries and be commensurate with the steady expansion of trade and industry on both sides of the boundary line

 The volume of business obtained in new fields of competition and upon new lines is already very great and Congress is urged to continue to support the Department of State in its endeavors for further trade expansion

 The marked improvement in the consular service during the four years since the principles of the Civil Service Act were applied to that service in a limited way and the good results already noticeable from a similar application of civil service principles to the diplomatic service a year ago convince me that the enactment into law of the general principles of the existing executive regulations could not fail to effect further improvement of both branches of the foreign service offering as it would by its assurance of permanency of tenure and promotion on merit an inducement for the entry of capable young men into the service and an incentive to those already in to put forth their best efforts to attain and maintain that degree of efficiency which the interests of our international relations and commerce demand

 In May last the Supreme Court handed down decisions in the suits in equity brought by the United States to enjoin the further maintenance of the Standard Oil Trust and of the American Tobacco Trust and to secure their dissolution

 The decisions do not depart in any substantial way from the previous decisions of the court in construing and applying this important statute but they clarify those decisions by further defining the already admitted exceptions to the literal construction of the act

 It in effect commanded the dissolution of this combination directed the transfer and pro rata distribution by the New Jersey company of the stock held by it in the thirty seven corporations to and among its stockholders and the corporations and individual defendants were enjoined from conspiring or combining to restore such monopoly and all agreements between the subsidiary corporations tending to produce or bring about further violations of the act were enjoined

 All covenants restricting competition have been declared null and further performance of them has been enjoined

 The settlement of this controversy has happily eliminated from the relations between the Republic of Chile and the United States the only question which for two decades had given the two foreign offices any serious concern and makes possible the unobstructed development of the relations of friendship which it has been the aim of this Government in every possible way to further and cultivate

 In further illustration of the practical and beneficent application of the principle of arbitration and the underlying broad spirit of conciliation I am happy to advert to the part of the United States in facilitating amicable settlement of disputes which menaced the peace between Panama and Costa Rica and between Haiti and the Dominican Republic

 The United States sent in honor of this event a special embassy to Caracas where the cordial reception and generous hospitality shown it were most gratifying as a further proof of the good relations and friendship existing between that country and the United States

 I am glad to say that no further invasion of American rights of any substantial character occurred

 The courteous and cordial welcome extended to this Government s representatives by His Majesty and the people of Great Britain has further emphasized the strong bonds of friendship happily existing between the two nations

 I expect that immediately after the Christmas recess I shall be able to make a further communication to Congress on this subject

 It is my earnest conviction that the enactment into law of the general principles of the existing regulations can not fail to effect further improvement in both branches of the foreign service by providing greater inducement for young men of character and ability to seek a career abroad in the service of the Government and an incentive to those already in the service to put forth greater efforts to attain the high standards which the successful conduct of our international relations and commerce requires

 I further stated that I believed these investigations would be of great value as a basis for accurate legislation and that I should from time to time recommend to Congress the revision of certain schedules in accordance with the findings of the Board

 It would be a mistake further to retard this already slow promotion by throwing back into the line of the Arm a number of high ranking officers to be absorbed as is rovided in the Another feature of the bill which I believe to be a mistake is the proposed increase in the term of enlistment from three to five ears I believe it would be better to enlist men for six years release them at the end of three years from active service and put them in reserve for the remaining three years

 The question whether the use of American ports as foci of revolutionary intrigue can be best dealt with by a further amendment to the neutrality statutes or whether it would be safer to deal with special cases by special laws is one worthy of the careful consideration of the Congress

 From the beginning of the upheaval last autumn it was felt by the United States in common with the other powers having large interests in China that independent action by the foreign Governments in their own individual interests would add further confusion to a situation already complicated

 It was further mutually agreed in the hope of hastening an end to hostilities that none of the interested powers would approve the making of loans by its nationals to either side

 Mindful of its treaty relations and owing to the position of the Government of the United States as mediator between the Dominican Republic and Haiti in their boundary dispute and because of the further fact that the revolutionary activities on the Haitian Dominican frontier had become so active as practically to obliterate the line of demarcation that had been heretofore recognized pending the definitive settlement of the boundary in controversy it was found necessary to indicate to the two island Governments a provisional de facto boundary line

 This little force must be still further drawn upon to supply the new garrisons for the great naval base which is being established at Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands and to protect the locks now rapidly approaching completion at Panama

 Our citizen soldiers under present conditions have reached a stage of development beyond which they can not reasonably be asked to go without further direct assistance in the form of pay from the Federal Government

 It does not permit the Federal Government as a condition of its permit to require that a part of the value thus created shall be applied to the further general improvement and protection of the stream

 If the water power thus created can be made available for the further improvement of navigation in the stream it is manifest that the improvement will be much more quickly effected on the one hand and on the other that the burden on the general taxpayers of the country will be very much reduced

 Nothing could be further from the truth

 I think it will be easily agreed that we should let the Sherman anti trust law stand unaltered as it is with its debatable ground about it but that we should as much as possible reduce the area of that debatable ground by further and more explicit legislation and should also supplement that great act by legislation which will not only clarify it but also facilitate its administration and make it fairer to all concerned

 We can satisfy the obligations of generous justice toward the people of Porto Rico by giving them the ample and familiar rights and privileges accorded our own citizens in our own territories and our obligations toward the people of Hawaii by perfecting the provisions for self government already granted them but in the Philippines we must go further

 It seems to me that it might be the part of wisdom therefore before further legislation in this field is attempted to look at the whole problem of coordination and efficiency in the full light of a fresh assessment of circumstance and opinion as a guide to dealing with the several parts of it

 Immediate passage of the bill to regulate the expenditure of money in elections may seem to be less necessary than the immediate enactment of the other measures to which I refer because at least two years will elapse before another election in which Federal offices are to be filled but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dangers to the public morals of the present method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under recent observation and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied in the light of present experience and a delay would have the further very serious disadvantage of postponing action until another election was at hand and some special object connected with it might be thought to be in the mind of those who urged it

 Recent experience has convinced me that the Congress must go further in authorizing the Government to set limits to prices

 Europe is in no position at the present time to ship gold to us nor could we contemplate large further imports of gold into this country without concern

 I would urge also the continuance of Federal participation in the building of good roads under the terms of existing law and under the direction of present agencies the need of further action on the part of the States and the Federal Government to preserve and develop our forest resources especially through the practice of better forestry methods on private holdings and the extension of the publicly owned forests better support for country schools and the more definite direction of their courses of study along lines related to rural problems and fuller provision for sanitation in rural districts and the building up of needed hospital and medical facilities in these localities

 Over has already been paid to the railroads under this act during the present fiscal year and it is estimated that further payments aggregating possibly must still be made to the railroads during the current year

 In response to what I believe to be the impulse of sympathy and opinion throughout the United States I earnestly suggest that the Congress authorize the Treasury of the United States to make to the struggling government of Armenia such a loan as was made to several of the Allied governments during the war and I would also suggest that it would be desirable to provide in the legislation itself that the expenditure of the money thus loaned should be under the supervision of a commission or at least a commissioner from the United States in order that revolutionary tendencies within Armenia itself might not be afforded by the loan a further tempting opportunity

 The repeal of war tinie legislation and the automatic expirations which attended the peace proclamations have put an end to these emergency excesses but I have the wish to go further than that

 By your sustainment of the rigid economies already inaugurated with hoped for extension of these economies and added efficiencies in administration I believe further reductions may be enacted and hindering burdens abolished

 I especially commend a decrease on earned incomes and further abolition of admission message and nuisance taxes

 Their decision should be awaited before attempting further legislation on this subject

 If our Alaskan fisheries are to be saved from destruction there must be further legislation declaring a general policy and delegating the authority to make rules and regulations to an administrative body

 Further reductions should not be made

 Perhaps the most important work that this session of the Congress can do is to continue a policy of economy and further reduce the cost of government in order that we may have a reduction of taxes for the next fiscal year

 There are pending before the Congress bills for further development of the Mississippi Basin for the taking over of the Cape Cod Canal in accordance with a moral obligation which seems to have been incurred during the war and for the improvement of harbors on both the Pacific and the Atlantic coasts

 RAILWAYS The railways during the past year have made still further progress in recuperation from the war with large rains in efficiency and ability expeditiously to handle the traffic of the country

 In my message last year I emphasized the necessity for further legislation with a view to expediting the consolidation of our rail ways into larger systems

 If these elements are not comprehended in proposed legislation it would be better to gain further experience with the present organization for dealing with these questions before undertaking a change

 I further recommend that provision be made for the appointment of a commission to consist of two or three members of the Federal judiciary and as many members of the bar to examine the present criminal code of procedure and recommend to the Congress measures which may reform and expedite court procedure in the administration and enforcement of our criminal laws

 Further provision should also be made for a like reason for a separate reformatory for women

 I believe it would be for the advantage of this country and helpful to the stability of other nations for us to adhere to the protocol establishing that court upon the conditions stated in the recommendation which is now before the Senate and further that our country shall not be bound by advisory opinions which may be rendered by the court upon questions which we have not voluntarily submitted for its judgment

 DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE Many times I have expressed my desire to see the work of the Washington Conference on Limitation of Armaments appropriately supplemented by further agreements for a further reduction M for the purpose of diminishing the menace and waste of the competition in preparing instruments of international war

 It has been and is my expectation that we might hopefully approach other great powers for further conference on this subject as soon as the carrying out of the present reparation plan as the established and settled policy of Europe has created a favorable opportunity

 The country does not appear to require radical departures from the policies already adopted so much as it needs a further extension of these policies and the improvement of details

 There is room for further economy in the cost of the Federal Government but a co n of current expenditures with pre war expenditures is not able to the efficiency with which Government business is now being done

 This does not mean that further economies will not come

 In so far as income tax exemptions are concerned it seems to me the committee has gone as far as it is Safe to go and somewhat further than I should have gone

 Any further extension along these lines would in my opinion impair tile integrity of our income tax system

 The natural corollary to these treaties should be further international contracts for the limitation of armaments

 If that can be settled we may more easily consider further reduction and limitation of naval armaments

 In the further pursuit of strengthening the bonds of peace and good will we have joined with other nations in an international conference held at Geneva and signed an agreement which will be laid before the Senate for ratification providing suitable measures for control and for publicity in international trade in arms ammunition

 Since the adjournment further agreements have been entered into with Belgium Czechoslovakia Latvia Estonia Italy and Rumania

 At the suggestion of the Secretaries of War and Navy I appointed a special board to make a further study of the problem of aircraft

 The organizations of ex service men have proposed additional legislative changes which you will consider but until the new law and the modifications made at the last session of Congress are given a more thorough test further changes in the basic law should be few and made only after careful though sympathetic consideration

 The principal work now before the Veterans Bureau is the perfection of its organization and further improvements in service

 every provision should be made for the relief of the disabled and the necessary care of dependents the Congress may well consider whether the financial condition of the Government is not such that further bounty through the enlargement of general pensions and other emoluments ought not to be postponed

 That ought to suggest a method of relief which will make unnecessary further appeals to the Congress

 It will be carried on together with the further opening up of our harbors as our resources permit

 We should have this information before creating further obligations for retirement annuities which will become liabilities to be met in the future from the money of the taxpayer

 Many projects are being broached requiring further large outlays

 There is agreement on all sides that some portions of our agricultural industry have lagged behind other industries in recovery from the war and that further improvement in methods of marketing of agricultural products is most desirable

 There is belief also that the Federal Government can further contribute to these ends beyond the many helpful measures taken during the last five years through the different acts of Congress for advancing the interests of the farmers

 In determination of what further measures may be undertaken it seems to me there are certain pitfalls which must be avoided and our test in avoiding them should be to avoid disaster to the farmer himself

 It has assumed a menace that is of national magnitude and warrants the Federal Government in extending its cooperation to the State and local agencies which are attempting to prevent its further spread and secure its eradication

 RADIO LEGISLATION The Department of Commerce has for some years urgently presented the necessity for further legislation in order to protect radio listeners from interference between broadcasting stations and to carry out other regulatory functions

 Due to decisions of the courts the authority of the department under the law of has broken down many more stations have been operating than can be accommodated within the limited number of wave lengths available further stations are in course of construction many stations have departed from the scheme of allocation set down by the department and the whole service of this most important public function has drifted into such chaos as seems likely if not remedied to destroy its great value

 I do not believe it is desirable to set tip further independent agencies in the Government

 While I approve of proper relief for all suffering I do not favor any further extension of our pension system at this time

 One of the most encouraging features of the commission s work thus far has been the agreement in principle among the naval experts of a majority of the powers parties to the Washington treaty limiting naval armament upon methods and standards for the comparison and further limitation of naval armament

 It is needless to say that at the proper time I shall be prepared to proceed along practical lines to the conclusion of agreements carrying further the work begun at the Washington Conference in 

 Exemptions have been increased until people make but individual taxable returns so that further reduction should be mainly for the purpose of removing inequalities

 Until it has progressed further the efficiency of the government and the happiness of the people may need the guiding hand of an appointed governor

 Such a request is very nearly the equivalent of a declaration that their navigation is not profitable that the commodities which they are to carry can be taken at a cheaper rate by some other method in which case the hundreds of millions of dollars proposed to be expended for opening rivers to navigation would be not only wasted but would entail further constant expenditures to carry the commodities of private persons for less than cost

 The needs along health educational industrial and social lines however are great and the Budget estimates for include still further increases for Indian administration

 The magnitude of the undertaking is already so large that all requests calling for further expenditure should have the most searching scrutiny

 Some further legislation to provide for reuniting families when either the husband or the wife is in this country and granting more freedom for the migration of the North American Indian tribes is desirable

 It will be necessary to purchase further land and provide the required continuing appropriations

 There is no surplus on which to base further tax revision at this time

 Further amendments to the existing law will be suggested by the American Legion the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States the Disabled American Veterans of the World War and other like organizations and it may be necessary for administrative purposes or in order to remove some existing inequalities in the present law to make further changes

 This means not only further progress in overcoming the price disparity into which agriculture was plunged in but also increased efficiency on the part of farmers and a well grounded confidence in the future of agriculture

 The present status of agriculture although greatly improved over that of a few years ago bespeaks the need of further improvemen which calls for determined effort of farmers themselves encouraged and assisted by wise public policy

 AIR MAIL SERVICE The friendly relations and the extensive commercial intercourse with the Western Hemisphere to the south of us are being further cemented by the establishment and extension of air mail routes

 Until we can see our way out of this expense no further river and harbor legislation should be passed as expenditures to put it into effect would be four or five years away

 Appropriate estimates are being submitted in the Budget for the further prosecution of this important work

 In the hope of reducing friction in the world and with the desire that we may reduce the great economic burdens of naval armament we have joined in conference with Great Britain France Italy and Japan to be held in London in January to consider the further limitation and reduction of naval arms

 Opportunity of further peaceful development is given to that country

 The two governments have taken further steps to promote friendly relationships and so solve our differences

 A further instance of profound importance in establishing good will was the inauguration of regular air mail service between the United States and Caribbean Central American and South American countries

 We have already reduced these forces materially and we are anxious to withdraw them further as the situation warrants

 Our forces in China constitute men which we hope also further to reduce to the normal legation guard

 In order however that we may further develop the most effective force in this one of the most responsible functions of our Government I shall recommend to the Congress more liberal appropriations for the work of the State Department

 If we shall be compelled to undertake the naval construction implied in the Washington arms treaty as well as other construction which would appear to be necessary if no international agreement can be completed we shall be committed during the next six years to a construction expenditure of upward of besides the necessary further increase in costs for annual upkeep

 Since June it has been reduced by a further 

 Conflict of opinion which has arisen over the proposed floodway from the Arkansas River to the Gulf of Mexico via the Atchafalaya River has led me to withhold construction upon this portion of the Mississippi flood control plan until it could be again reviewed by the engineers for any further recommendation to Congress

 In the meantime I recommend that the Congress should consider the desirability of authorizing further expansion of the South American services

 Construction loans have been made to the amount of approximately out of the revolving fund authorized by Congress and have furnished an additional aid to American shipping and further stimulated the building of vessels in American yards

 In particular it seemed to me necessary to determine if the result of the contracts already let would assure the purpose expressed in the act to further develop an American merchant marine to assure its permanence in the transportation of the foreign trade of the United States and for other purposes and to develop a coordinated policy by which these purposes may be translated into actualities

 Federal officials can however make a further and most important contribution by leadership in stimulation of the community and voluntary agencies and by extending Federal assistance in organization of these forces and bringing about cooperation among them

 I recommend that the Congress should give the subject further study in which the executive departments will gladly cooperate with the hope of discovering such method as will more fully secure our national necessities

 Further improvement in administration may require some amendment from time to time to the law but care should be taken to see that such changes conform to the basic principles of the legislation

 I recommend that a further step be taken by authorization that appointments of third class postmasters be made under the civil service law

 Further recommendations upon the subject as a whole will be developed after further examination by the Law Enforcement Commission but it is not to be expected that any criminal law will ever be fully enforced so long as criminals exist

 Pending further legislation the Department of Justice has been striving to weed out inefficiency wherever it exists to stimulate activity on the part of its prosecuting officers and to use increasing care in examining into the qualifications of those appointed to serve as prosecutors

 I favor still further temporary expansion of these activities in aid to unemployment during this winter

 I have canvassed the departments of the Government as to the maximum amount that can be properly added to our present expenditure to accelerate all construction during the next six months and I feel warranted in asking the Congress for an appropriation of from to to provide such further employment in this emergency

 While it will be necessary in public interest to further increase expenditures during the current fiscal year in aid to unemployment by speeding up construction work and aid to the farmers affected by the drought I can not emphasize too strongly the absolute necessity to defer any other plans for increase of Government expenditures

 Further legislation is necessary to facilitate such consolidation

 To prevent the occasion for further uneconomic leasing I recommend that the Congress authorize the building by the Government of its own facilities

 SOCIAL SERVICE I urge further consideration by the Congress of the recommendations I made a year ago looking to the development through temporary Federal aid of adequate State and local services for the health of children and the further stamping out of communicable disease particularly in the rural sections

 Although these agreements secured the maximum reduction of fleets which it was at that time possible to attain I am hopeful that the naval powers party to these agreements will realize that establishment of relative strength in itself offers opportunity for further reduction without injury to any of them

 If the world is to regain its standards of life it must further decrease both naval and other arms

 Apprehensions of such collapse had demoralized our agricultural and security markets and so threatened other nations as to impose further dangers upon us

 Upon our further initiative an agreement was made by Germany s private creditors providing for an extension of such credits until the German people can develop more permanent and definite forms of relief

 A few exceptional localities will be further organized

 FURTHER MEASURES The major economic forces and weaknesses at home and abroad have now been exposed and can be appraised and the time is ripe for forward action to expedite our recovery

 The paralysis has been further augmented by the steady increase in recent years of the proportion of bank assets invested in long term securities such as mortgages and bonds

 All of this tends to stifle business especially the smaller units and finally expresses itself in further depression of prices and values in restriction on new enterprise and in increased unemployment

 It is my further view that the additional taxation should be imposed solely as an emergency measure terminating definitely two years from July next

 To go further than these limits in either expenditures taxes or borrowing will destroy confidence denude commerce and industry of its resources jeopardize the financial system and actually extend unemployment and demoralize agriculture rather than relieve it

 FEDERAL LAND BANKS I recommend that the Congress authorize the subscription by the Treasury of further capital to the Federal land banks to be retired as provided in the original act or when funds are available and that repayments of such capital be treated as a fund available for further subscriptions in the same manner

 Such action would further decentralize our credit structure

 The establishment of the mortgage discount banks herein referred to will also contribute to further reserve strength in the banks without inflation

 We must avoid burdens upon the Government which will create more unemployment in private industry than can be gained by further expansion of employment by the Federal Government

 The Administrator of Veterans Affairs advises that a further appropriation of is required at once to meet the obligations made necessary by existing legislation

 There will be demands for further veterans legislation there are inequalities in our system of veterans relief it is our national duty to meet our obligations to those who have served the Nation

 REORGANIZATION OF FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS I have referred in previous messages to the profound need of further reorganization and consolidation of Federal administrative functions to eliminate overlap and waste and to enable coordination and definition of Government policies now wholly impossible in scattered and conflicting agencies which deal with parts of the same major function

 I shall lay before the Congress further recommendations upon this subject particularly in relation to the Department of the Interior

 As a result of vigorous and industrious action it is up to date in the consideration of pending references and is prepared to give prompt attention to any further applications

 Education and science have made further advances

 And they are ready and eager to make whatever further contributions are needed to win the war as quickly as possible if only they are given the chance to know what is required of them

 I shall from time to time communicate with the Congress with respect to these and further proposals

 Further desperate attempts may well be made to break our lines to slow our progress

 At that time it was our plan to approach the Philippines by further stages taking islands which we may call A C and E

 The need is too pressing to await the outcome of further efforts at recruiting

 I shall communicate further with the Congress on these subjects at a later date

 I am not willing that the vitality of our people be further sapped by the giving of cash of market baskets of a few hours of weekly work cutting grass raking leaves or picking up 

 I suggested in the spring of that or percent of all the people in the world were content with the territorial limits of their respective Nations and were willing further to reduce their armed forces if every other Nation in the world would agree to do likewise

 We have no further concern with how you keep your home or what you pay for your money

 To go no further back than the beginning of this century men and women everywhere were seeking conditions of life very different from those which were customary before modern invention and modern industry and modern communications had come into being

 If it is met if the purchasing power of the Nation as a whole in other words the total of the Nation s income can be still further increased other happy results will flow from such increase

 The proposed budget for which I shall shortly send to the Congress will exhibit a further decrease in the deficit though not a balance between income and outgo

 As this Seventy sixth Congress opens there is need for further warning

 The Congress of course needs no further information on this

 We are ahead of schedule in building warships but we are working to get even further ahead of that schedule

 Civilian use of them will have to be cut further and still further and in many cases completely eliminated

 We may suffer further setbacks

 I can further assure the Congress that the program as a whole is well within our capacity to finance it

 These and other problems which may face us can be met by the cooperation of all of us in furthering a positive and well balanced Government program a program which will further national and international well being

 At Moscow the United States the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Great Britain agreed to further this development by supporting the efforts of the national government and nongovernmental Chinese political elements in bringing about cessation of civil strife and in broadening the basis of representation in the Government

 Even if substantial further withdrawals from the labor market occur unemployment will increase temporarily

 I further recommend that this legislation include adequate authority for chartering vessels both here and abroad

 It will now expire unless further extended on June 

 I am in full accord with the proposal now pending in the Congress that the statutory minimum be raised immediately to cents an hour with further increases to cents after one year and to cents after two years

 Since the surrender of Japan civilian food consumption has risen still further

 I believe that further appropriations will be needed for the same purpose for the fiscal year 

 Rapid demobilization inevitably means further overcrowding

 The comprehensive health program which I recommended on November will require substantial additions to the Social Security System and in conjunction with other changes that need to be made will require further consideration of the financial basis for social security

 Further assistance is desirable and essential

 It should continue its historic role of leadership and advice and for the purpose of equalizing educational opportunity it should extend further financial support to the cause of education in areas where this is desirable

 I expect that by next June we shall have made a further reduction of equal magnitude and that there will be continuing reductions during the next fiscal year

 Further adjustments to compensate for increased living costs are required

 The so called aftermath of war expenditures account for a further percent of the total

 The possibility of further tax reductions must depend on the budgetary situation and the economic situation

 Moreover inflationary pressures still appear dangerously powerful and ill advised tax reduction would operate to strengthen them still further

 Further cut backs and accelerated demobilization have made possible an additional reduction in the rate of war spending

 and the further rescissions which I have recommended excluding duplications and deferred cash payments on existing authorizations represent a cut in the authorized war program of 

 However substantial further rescissions can and should be made when the war liquidation program tapers off and budgetary requirements for national defense are clarified

 In view of the urgent need for the Bank s credit I may find it necessary to request a further increase in its lending authority at a later date

 Of this total percent must be paid immediately and the Bank is required to call a further percent of the subscription during its first year of operations

 The recommended total for for general government like the estimates for national defense and other specific programs does not allow for the further salary increases for Government employees which I hope will be authorized by pending legislation but the tentative lump sum estimates under proposed legislation contemplate that such salary increases will be effective almost at once

 It is not expected that this increase will cause expenditures to exceed postal revenues in either year although an excess of expenditures may occur in the fiscal year if salaries are increased further

 A second unjustifiable practice is the secondary boycott when used to further jurisdictional disputes or to compel employers to violate the National Labor Relations Act

 One administrative change would help greatly to further our national program in the fields of health education and welfare

 History will judge us not by the money we spend but by the further contribution we enable our veterans to make to their country

 Further dispute and delay would gravely jeopardize political stability in the countries concerned for many years

 Our forces at home are at a point where further reduction is impracticable

 The industrial application of atomic energy and other scientific advances will constantly open up further opportunities for expansion

 A further step which I consider of even greater importance is the early provision for universal training

 The health of our economy and its maintenance at high levels further require that the minimum wage fixed by law should be raised to at least cents an hour

 Moreover we need and we must have without further delay a system of prepaid medical insurance which will enable every American to afford good medical care

 We have made great progress in the last year in the effective organization of our Armed Forces but further improvements in our national security legislation are necessary

 If we can continue in the spirit of cooperative adventure which has marked the recent years of our progress we can expect further scientific advances further increases in our standard of living and a still wider enjoyment of democratic freedom

 To further improve our fiscal outlook we should make some changes in our tax system which will reduce present inequities stimulate business activity and yield a moderate amount of additional revenue

 The Economic Report and the Budget Message will discuss these subjects further

 In Indochina and Malaya our aid has helped our allies to hold back the Communist advance although there are signs of further trouble in that area

 We will do that at any rate except where the recent amendments to the law specifically require us to give further price increases

 Further advances require action by Congress and I hope that means will be provided to give the Members of the Senate and the House a chance to vote on them

 I intend to submit further recommendations to this end

 Prices have risen further than they should have done but incomes by and large have risen even more so that real living standards are now considerably higher than seven years ago

 I further recommend that the Congress take the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act under immediate study and extend it by appropriate legislation

 A balanced budget is an essential first measure in checking further depreciation in the buying power of the dollar

 Meanwhile the Department of Labor is at once beginning work to devise further specific recommendations for your consideration

 In the next fiscal year we estimate a further reduction in expenditures of more than 

 We are also reducing further our requests for new appropriations

 Fourth until those claims on our Government s revenues are further reduced the growth in the public debt cannot be entirely stopped

 As additional reductions in expenditures are brought gradually but surely into sight further reductions in taxes can and will be made

 We must further simplify customs administration and procedures

 It is now clear that defense and other essential government costs must remain at a level precluding further tax reductions this year

 Although excise and corporation income taxes must therefore be continued at their present rates further tax cuts will be possible when justified by lower expenditures and by revenue increases arising from the nation s economic growth

 In further recognition of the importance of transportation to our economic strength and security the Administration through a Cabinet committee is thoroughly examining existing Federal transportation policies to determine their effect on the adequacy of transportation services

 Second I renew my recommendation of last year for amendment of the Labor Management Relations Act of to further the basic objectives of this statute

 Many new items of business likewise require our attention measures that will further promote the release of the energies of our people that will broaden opportunity for all of them that will advance the Republic in its leadership toward a just peace measures in short that are essential to the building of an everstronger ever better America

 We need to encourage investment overseas by avoiding unfair tax duplications and to foster foreign trade by further simplification and improvement of our customs legislation

 Under conditions of high peacetime prosperity such as now exist we can never justify going further into debt to give ourselves a tax cut at the expense of our children

 I shall propose measures to strengthen individual commodity programs to remove controls where possible to reduce carryovers and to stop further accumulations of surpluses

 Legislation to provide a modern interstate highway system is even more urgent this year than last for months have now passed in which we have fallen further behind in road construction needed for the personal safety the general prosperity the national security of the American people

 With these considerations in mind the Administration will present its recommendations for further expansion of coverage and other steps which can be taken wisely at this time

 The needed amendments should be enacted without further delay

 There will soon be recommended to the Congress a program further to advance the efforts of the Government within the area of Federal responsibility to accomplish these objectives

 I am happy to report substantial progress in the flow of immigrants under the Refugee Relief Act of however I again request this Congress to approve without further delay the urgently needed amendments to that act which I submitted in the last Session

 Concerning developments in another vital sector of our economy agriculture I am gratified that the long slide in farm income has been halted and that further improvement is in prospect

 Moreover the Federal government constantly alert to signs of weakening in any part of our economy always stands ready with its full power to take any appropriate further action to promote renewed business expansion

 This means further improvements in equipment mobility tactics and fire power

 Further all of us know that to advance the cause of freedom we must do much more than help build sound economies

 Further we must induce all industrialized nations of the Free World to work together in a new cooperative endeavor to help lift the scourge of poverty from less fortunate nations

 This will provide for better sharing of this burden and for still further profitable trade

 The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has been established the NATO alliance has been militarily strengthened the Organization of American States has been further developed as an instrument of inter American cooperation the Anzus treaty has strengthened ties with Australia and New Zealand and a mutual security treaty with Japan has been signed

 There will be further setbacks before the tide is turned

 We shall need further anti crime mass transit and transportation legislation and new tools to fight air pollution

 I now urge that its coverage be extended without further delay to provide health insurance for the elderly

 Merely to keep the present ratio of doctors and dentists from declining any further we must over the next years increase the capacity of our medical schools by percent and our dental schools by percent

 It recognizes further that the nuclear defense of the West is not a matter for the present nuclear powers alone that France will be such a power in the future and that ways must be found without increasing the hazards of nuclear diffusion to increase the role of our other partners in planning manning and directing a truly multilateral nuclear force within an increasingly intimate NATO alliance

 INCREASED PROSPERITYWe can help insure continued prosperity through a regional recovery program to assist the development of stricken areas left behind by our national progress further efforts to provide our workers with the skills demanded by modern technology for the laboring man is an indispensable force in the American system the extension of the minimum wage to more than million unprotected workers the improvement and the modernization of the unemployment compensation system

 Well let us rather ask them Who will they sacrifice Are they going to sacrifice the children who seek the learning or the sick who need medical care or the families who dwell in squalor now brightened by the hope of home Will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed the beauty of our land the hope of our poor Time may require further sacrifices

 Now we must answer whether our gains shall be the foundations of further progress or whether they shall be only monuments to what might have been abandoned now by a people who lacked the will to see their great work through

 We are there because the Congress has pledged by solemn vote to take all necessary measures to prevent further aggression

 The Asia of tomorrow will be far different because we have said in Vietnam as we said years ago in Korea This far and no further

 This year I am asking for adequate funds for economic assistance in the hope that we can further peace throughout the world

 Adequate control requires further advances in engine design and fuel composition

 Inflation will be further reduced this year

 Under this plan the Federal Government will provide the States and localities with more money and less interference and by cutting down the interference the same amount of money will go a lot further

 The further away government is from people the stronger government becomes and the weaker people become

 And looking further into the future we hope there can eventually be agreement on the mutual reduction of arms

 As other nations move rapidly forward in technology the answer to the new competition is not to build a wall around America but rather to remain competitive by improving our own technology still further and by increasing productivity in American industry

 In coming weeks I will send to the Congress further State of the Union reports on specific areas of policy including economic affairs natural resources human resources community development and foreign and defense policy

 In this year we will be negotiating with the Soviet Union to place further limits on strategic nuclear arms

 Further I will not hesitate to veto any new spending programs adopted by the Congress

 I will take further steps to improve the quality of medical and hospital care for those who have served in our Armed Forces

 A further agreement to limit the strategic arms race may be achieved

 Never again should we neglect a growing crisis like the shortage of energy where further delay will only lead to more harsh and painful solutions

 We must continue the recovery and further cut unemployment and inflation

 A further billion cut in excise taxes will give more relief and also contribute directly to lowering the rate of inflation

 Our new budget reverses that trend and later I hope to bring the Government s toll down even further

 We have reconfirmed our commitment to the defense of Europe and this year we will demonstrate that commitment by further modernizing and strengthening our military capabilities there

 And it can begin the process of negotiating new agreements which will further limit nuclear arms

 We continue to pursue these specific goals first to protect the present and long range interests of the United States secondly to preserve the lives of the American hostages and to secure as quickly as possible their safe release if possible to avoid bloodshed which might further endanger the lives of our fellow citizens to enlist the help of other nations in condemning this act of violence which is shocking and violates the moral and the legal standards of a civilized world and also to convince and to persuade the Iranian leaders that the real danger to their nation lies in the north in the Soviet Union and from the Soviet troops now in Afghanistan and that the unwarranted Iranian quarrel with the United States hampers their response to this far greater danger to them

 In the s we helped to contain further Soviet challenges in Korea and in the Middle East and we rearmed to assure the continuation of that containment

 We are now engaged in further negotiations to provide full autonomy for the people of the West Bank and Gaza to resolve the Palestinian issue in all its aspects and to preserve the peace and security of Israel

 I m prepared to lower these imports still further if the other oil consuming countries will join us in a fair and mutual reduction

 To implement the results of our early efforts in this field I submitted legislation to Congress designed to further the development of minority business

 We cannot afford further delay in this vital area

 These changes will further simplify administration and reduce fraud and error will make the program more responsive to the needs of the elderly and disabled and will increase the cap on allowable program expenditures

 Just three and a half months ago my Administration and the Congress successfully concluded over two years of work on a major reauthorization bill that further expands benefits to postsecondary education

 That legislation was later complemented by the Disability Insurance Amendments of which further bolstered the disability insurance program and reduced certain inequities among beneficiaries

 To further strengthen the social security system and provide a greater degree of assurance to beneficiaries given projected future economic uncertainties additional action should be taken

 Further we have secured legislation updating the Federal Government s emergency authority to provide support for the housing industry through the Brooke Cranston program and creating a new Section housing stimulus program

 We have made some progress To further develop the nation s waterways my Administration began construction of a new foot lock at the site of Lock and Dam on the Mississippi River

 and Chinese shipping services linking the two countries and will provide further momentum to the growth of Sino American trade

 Services provided by the VA health care system will be further targeted to the special needs of disabled veterans during the coming year

 As the median age of the American veteran population increases we must concentrate on further changes within the VA system to keep it independent and to serve as a model to the nation and to the world as a center for research treatment and rehabilitation

 I have worked to improve the relationship between the Federal establishment and the Government of the District of Columbia in order to further the goals and spirit of home rule

 With effective implementation these steps should allow further substantial paperwork cuts in the years ahead

 This additional incentive to participate will further strengthen the reserve

 Should these pressures continue further actions might be required

 Fifth we remain deeply committed to the process of mutual and verifiable arms control particularly to the effort to prevent the spread and further development of nuclear weapons

 This successful drawdown in our nuclear stockpile was a further tangible demonstration of our commitment to the updating of our existing theater nuclear forces in Europe

 MIDDLE EAST In the Middle East our determination to consolidate what has already been achieved in the peace process and to buttress that accomplishment with further progress toward a comprehensive peace settlement must remain a central goal of our foreign policy

 And we are discussing with a number of our area friends further ways we can help to improve their security and ours both for the short and the longer term

 Great progress has been achieved by these countries in increasing food production international cooperation in harnessing the great river resources of South Asia would contribute further to this goal and help to increase energy production

 As the nations of this hemisphere prepare to move further into the s I am struck by the depth of underlying commitment that there is to our common principles non intervention peaceful settlement of disputes cooperation for development democracy and defense of basic human rights

 I leave office satisfied that the political economic social and organizational basis for further progress with respect to all these principles have been substantially strengthened in the past four years

 The work of our own Institute of Scientific and Technological Cooperation will further strengthen the search for relevant new agricultural technologies

 Thus one of the central objectives of my Administration has been to control the proliferation of nuclear weapons to those nations which do not have them and their further development by the existing nuclear powers notably the Soviet Union and the United States

 Shortly you will receive from me a message on further reforms we intend to install some new but others long recommended by your own congressional committees

 We re encouraged by the bipartisan initiative of the House and are hopeful of further progress as the Senate continues its deliberations

 If the events in Poland continue to deteriorate further measures will follow

 So before we go any further I ask you to join with me in saluting the members of the Commission who are here tonight and Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker and Speaker Tip O Neill for a job well done

 The single thing the single thing that can start the wheels of industry turning again is further reduction of interest rates

 Now some insist that any further budget savings must be obtained by reducing the portion spent on defense

 In addition we could examine the possibility of achieving further outlay savings based on the work of the Grace commission

 Last year I asked Treasury Secretary then Regan to develop a plan to simplify the tax code so all taxpayers would be treated more fairly and personal tax rates could come further down

 Consistent with safety standards we will continue removing restraints on the bus and railroad industries we will soon end up legislation or send up legislation I should say to return Conrail to the private sector where it belongs and we will support further deregulation of the trucking industry

 Further after seeing how devastating illness can destroy the financial security of the family I am directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr

 Let it never be said of this generation of Americans that we became so obsessed with failure that we refused to take risks that could further the cause of peace and freedom in the world

 It brings the deficit down further

 And so tonight I am announcing a major new step for a further reduction in U

 They know we must make sure that control of the world s oil resources does not fall into his hands only to finance further aggression

 Further for the untold number of hard working responsible American workers and businessmen and women who ve been forced to go without needed bank loans the banking credit crunch must end

 This year many people urged me to cut our defense spending further to pay for other government programs

 The budget I send to Congress draws the line against further defense cuts

 We must not cut defense further

 The third thing we have to do is to build on the Brady Bill the Brady Law to take further steps to take further steps to keep guns out of the hands of criminals

 But further I urge you to consider this As you demand tougher penalties for those who choose violence let us also remember how we came to this sad point

 And the people in the vast middle got very little growth and people who worked like crazy but were on the bottom then fell even further and further behind in the years afterward no matter how hard they worked

 Now I challenge Congress to go further to curb special interest influence in politics by passing the first truly bipartisan campaign reform bill in a generation

 Now we should go further and do better by making it a felony for any parent to cross a state line in an attempt to flee from this his or her most sacred obligation

 They were pursued and defeated on their return to the coast and Athens took no further part in the Ionian war

 All hope of further conquest in Europe for the time was abandoned and the baffled armada returned to the Asiatic coasts

 The voluntary suffrage of the Greek cities of the coasts and islands of the AEgean first placed Athens at the head of the confederation formed for the further prosecution of the war against Persia

 Large reinforcements from Corinth Thebes and other cities now reached the Syracusans while the baffled and dispirited Athenian general earnestly besought his countrymen to recall him and represented the further prosecution of the siege as hopeless

 The effect of this oblique movement was to bring the phalanx and his own wing nearly beyond the limits of the ground which the Persians had prepared for the operations of the chariots and Darius fearing to lose the benefit of this arm against the most important parts of the Macedonian force ordered the Scythian and Bactrian cavalry who were drawn up on his extreme left to charge round upon Alexander s right wing and check its further lateral progress

 And even when Hannibal learned that his brother was in Italy and had advanced as far as Placentia he was obliged to pause for further intelligence before he himself commenced active operations as he could not tell whether his brother might not be invited into Etruria to aid the party there that was disaffected to Rome or whether he would march down by the Adriatic Sea

 Hannibal returned to his former head quarters at Canusium and halted there in expectation of further tidings of his brother s movements

 Arminius lured him to advance a little further into the country and then assailed him and fought a battle which by the Roman accounts was a drawn one

 The enduring importance of the battle of Tours in the eyes of the Moslems is attested not only by the expressions of the deadly battle and the disgraceful overthrow which their writers constantly employ when referring to it but also by the fact that no further serious attempts at conquest beyond the Pyrenees were made by the Saracens

 Harold replied with expressions of assent and further agreed at William s request to marry William s daughter Adela and to send over his own sister to be married to one of William s barons

 You may fly to the sea but you can fly no further you will find neither ships nor bridge there there will be no sailors to receive you and the English will overtake you there and slay you in your shame

 The Normans were to be seen following up their stratagem retreating slowly so as to draw the English further on

 After his fall the remnant of the English abandoned all further resistance

 The SLEEVE is another manner of thing than it was taken for we find it by experience and daily observation to be miles over a large room for me to look unto But after some time further reports that the Spaniards were inactive in their harbour where they were suffering severely from sickness caused Howard also to relax in his vigilance and he returned to Plymouth with the greater part of his fleet

 The assault on Blenheim though bravely made was repulsed with severe loss and Marlborough finding how strongly that village was garrisoned desisted from any further attempts to carry it and bent all his energies to breaking the enemy s line between Blenheim and Oberglau

 An irresistible force would be concentrated so as to crush all further opposition in New England and when this was done it was believed that the other colonies would speedily submit

 It was not difficult to diffuse an opinion that the war in effect was over and that any further resistance could serve only to render the terms of their submission the worse

 While resolute recruits accustomed to the use of fire arms and all partially trained by service in the provincial militias were thus flocking to the standard of Gates and Arnold at Saratoga and while Burgoyne was engaged at Port Edward in providing the means for the further advance of his army through the intricate and hostile country that still lay before him two events occurred in each of which the British sustained loss and the Americans obtained advantage the moral effects of which were even more important than the immediate result of the encounters

 They wanted to take me back again with them but I spoke to them of particular objects I had in view and they left me without further dissuasion to my well known singular caprice

 The lateness of the hour and the exhausted state of the French troops who had been marching and fighting since ten in the morning made him pause from advancing further to attack the much more important position of Quatre Bras

 He was pressing forward to further advantages when the fifth infantry division under Sir Thomas Picton and the Duke of Brunswick s corps appeared upon the scene

 Napoleon himself has found fault with Wellington for not having retreated further so as to complete a junction of his army with Blucher s before he risked a general engagement

 Maitland s men were lying down in order to avoid as far as possible the destructive effect of the French artillery which kept up an unremitting fire from the opposite heights until the first column of the Imperial Guard had advanced so far up the slope towards the British position that any further firing of the French artillerymen would have endangered their own comrades

 Nearly all the Frenchmen who had forced their way in were killed on the spot and as the few survivors ran back five of the Guards Colonel Macdonnell Captain Wyndham Ensign Gooch Ensign Hervey and Sergeant Graham by sheer strength closed the gate again in spite of the efforts of the French from without and effectually barricaded it against further assaults

 The th like those whom they rescued advanced much further against the French position than prudence warranted

 Further ambitions Jane had none

 Going are you Well I hope this new society of yours will be able to keep Avonlea from running any further down hill but I haven t much hope of it

it s going further down

 Anne knew that she had made herself ridiculous and that the incident would be laughed over that night at a score of tea tables but the knowledge only angered her further

 Under the firs were velvety cushions of moss and further on where the trees were smaller and fewer the ground was rich in a variety of green growing things

 Allan says it is on the principle of calling a place a grove because there are no trees in it said Diana for nobody lives along the road except the Copp girls and old Martin Bovyer at the further end who is a Liberal

 No we may as well go and spend the evening since we have come this far A few yards further on the girls came to a place where the road forked again

 At seventeen dreams DO satisfy because you think the realities are waiting for you further on

 Marilla glanced at the radiant young face and refrained from further sarcastic comments

 I no further offend you than becomes me for my good

 Marry I pr ythee do to make sport withal but love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again

 I pray you bear with me I can go no further

 Dear master I can go no further O I die for food Here lie I down and measure out my grave

 Silvius the time was that I hated thee And yet it is not that I bear thee love But since that thou canst talk of love so well Thy company which erst was irksome to me I will endure and I ll employ thee too But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employ d

 In the great hall were several servants the men standing together near the hall door and the women clinging together in the further corners and doorways

I feared to follow the thought further but read on conscious that the eyes of both Miss Trelawny and the Detective were fixed on me

 Another and another lay further along the floor as though forming a clue to where the sick man now lay

 I did not wait to look further at present for my attention was demanded by more pressing things but I determined to make a more minute examination when I should have time

 His first thought was for his patient but when he found him without further harm he visited Nurse Kennedy

 If once a thing gets to Scotland Yard it is out of our power to keep it quiet and further secrecy may be impossible

 What meant that odd raised place I said nothing to Miss Trelawny for I feared lest I should either frighten her or buoy her up with future hopes but I made up my mind that I would take an early opportunity for further investigation

 Corbeck without making further complications and embarrassing us

 Trelawny and further his secret wishes by your silence or your speech

 We considered that there might be some shock to a woman s mind in matters of apparent mystery and further that she being Mr

 To this end I went further into the mountains where I met with an Arab Sheik who was willing to take service with me

 I would have remained longer and made further research in the wrappings of the mummy but that I feared so to do

 Moreover was I tempted to seek further as in examining the wrappings I saw many things of strange import in that wondrous tomb including a casket of eccentric shape made of some strange stone which methought might have contained other jewels inasmuch as it had secure lodgment in the great sarcophagus itself

 We made an encampment close at hand but behind a jutting rock a little further along the valley so that they might not have the inscription always before them

 But the King had gone to further lengths and had had his daughter taught magic by which she had power over Sleep and Will

 She had been an apt pupil and had gone further than her teachers

 We made out the symbolism to be that her body immortal and transferable at will ruled both the land and water air and fire the latter being exemplified by the light of the Jewel Stone and further by the flint and iron which lay outside the mummy wrappings

 This grew as we drew near till finally at the entrance of the valley he halted and refused to go further

 I could get no further however

 On further examining the other side of the opening I found a similar spot indicated by other representations of the constellation but this was itself a figure of the seven stars and each was wrought in burnished gold

 I had been tracing it for nearly a year always suffering disappointment but always buoyed up to further endeavour by a growing hope that I was on the track

 After some forty or fifty steps cut in a winding passage we came to a great cave whose further end tapered away into blackness

 If we reject the evidence of a further passage in the Cuckoo and the Nightingale a poem of disputed genuineness we accordingly arrive at the conclusion that there is no reason for demurring to the only direct external evidence in existence as to the date of Chaucer s birth

 In his Nun s Priest s Tale he further enlivens one of the liveliest descriptions of a hue and cry ever put upon paper by a direct reference to the Peasants Rebellion So hideous was the noise ah bencite That of a truth Jack Straw and his meinie Not made never shoutes half so shrill When that they any Fleming meant to kill

 Thus there is a tone of genuine attachment to the vested interest principle and of aversion from all such interlopers as lay preachers and the like in the Host s exclamation uttered after the Reeve has been in his own style sermoning on the topic of old age What availeth all this wit What should we speak all day of Holy Writ The devil surely made a reeve to preach for which he is as well suited as a cobbler would be for turning mariner or physician Thus then in the England of Chaucer s days we find the Church still in possession of vast temporal wealth and of great power and privileges as well as of means for enforcing unity of profession which the legislation of the Lancastrian dynasty stimulated by the prevailing fears of heresy was still further to increase

 He owes to the French poem both the germs of felicitous phrases such as the famous designation of Nature as the Vicar of the almighty Lord and perhaps touches used by him in passages like that in which he afterwards with further aid from other sources drew the character of a true gentleman

 But in accordance with the taste of his age which shunned such sheer straightforwardness in poetry the Book of the Duchess contains no further transparent reference to the actual circumstances of the wedded life which had come to so premature an end for John of Gaunt had married Blanche of Lancaster in and an elaborate framework is constructed round the essential theme of the poem

 By a warrant of the same month Chaucer was granted the pension of pounds for life already mentioned for services rendered by him and his wife to the Duke and Duchess of Lancaster and to the Queen by two successive grants of the year he received further pecuniary gratifications of a more or less temporary nature and he continued to receive his pension and allowance for robes as one of the royal esquires

 But the courtly poets of the romantic age of literature went a step further and added a mediaeval colouring all their own

 A further proof of the relatively late date of this Prologue occurs in the contingent offer which it makes of the poem to the Queen who can be no other than Richard II s young consort Anne

 I will no further speak of this matter

 For here we have him writing to his little Lewis with fatherly satisfaction in the ability displayed by the boy to learn sciences touching numbers and proportions and telling how after making a present to the child of a sufficient astrolabe as for our own horizon composed after the latitude of Oxford he has further resolved to explain to him a certain number of conclusions connected with the purposes of the instrument

 Unluckily we know nothing further of Lewis not even whether as has been surmised he died before he had been able to turn to lucrative account his calculating powers after the fashion of his apocryphal brother Thomas or otherwise

 Further evidence of his straits is to be found in his having in the year obtained letters of protection against arrest making him safe for two years

 After bantering his friend on account of his faint heartedness in love Because thy lady saw not thy distress Therefore thou gavest her up at Michaelmas Chaucer ends by entreating him to further his claims upon the royal munificence

 Hence when Master Harry Bailly s tremendous oaths produce the gentlest of protests from the Parson the jovial Host incontinently smells a Lollard in the wind and predicts with a further flow of expletives that there is a sermon to follow

 This distrust on Chaucer s part requires no further illustration after what has been said elsewhere it would have been well for his age if all its children had been as clear sighted in these matters as he to whom the practices connected with these delusive sciences seemed and justly so from his point of view not less impious than futile

 To one further aspect of Chaucer s realism as a poet reference has already been made but a final mention of it may most appropriately conclude this sketch of his poetical characteristics

 To pursue the further traces of the influence of Chaucer through such a literary aftergrowth as the younger Fletchers into the early poems of Milton would be beyond the purpose of the present essay

 There is further compliment of leave taking between France and him

 We shall further think of it

 If your honour judge it meet I will place you where you shall hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction and that without any further delay than this very evening

 Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception I have perceived a most faint neglect of late which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness I will look further into t

 Go you before to Gloster with these letters acquaint my daughter no further with anything you know than comes from her demand out of the letter

 I will talk further with you

 I cannot daub it further

 Then shall you go no further

 Desire him to go in trouble him no more Till further settling

 With him I sent the queen My reason all the same and they are ready To morrow or at further space to appear Where you shall hold your session

 The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace that she might be further from the door

 Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry

 I knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them

 Darcy s further notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak

 Collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further and he continued My reasons for marrying are first that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness

 Let me do it without further loss of time

 My situation in life my connections with the family of de Bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into further consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you

 The necessity must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd

 To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further

 The rest of the evening passed with the APPEARANCE on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again

 He did trace them easily to Clapham but no further for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom

 Give me further particulars

 He begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her

 You may depend upon my seeking no further

 Darcy found on further inquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning

 And is such a girl to be my nephew s sister Is her husband is the son of his late father s steward to be his brother Heaven and earth of what are you thinking Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted You can now have nothing further to say she resentfully answered

 You have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew Unfeeling selfish girl Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody Lady Catherine I have nothing further to say

 When convinced on that article Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish

 From the further disadvantage of Lydia s society she was of course carefully kept and though Mrs

 Though Darcy could never receive HIM at Pemberley yet for Elizabeth s sake he assisted him further in his profession

 But at length by Elizabeth s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city

 For while the mind of man looketh upon second causes scat tered it may sometimes rest in them and go no further but when it beholdeth the chain of them confederate and linked together it must needs fly to Providence and Deity

 After having recounted several other stages in the migration of Androgyne s soul we shall mention them further on the latter has to give an answer why he has shifted his coat in these days of reformation and why his dogmatical silence has left him

 It included all the plays mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs excepting The Case is Altered the masques some fifteen that date between and another collection of lyrics and occasional poetry called Underwoods including some further entertainments a translation of Horace s Art of Poetry also published in a vicesimo quarto in and certain fragments and ingatherings which the poet would hardly have included himself

 and a little further on divum empta cante divum deo supplicante

 In no point does ancient comedy stand further apart from modern ideas than in its view of married life the wile is invariably the dull legal partner love for whom is hardly thought of while the sentiment of love if indeed it be worthy of the name is reserved for the Bacchis and Thais who in the most popular plays turn out to be Attic citizens and so are finally united to the fortunate lover

 A little later we find the same mine further worked

 the Fasti were only advanced to the end of the sixth book when all further prosecution of them was stopped by the terrible news which struck the poet like a thunderbolt that he was ordered to leave Rome forever

 that most poets would not have pursued the theme further apparently he is led on by his interest in the subject or by the barrenness of his invention which could suggest no other

 Further on from the bright red windows of the Sword Fish Inn there came such fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard asphaltic pavement rather weary for me when I struck my foot against the flinty projections because from hard remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight

 Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark looking den the bar a rude attempt at a right whale s head

 I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed that if I should ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night I would put up with the half of any decent man s blanket

 What Captain Ahab Who but him indeed I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab when we heard a noise on deck

 And if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul much more did his far away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature and open him still further to those latent influences which in some honest hearted men restrain the gush of dare devil daring so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery

 For one I used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg or any one else off duty whom I might find there then ascending a little way further and throwing a lazy leg over the top sail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pastures and so at last mount to my ultimate destination

 Forced into familiarity then with such prodigies as these and knowing that after repeated intrepid assaults the White Whale had escaped alive it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous but immortal for immortality is but ubiquity in time that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks he would still swim away unharmed or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away his unsullied jet would once more be seen

 Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation when beholding the white depths of the milky way Or is it that as in essence whiteness is not so much a color as the visible absence of color and at the same time the concrete of all colors is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness full of meaning in a wide landscape of snows a colorless all color of atheism from which we shrink And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers that all other earthly hues every stately or lovely emblazoning the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods yea and the gilded velvets of butterflies and the butterfly cheeks of young girls all these are but subtile deceits not actually inherent in substances but only laid on from without so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel house within and when we proceed further and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues the great principle of light for ever remains white or colorless in itself and if operating without medium upon matter would touch all objects even tulips and roses with its own blank tinge pondering all this the palsied universe lies before us a leper and like wilful travellers in Lapland who refuse to wear colored and coloring glasses upon their eyes so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him

 CHAPTER The Affidavit So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book and indeed as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales the foregoing chapter in its earlier part is as important a one as will be found in this volume but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon in order to be adequately understood and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair

 Like some poor devils ashore that happen to known an irascible great man they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street lest if they pursued the acquaintance further they might receive a summary thump for their presumption

 But further investigations have recently proved to me that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean

 Having impulsively it is probable and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod s voyage Ahab was now entirely conscious that in so doing he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal his crew if so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all further obedience to him and even violently wrest from him the command

 Cook cook where s that old Fleece he cried at length widening his legs still further as if to form a more secure base for his supper and at the same time darting his fork into the dish as if stabbing with his lance cook you cook sail this way cook The old black not in any very high glee at having been previously routed from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour came shambling along from his galley for like many old blacks there was something the matter with his knee pans which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans this old Fleece as they called him came shuffling and limping along assisting his step with his tongs which after a clumsy fashion were made of straightened iron hoops this old Ebony floundered along and in obedience to the word of command came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb s sideboard when with both hands folded before him and resting on his two legged cane he bowed his arched back still further over at the same time sideways inclining his head so as to bring his best ear into play

 For before we proceed further it must be said that the monkey rope was fast at both ends fast to Queequeg s broad canvas belt and fast to my narrow leather one

 And yet still further pondering while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten to jam him still further pondering I say I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes only in most cases he one way or other has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals

 But before going further it is important to mention here that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet it is seldom done and when done is still less frequently successful on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance which in effect become serious drawbacks

 It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged harpoons were it not that as we advanced into the herd our whale s way greatly diminished moreover that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion the direful disorders seemed waning

 Further pursuit was useless but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waited

 Sounding him carefully Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris

 Opposite the mouth of the works on the further side of the wide wooden hearth was the windlass

 As they narrated to each other their unholy adventures their tales of terror told in words of mirth as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them like the flames from the furnace as to and fro in their front the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers as the wind howled on and the sea leaped and the ship groaned and dived and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth and viciously spat round her on all sides then the rushing Pequod freighted with savages and laden with fire and burning a corpse and plunging into that blackness of darkness seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander s soul

 On deck Captain Ahab said the reddening mate moving further into the cabin with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself A better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man aye and in a happier Captain Ahab

 As now he thus vainly strove the jaw slipped from him the frail gunwales bent in collapsed and snapped as both jaws like an enormous shears sliding further aft bit the craft completely in twain and locked themselves fast again in the sea midway between the two floating wrecks

 But only slipping further into the whale s mouth and tilting over sideways as it slipped the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw spilled him out of it as he leaned to the push and so he fell flat faced upon the sea

 And in these cases somewhat as a pilot when about losing sight of a coast whose general trending he well knows and which he desires shortly to return to again but at some further point like as this pilot stands by his compass and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote unseen headland eventually to be visited so does the fisherman at his compass with the whale for after being chased and diligently marked through several hours of daylight then when night obscures the fish the creature s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter as the pilot s coast is to him

 The features it should be further said were ruled by a certain expression which as the viewer chose might with equal correctness have been called the effect of intelligence love pity or sorrow though in better speech it was a blending of them all a look easy to fancy as the mark of a sinless soul doomed to the sight and understanding of the utter sinfulness of those among whom it was passing yet withal no one could have observed the face with a thought of weakness in the man so at least would not they who know that the qualities mentioned love sorrow pity are the results of a consciousness of strength to bear suffering oftener than strength to do such has been the might of martyrs and devotees and the myriads written down in saintly calendars

 Then Ben Hur bowing to the old men began again I fear to answer the question asked me about the Nazarene without first telling you some of the things I have seen him do and to that I am the more inclined my friends because to morrow he will come to the city and go up into the Temple which he calls his father s house where it is further said he will proclaim himself

 Then uncovering her head a further demand of the law she shouted shrilly Unclean unclean To her surprise the man came steadily on

 And when he further discovered that every part of the world was represented among them cities upon both shores of the Mediterranean far off as the Pillars of the West river towns in distant India provinces in northernmost Europe and that though they frequently saluted him with tongues unacquainted with a syllable of the old Hebrew of the fathers these representatives had all the same object celebration of the notable feast an idea tinged mistily with superstitious fancy forced itself upon him

 Further tell thy husband that for the harm I sought to do him I have been punished until even he would pity me

 Frightened as she was however she could not help wishing to see where yet further the stair could lead

 The men at arms redoubled their vigilance and for some time there was no further cause of alarm

 He instantly squatted in the hope of eluding further notice

 Question my lords no further of the case How or which way tis sure they found some place But weakly guarded where the breach was made

 O hold me not with silence over long Where I was wont to feed you with my blood I ll lop a member off and give it you In earnest of a further benefit So you do condescend to help me now

 Her terrtiory sic which now stretches from ocean to ocean contains a vast interior yet unpeopled and with a destiny of still further and continued expansion of area why should the gate of the temple be now shut upon sorrowing mankind Rather let it be that the gate should be forever open and an emblematic flag hereafter as heretofore wave a welcome to all to come to the modern Abdella fugitives from political oppression

 It would be to trespass on your kindness and to violate the proprieties of the occasion were I to detain the vast concourse which stands before me by entering on the discussion of controverted topics or by further indulging in the expression of such reflections as circumstances suggest

 A few miles further and he may site upon the quiet shore to listen to the murmuring wave until the troubled spirit sinks to rest and in the little sail that vanishes on the illimitable sea we may find the type of the voyage which he is so soon to take when his ephemeral existence closed he embarks for that better state which lies beyond the grave

 In the war with Mexico our armies carried their banners over routes hitherto unknown through mountain passes where nature had almost completed the work of defence and penetrated further into the enemy s country than any European army has ever marched from the source of its supplies

 The invitation of the Agricultural Society with the attendant circumstances serve further to impress me with the hospitality of ray fellow citizens of this State

 In what other land could a countryman go so far from his home and receive among strangers the attention which could only be expected from friends But it is not your kindness only which has caused me here to feel at home I have been brought in contact with men of my own pursuit the tillers of the ground and the breeders of stock and in my intercourse with this class of your citizens I have been further confirmed in the high estimate heretofore placed upon that portion of our population

 If you choose still further to stretch your vision to South Carolina you will find a parallel to that devotion to their country s cause which illustrates the early history of the Democrats of Boston

 And now my friends I would ask you further of what value would a congressional decision upon that subject be If it be a constitutional right as I contend it is then it is a matter for judicial decision

 But what further do they couple with these demands which they make for congressional legislation They proclaim their purpose to be to exclude paupers and criminals from abroad

 If they could effect their ends and Great Britain could insert the wedge which should separate the States what further use would she have for the northern section You are the competitors of Great Britain in the vast field of manufacture whom she most fears and though she may be with you in the scheme which would effect a separation of these States yet the moment that separation should be effected she would be under the promptings of interest your worst enemy

 The President removed him from office a further evidence of the sincerity with which he was fulfiling your expectations in relation to Kansas

 My mother had to abandon the quest but managed to extract from the restriction itself a further refinement of thought as great poets do when the tyranny of rhyme forces them into the discovery of their finest lines

 And just as she invariably protests that she does not need the extra gas which the porter offers to light for her and sits on there hearing nothing further except an occasional remark on the weather which the porter exchanges with a messenger whom he will send off suddenly when he notices the time to put some customer s wine on the ice so having declined Fran oise s offer to make me some tea or to stay beside me I let her go off again to the servants hall and lay down and shut my eyes and tried not to hear the voices of my family who were drinking their coffee in the garden

 A single word from Mamma would have been an admission that further intercourse with me was within the bounds of possibility and that might perhaps have appeared to me more terrible still as indicating that with such a punishment as was in store for me mere silence and even anger were relatively puerile

 Accordingly having to reckon again with vulgarity my grandmother would endeavour to postpone the moment of contact still further

 I compel my mind to make one further effort to follow and recapture once again the fleeting sensation

 Her own room looked out over the Rue Saint Jacques which ran a long way further to end in the Grand Pr as distinct from the Petit Pr a green space in the centre of the town where three streets met and which monotonous and grey with the three high steps of stone before almost every one of its doors seemed like a deep furrow cut by some sculptor of gothic images in the very block of stone out of which he had fashioned a Calvary or a Crib

 Its memorial stones beneath which the noble dust of the Abbots of Combray who were buried there furnished the choir with a sort of spiritual pavement were themselves no longer hard and lifeless matter for time had softened and sweetened them and had made them melt like honey and flow beyond their proper margins either surging out in a milky frothing wave washing from its place a florid gothic capital drowning the white violets of the marble floor or else reabsorbed into their limits contracting still further a crabbed Latin inscription bringing a fresh touch of fantasy into the arrangement of its curtailed characters closing together two letters of some word of which the rest were disproportionately scattered

 And in the evening as I came in from my walk and thought of the approaching moment when I must say good night to my mother and see her no more the steeple was by contrast so kindly there at the close of day that I would imagine it as being laid like a brown velvet cushion against as being thrust into the pallid sky which had yielded beneath its pressure had sunk slightly so as to make room for it and had correspondingly risen on either side while the cries of the birds wheeling to and fro about it seemed to intensify its silence to elongate its spire still further and to invest it with some quality beyond the power of words

 Sazerat one s eyes followed the line where it ran low again beyond the farther descending slope and one knew that it would be the second turning after the steeple or yet again if pressing further afield one went to the station one saw it obliquely shewing in profile fresh angles and surfaces like a solid body surprised at some unknown point in its revolution or from the banks of the Vivonne the apse drawn muscularly together and heightened in perspective seemed to spring upwards with the effort which the steeple made to hurl its spire point into the heart of heaven it was always to the steeple that one must return always it which dominated everything else summing up the houses with an unexpected pinnacle raised before me like the Finger of God Whose Body might have been concealed below among the crowd of human bodies without fear of my confounding It for that reason with them

 Unfortunately I was not able to set at rest by further talks with Bloch in which I might have insisted upon an explanation the doubts he had engendered in me when he told me that fine lines of poetry from which I if you please expected nothing less than the revelation of truth itself were all the finer if they meant absolutely nothing

 But I was fond of Bloch my parents wished me to be happy and the insoluble problems which I set myself on such texts as the absolutely meaningless beauty of La fille de Minos et de Pasipha tired me more and made me more unwell than I should have been after further talks with him unwholesome as those talks might seem to my mother s mind

 And if she found it amusing that the nonplussed visitor should not have known beforehand that we had our luncheon an hour earlier on Saturday it was still more irresistibly funny that my father himself fully as she sympathised from the bottom of her heart with the rigid chauvinism which prompted him should never have dreamed that the barbarian could fail to be aware of so simple a matter and so had replied with no further enlightenment of the other s surprise at seeing us already in the dining room You see it s Saturday

 On reaching this point in the story Fran oise would pause to wipe the tears of merriment from her eyes and then to add to her own enjoyment would prolong the dialogue inventing a further reply for the visitor to whom the word Saturday had conveyed nothing

 Legrandin had we insisted further would in the end have constructed a whole system of ethics and a celestial geography of Lower Normandy sooner than admit to us that within a mile of Balbec his own sister was living in her own house sooner than find himself obliged to offer us a letter of introduction the prospect of which would never have inspired him with such terror had he been absolutely certain as from his knowledge of my grandmother s character he really ought to have been certain that in no circumstances whatsoever would we have dreamed of making use of it

 In the first weeks of our Combray holidays when the days ended early we would still be able to see as we turned into the Rue du Saint Esprit a reflection of the western sky from the windows of the house and a band of purple at the foot of the Calvary which was mirrored further on in the pond a fiery glow which accompanied often by a cold that burned and stung would associate itself in my mind with the glow of the fire over which at that very moment was roasting the chicken that was to furnish me in place of the poetic pleasure I had found in my walk with the sensual pleasures of good feeding warmth and rest

 But at other times while my parents were growing impatient at seeing me loiter behind instead of following them my actual life instead of seeming an artificial creation by my father and one which he could modify as he chose appeared on the contrary to be comprised in a larger reality which had not been created for my benefit from whose judgments there was no appeal in the heart of which I was bound helpless without friend or ally and beyond which no further possibilities lay concealed

 As for his hosts they knew that it was a recently published work which the musicians whom they had engaged for the evening had asked to be allowed to play but as these last were now on tour somewhere Swann could learn nothing further

 He would come away from an evening party jump into his victoria spread a rug over his knees tell the friends who were leaving at the same time and who insisted on his going home with them that he could not that he was not going in their direction then the coachman would start off at a fast trot without further orders knowing quite well where he had to go

 He could not explore the idea further for a sudden access of that mental lethargy which was with him congenital intermittent and providential happened at that moment to extinguish every particle of light in his brain as instantaneously as at a later period when electric lighting had been everywhere installed it became possible merely by fingering a switch to cut off all the supply of light from a house

 Good God Think of listening to Wagner for a fortnight on end with her who takes about as much interest in music as a fish does in little apples it will be fun And his hatred like his love needing to manifest itself in action he amused himself with urging his evil imaginings further and further because thanks to the perfidies with which he charged Odette he detested her still more and would be able if it turned out as he tried to convince himself that she was indeed guilty of them to take the opportunity of punishing her emptying upon her the overflowing vials of his wrath

 It sprang back thus without meeting any further resistance so irresistible in fact that Swann had been far less unhappy in watching the end gradually approaching day by day of the fortnight which he must spend apart from Odette than he was when kept waiting ten minutes while his coachman brought round the carriage which was to take him to her minutes which he passed in transports of impatience and joy in which he recaptured a thousand times over to lavish on it all the wealth of his affection that idea of his meeting with Odette which by so abrupt a repercussion at a moment when he supposed it so remote was once more present and on the very surface of his consciousness

 The fact was that this idea no longer found as an obstacle in its course the desire to contrive without further delay to resist its coming which had ceased to have any place in Swann s mind since having proved to himself or so at least he believed that he was so easily capable of resisting it he no longer saw any inconvenience in postponing a plan of separation which he was now certain of being able to put into operation whenever he would

 She he tried to ask himself what that meant for it is something like love like death rather than like those vague conceptions of maladies a thing which one repeatedly calls in question in order to make oneself probe further into it in the fear that the question will find no answer that the substance will escape our grasp the mystery of personality

 But he to whom up till then nothing could have seemed so tedious as was all that pertained to the cosmopolitan life of Baden or of Nice now that he learned that Odette had perhaps led a gay life once in those pleasure cities although he could never find out whether it had been solely to satisfy a want of money which thanks to himself she no longer felt or from some capricious instinct which might at any moment revive in her he would lean in impotent anguish blinded and dizzy over the bottomless abyss into which had passed in which had been engulfed those years of his own early in MacMahon s Septennat in which one spent the winter on the Promenade des Anglais the summer beneath the limes of Baden and would find in those years a sad but splendid profundity such as a poet might have lent to them and he would have devoted to the reconstruction of all the insignificant details that made up the daily round on the C te d Azur in those days if it could have helped him to understand something that still baffled him in the smile or in the eyes of Odette more enthusiasm than does the aesthete who ransacks the extant documents of fifteenth century Florence so as to try to penetrate further into the soul of the Primavera the fair Vanna or the Venus of Botticelli

 This compulsion to an activity without respite without variety without result was so cruel a scourge that one day noticing a swelling over his stomach he felt an actual joy in the idea that he had perhaps a tumour which would prove fatal that he need not concern himself with anything further that it was his malady which was going to govern his life to make a plaything of him until the not distant end

 de Gallardon then drew herself up and chilling her expression still further perhaps because she was still uneasy about the Prince s health said to her cousin Oriane at once Mme

 He knew that his memory of the piano falsified still further the perspective in which he saw the music that the field open to the musician is not a miserable stave of seven notes but an immeasurable keyboard still almost all of it unknown on which here and there only separated by the gross darkness of its unexplored tracts some few among the millions of keys keys of tenderness of passion of courage of serenity which compose it each one differing from all the rest as one universe differs from another have been discovered by certain great artists who do us the service when they awaken in us the emotion corresponding to the theme which they have found of shewing us what richness what variety lies hidden unknown to us in that great black impenetrable night discouraging exploration of our soul which we have been content to regard as valueless and waste and void

 d Orsan that he must place the untravelled region in which this ignoble action might have had its birth as none of these men had ever in conversation with Swann suggested that he approved of anonymous letters and as everything that they had ever said to him implied that they strongly disapproved he saw no further reason for associating this infamy with the character of any one of them more than with the rest

 Already he had begun to put further questions

 He could hear her answer alas how lightheartedly I ve heard that tale before He felt that she would tell him nothing more that evening that no further revelation was to be expected for the present

 I have a little thing here you re sure to like the manageress would greet him and he would stay for an hour or so talking dolefully to some poor girl who sat there astonished that he went no further

 All the more and because one cannot make a name extend much further in time than in space like some of Giotto s paintings themselves which shew us at two separate moments the same person engaged in different actions here lying on his bed there just about to mount his horse the name of Florence was divided into two compartments

 Even after I had returned home I did not taste them since every day the necessity which made me hope that on the morrow I should arrive at the clear calm happy contemplation of Gilberte that she would at last confess her love for me explaining to me the reasons by which she had been obliged hitherto to conceal it that same necessity forced me to regard the past as of no account to look ahead of me only to consider the little advantages that she had given me not in themselves and as if they were self sufficient but like fresh rungs of the ladder on which I might set my feet which were going to allow me to advance a step further and finally to attain the happiness which I had not yet encountered

 It shewed me further this new arrangement that I ought after all to know what it was to love since I loved Gilberte it drew my attention to the constant anxiety that I had to shew off before her by reason of which I tried to persuade my mother to get for Fran oise a waterproof coat and a hat with a blue feather or better still to stop sending with me to the Champs Elys es an attendant with whom I blushed to be seen to all of which my mother replied that I was not fair to Fran oise that she was an excellent woman and devoted to us all and also that sole exclusive need to see Gilberte the result of which was that months in advance I could think of nothing but how to find out at what date she would be leaving Paris and where she was going feeling that the most attractive country in the world would be but a place of exile if she were not to be there and asking only to be allowed to stay for ever in Paris so long as I might see her in the Champs Elys es and it had little difficulty in making me see that neither my anxiety nor my need could be justified by anything in Gilberte s conduct

 I ll about it this evening and I will presently pen down my dilemmas encourage myself in my certainty put myself into my mortal preparation and by midnight look to hear further from me

 Of the further development of the Drama in the age of Pericles Thirlwall says The drama was the branch of literature which peculiarly signalised the age of Pericles and it belongs to the political no less than to the literary history of these times and deserves to be considered in both points of view

 Shall I say more further to fire thy wrath OEDIPUS

 Ere thou dost question further leave that place Tis holy ground whereon thou mayest not tread

 he gave them further orders

 Democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation

 For further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to Sir George Cornwall Lewis s Historical Survey of the Astronomy of the Ancients London 

 The centres of the epicycles of Mars Jupiter and Saturn were supposed to be further away than the sun

 He also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moon s orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities

 The absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars

 The further consideration of the grand field of discovery opened out by Galileo with his telescopes must be now postponed to avoid discontinuity in the history of the intellectual development of this period which lay in the direction of dynamical or physical astronomy

 Having further proved the for that day wonderful proposition that with the law of inverse squares the attraction by the separate particles of a sphere of uniform density or one composed of concentric spherical shells each of uniform density acts as if the whole mass were collected at the centre he was able to express the meaning of Kepler s laws in propositions which have been summarised as follows The law of universal gravitation

 He further discovered from his calculations two new inequalities one of the apogee the other of the nodes and assigned the maximum value

 There may further be cases where the effects of luminous radiative repulsion become apparent and also Crookes vacuum effects described as radiant matter

 Passing now from these large reflectors to refractors further improvements have been made in the manufacture of glass by Chance of Birmingham Feil and Mantois of Paris and Schott of Jena while specialists in grinding lenses like Alvan Clark of the U

 But the last doubts have long vanished and a connection has been further traced between violent outbursts of solar activity and simultaneous magnetic storms

 Following this by further observation he found that the motions were not uniform nor rectilinear and by a clear analysis of the movements he established the remarkable and wholly unexpected fact that in all these cases the motion is due to a revolution about their common centre of gravity

 By all means they say make use of working hypotheses to add an interest to years of laborious research and to serve as a guide to the direction of further labours but be sure not to fall into the error of calling any mere hypothesis a theory

 But the roar the awful deafening roar of those tumbling waters penned in the rocky subterranean vault Had the fall not entirely blocked my further passage and shown me that I had followed the wrong course I believe that I should have fled anyway before the maddening tumult

 Instead I did the one thing of all others that might rouse his anger and increase his hatred of me for I knew that if I died Dejah Thoris too would find a way to die before they could heap further tortures or indignities upon her

 If Kulan Tith wondered what business brought me in a flier to the very edge of his domain he was good enough not to press me further for an explanation which I should indeed have had difficulty in rendering

 But then my father s love asserted itself and I vowed that I would prefer eternal damnation to further separation from her if she could be found

 At the opening to the subterranean passage that led to their haven of refuge a mighty battle was fought in which the yellow men were victorious and within the caves that gave ingress to their new home they piled the bodies of the dead both yellow and green that the stench might warn away their enemies from further pursuit

 To attempt to pass through the midst of that fierce herd seemed even to me the height of folly and so I proposed to Thuvan Dihn that he return to the outer world with Woola that the two might find their way to civilization and come again with a sufficient force to overcome not only the apts but any further obstacles that might lie between us and our goal

 Further I advised him to call upon Kulan Tith and the son of Thuvan Dihn for warriors and ships that the expedition might be sufficiently strong to insure success at the first blow

 Thuvan Dihn followed directly after me and another moment found us at the further door undetected

 Sorav Talu had told us was the commander of the forces of the palace and as men from the further cities of Okar and especially Illall were less likely to be tainted with the germ of intrigue which had for years infected the household of Salensus Oll he was sure that we would be welcomed and few questions asked us

 He had primed us with such general information as he thought would be necessary for us to pass muster before Sorav after which we would have to undergo a further examination before Salensus Oll that he might determine our physical fitness and our ability as warriors

 That it would mean almost instant death for me I cared not except that it would remove me from further efforts in behalf of Dejah Thoris and for this reason alone I would have chosen another way for even though I should kill Salensus Oll that act would not restore my beloved wife to her own people

 My friend walked close beside me asking many silly questions about the country from which I had come until finally his fellows paid no further attention to him or his gabbling

 In an instant I saw that by attacking the Okarians from the rear I could so quickly disorganize them that their further resistance would be short lived and with this idea in mind I sprang from the dais casting a word of explanation to Dejah Thoris over my shoulder though I did not turn to look at her

 That there was something radically wrong with the flier was evident from its lack of buoyancy and the further fact that though Thurid had turned twice to the starting lever the boat still hung motionless in the air except for a slight drifting with a low breeze from the north

 I had been so paralyzed by surprise that I had made no move to reach the deck during the awe inspiring scene which I had just witnessed and now I was to be still further amazed by her next act for Phaidor extended her hand to me and assisted me to the deck where I stood gazing at her in unconcealed and stupefied wonderment

 People were beside themselves with delight over this new faculty and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant further discovered a moral faculty in man for at that time Germans were still moral not yet dabbling in the Politics of hard fact

 One must however go still further and also declare war relentless war to the knife against the atomistic requirements which still lead a dangerous after life in places where no one suspects them like the more celebrated metaphysical requirements one must also above all give the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which Christianity has taught best and longest the SOUL ATOMISM

 For if I had not already decided within myself what it is by what standard could I determine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps willing or feeling In short the assertion I think assumes that I COMPARE my state at the present moment with other states of myself which I know in order to determine what it is on account of this retrospective connection with further knowledge it has at any rate no immediate certainty for me

 If any one should find out in this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of free will and put it out of his head altogether I beg of him to carry his enlightenment a step further and also put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous conception of free will I mean non free will which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect

 If however a person should regard even the emotions of hatred envy covetousness and imperiousness as life conditioning emotions as factors which must be present fundamentally and essentially in the general economy of life which must therefore be further developed if life is to be further developed he will suffer from such a view of things as from sea sickness

 Not to cleave to one s own liberation to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird which always flies further aloft in order always to see more under it the danger of the flier

 This mode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE who perceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil doing and practically judge that it is STUPID to do wrong while they accept good as identical with useful and pleasant without further thought

 By the name with which I ventured to baptize them I have already expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is this because as critics in body and soul they will love to make use of experiments in a new and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense In their passion for knowledge will they have to go further in daring and painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic century can approve of There is no doubt these coming ones will be least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualities which distinguish the critic from the skeptic I mean the certainty as to standards of worth the conscious employment of a unity of method the wary courage the standing alone and the capacity for self responsibility indeed they will avow among themselves a DELIGHT in denial and dissection and a certain considerate cruelty which knows how to handle the knife surely and deftly even when the heart bleeds They will be STERNER and perhaps not always towards themselves only than humane people may desire they will not deal with the truth in order that it may please them or elevate and inspire them they will rather have little faith in TRUTH bringing with it such revels for the feelings

 OUR sympathy is a loftier and further sighted sympathy we see how MAN dwarfs himself how YOU dwarf him and there are moments when we view YOUR sympathy with an indescribable anguish when we resist it when we regard your seriousness as more dangerous than any kind of levity

 Perhaps what I have said here about a fundamental will of the spirit may not be understood without further details I may be allowed a word of explanation

 Without the PATHOS OF DISTANCE such as grows out of the incarnated difference of classes out of the constant out looking and down looking of the ruling caste on subordinates and instruments and out of their equally constant practice of obeying and commanding of keeping down and keeping at a distance that other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen the longing for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itself the formation of ever higher rarer further more extended more comprehensive states in short just the elevation of the type man the continued self surmounting of man to use a moral formula in a supermoral sense

 Hence we can understand without further detail why love AS A PASSION it is our European specialty must absolutely be of noble origin as is well known its invention is due to the Provencal poet cavaliers those brilliant ingenious men of the gai saber to whom Europe owes so much and almost owes itself

 It may happen too that in the frankness of my story I must go further than is agreeable to the strict usages of your ears Certainly the God in question went further very much further in such dialogues and was always many paces ahead of me 

 I like man and often think how I can still further advance him and make him stronger more evil and more profound

 I believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried groaning and bleeding into the log house

 At the second trial the aim was better and the ball descended inside the stockade scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage

 I was pretty far down on the low sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east and is joined at half water to Skeleton Island and now as I rose to my feet I saw some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes an isolated rock pretty high and peculiarly white in colour

 The white rock visible enough above the brush was still some eighth of a mile further down the spit and it took me a goodish while to get up with it crawling often on all fours among the scrub

 Hands and you ll please regard me as your captain until further notice

 And talking o trouble why did that doctor give me the chart Jim My face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the needlessness of further questions

 Well Silver replied the doctor if that is so I ll go one step further look out for squalls when you find it

 Soon they were chatting together with intervals of listening and not long after hearing no further sound they shouldered the tools and set forth again Merry walking first with Silver s compass to keep them on the right line with Skeleton Island

 And suddenly not ten yards further we beheld them stop

 He had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed one of the sacks of coin worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas to help him on his further wanderings

 His further instructions related to this manuscript which I was to retain sealed and unread just as I found it for eleven years nor was I to divulge its contents until twenty one years after his death

 Powell I knew was well armed and further an experienced Indian fighter but I too had lived and fought for years among the Sioux in the North and I knew that his chances were small against a party of cunning trailing Apaches

 Further speculation was suddenly cut short by the faint report of two shots far ahead of me

 I had forged ahead for perhaps a mile or more without hearing further sounds when the trail suddenly debouched onto a small open plateau near the summit of the pass

 I had gone but a short distance further when what seemed to be an excellent trail opened up around the face of a high cliff

 Further the heads of the adults are not so out of proportion to their bodies as in the case of the young

 I alighted upon the soft moss easily and without mishap and turning saw my enemies lined up along the further wall

 He then stopped as though waiting for my reply pricking up his antennae like ears and cocking his strange looking eyes still further toward me

 Tars Tarkas advanced toward me holding out one of his arms and we thus proceeded to the plaza without further mishap

 Both of Mars moons are vastly nearer her than is our moon to Earth the nearer moon being but about five thousand miles distant while the further is but little more than fourteen thousand miles away against the nearly one quarter million miles which separate us from our moon

 The further moon revolves about Mars in something over thirty and one quarter hours and with her sister satellite makes a nocturnal Martian scene one of splendid and weird grandeur

 They paid no further attention to me and I was thus permitted to remain close and watch their operations which consisted in breaking an opening in the wall of the incubator large enough to permit of the exit of the young Martians

 There was no further question of authority between us Woola was my devoted slave from that moment hence and I his only and undisputed master

 Tars Tarkas made some reply which I could not catch but which caused Lorquas Ptomel to smile after which they paid no further attention to me

 Ordinarily I am not given to long speeches nor ever before had I descended to bombast but I had guessed at the keynote which would strike an answering chord in the breasts of the green Martians nor was I wrong for my harangue evidently deeply impressed them and their attitude toward me thereafter was still further respectful

 Waving the women away I informed them that Sola would attend the captive hereafter and I further warned Sarkoja that any more of her cruel attentions bestowed upon Dejah Thoris would result in Sarkoja s sudden and painful demise

 Because John Carter she replied nearly every planet and star having atmospheric conditions at all approaching those of Barsoom shows forms of animal life almost identical with you and me and further Earth men almost without exception cover their bodies with strange unsightly pieces of cloth and their heads with hideous contraptions the purpose of which we have been unable to conceive while you when found by the Tharkian warriors were entirely undisfigured and unadorned

 And when you learn John Carter and if I be dead as likely I shall be ere the further moon has circled Barsoom another twelve times remember that I listened and that I smiled

 I turned without further word and sought out Tars Tarkas to whom I vehemently objected to the unnecessary humiliations and cruelties as they seemed to my lover s eyes that were being heaped upon Dejah Thoris

 She taught me rapidly the language and customs of my kind and one night she told me the story I have told to you up to this point impressing upon me the necessity for absolute secrecy and the great caution I must exercise after she had placed me with the other young Tharks to permit no one to guess that I was further advanced in education than they nor by any sign to divulge in the presence of others my affection for her or my knowledge of my parentage and then drawing me close to her she whispered in my ear the name of my father

 My mother shrank further back into the friendly shadows and from her hiding place saw that the expedition was not that of my father but the returning caravan bearing the young Tharks

 Without waiting for a further invitation I bolted up the winding runway which led to the second floor and entering a great chamber at the front of the building was greeted by the frenzied Woola who threw his great carcass upon me nearly hurling me to the floor the poor old fellow was so glad to see me that I thought he would devour me his head split from ear to ear showing his three rows of tusks in his hobgoblin smile

 Further conversation of a personal nature was prevented by the entrance of Sola who was much agitated and wholly unlike her usual calm and possessed self

 Removing the saddle trappings I hid them just within the rear doorway of the building through which we had entered the court and turning the beasts loose quickly made my way across the court to the rear of the buildings upon the further side and thence to the avenue beyond

 Presently the door commenced to recede before me until it had sunk into the wall fifty feet then it stopped and slid easily to the left exposing a short narrow corridor of concrete at the further end of which was another door similar in every respect to the one I had just passed

 It is said she will fall within the next few passages of the further moon

 Had nothing further than my own safety or pleasure been at stake no argument could have prevailed upon me to turn away the one creature upon Barsoom that had never failed in a demonstration of affection and loyalty but as I would willingly have offered my life in the service of her in search of whom I was about to challenge the unknown dangers of this to me mysterious city I could not permit even Woola s life to threaten the success of my venture much less his momentary happiness for I doubted not he soon would forget me

 By the mother of the further moon John Carter how came you here and have you become a Darseen that you can change your color at will You gave me a bad half minute my friend he continued after I had briefly outlined my adventures since parting with him in the arena at Warhoon

 When they had approached within a hundred yards their thoats again became unmanageable and absolutely refused to advance further toward the air craft which had frightened them

 Quickly completing the repairs we rose together into the still cloudless Martian sky and at great speed and without further mishap returned to Zodanga

 It is far from my desire to push war further against the people of Helium and your promise shall be recorded and a proclamation to my people issued forthwith

 The only order I require my friend to enter where I will hangs at my side I answered tapping my long sword will you let me pass in peace or no For reply he whipped out his own sword calling to the others to join him and thus the four stood with drawn weapons barring my further progress

 Gradually I left my pursuers further and further behind and I was just congratulating myself on my lucky escape when a well directed shot from the cruiser exploded at the prow of my little craft

 Her forces were entirely destroyed or captured and no further resistance was to be expected from within

 The lesser hordes had commenced looting and quarreling among themselves so it was decided that we collect what warriors we could man as many vessels as possible with Zodangan prisoners and make for Helium without further loss of time

 Further the power of God is very often likened to the power of kings

 We further showed Part i

 If we might pursue the subject further I could point out that the power which is commonly attributed to God is not only human as showing that God is conceived by the multitude as a man or in the likeness of a man but involves a negation of power

 Note Before going any further I wish to recall to mind what has been pointed out above namely that whatsoever can be perceived by the infinite intellect as constituting the essence of substance belongs altogether only to one substance consequently substance thinking and substance extended are one and the same substance comprehended now through one attribute now through the other

 Corollary Hence it follows that the human mind is part of the infinite intellect of God thus when we say that the human mind perceives this or that we make the assertion that God has this or that idea not in so far as he is infinite but in so far as he is displayed through the nature of the human mind or in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind and when we say that God has this or that idea not only in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind but also in so far as he simultaneously with the human mind has the further idea of another thing we assert that the human mind perceives a thing in part or inadequately

 Further if there were any other object of the idea constituting the mind besides body then as nothing can exist from which some effect does not follow I

 We may thus recognize the superiority of one mind over others and may further see the cause why we have only a very confused knowledge of our body and also many kindred questions which I will in the following propositions deduce from what has been advanced

 Further in the fact that they may be moved less or more quickly and may be absolutely in motion or at rest

 If we further conceive a third kind of individuals composed of individuals of this second kind we shall find that they may be affected in a still greater number of ways without changing their actuality

 they are refracted therefrom in a different manner from that which they followed before such change and further when afterwards they impinge on the new surfaces by their own spontaneous movement they will be refracted in the same manner as though they had been impelled towards those surfaces by external bodies consequently they will while they continue to be thus refracted affect the human body in the same manner whereof the mind II

 Further to retain the usual phraseology the modifications of the human body of which the ideas represent external bodies as present to us we will call the images of things though they do not recall the figure of things

 And hence we can further clearly understand why the mind from the thought of one thing should straightway arrive at the thought of another thing which has no similarity with the first for instance from the thought of the word pomum an apple a Roman would straightway arrive at the thought of the fruit apple which has no similitude with the articulate sound in question nor anything in common with it except that the body of the man has often been affected by these two things that is that the man has often heard the word pomum while he was looking at the fruit similarly every man will go on from one thought to another according as his habit has ordered the images of things in his body

 Further this idea or knowledge of the mind does not follow from God in so far as he is infinite but in so far as he is affected by another idea of an individual thing II

 Further the ideas of the modifications whereby the body is affected involve the nature of the human body itself II

 in so far as God is regarded as affected by the idea of a further thing which II

 And who I ask can know that he understands anything unless he do first understand it In other words who can know that he is sure of a thing unless he be first sure of that thing Further what can there be more clear and more certain than a true idea as a standard of truth Even as light displays both itself and darkness so is truth a standard both of itself and of falsity

 Further how comes it that men have false ideas Lastly how can anyone be sure that he has ideas which agree with their objects These questions I repeat I have in my opinion sufficiently answered

 Further II

 Further no one doubts that we imagine time from the fact that we imagine bodies to be moved some more slowly than others some more quickly some at equal speed

 But before I proceed further I would here remark that by the will to affirm and decide I mean the faculty not the desire

 Further this affirmation cannot be made II

 It is further necessary that they should distinguish between idea and words whereby we signify things

 Further I grant that no one can be deceived so far as actual perception extends that is I grant that the mind s imaginations regarded in themselves do not involve error II

 Further I absolutely deny that we are in need of an equal power of thinking to affirm that that which is true is true and to affirm that that which is false is true

 Further as it tells us that each should be content with his own and helpful to his neighbour not from any womanish pity favour or superstition but solely by the guidance of reason according as the time and occasion demand as I will show in Part III

 By the time Tip had picked himself up and cleared the dust from his throat so he could say Whoa there was no further need of saying it for the horse was long since out of sight

 Some time I will surely overtake them he reflected for the road will end at the gates of the Emerald City and they can go no further than that

 The Saw Horse now ambled forward at a pace so fast that its riders had hard work to stick upon its back so there was little further conversation until they drew up beside the palace steps

 But we dare not go to the Emerald City and the Gump is probably carrying us further in the wrong direction with every flop of its wings

 Now he said joyously his fine eyes ablaze you re my own girl aren t you By way of further conclusion her head lay softly upon his shoulder

 He took it for granted that she was doing very well and he was relieved of further worry

 The ice being thus broken he launched into further observation pretending to forget that her fingers were still retained by his

 He would have gone on further with his little flirtation but the taste for it was temporarily removed

 He did not try to simulate indifference further

 The physician had a thought or two of his own but dismissed the matter as worthy of no further discussion on his part at least

 she decided that it would be no use to seek further to day so she got on a car and went to Lincoln Park

 She came bravely enough to the showy entrance way with the polished and begilded lobby set with framed pictures out of the current attraction leading up to the quiet box office but she could get no further

 Therefore he was in no mood for anything save such words as would further his plans distinctly

 He pressed her closer and kissed her and she felt that further opposition was useless

 No further opportunity for conversation occurred but the next evening when they were getting ready for the stage this girl appeared anew at her side

 A further enlargement of this chasm between them came when the manager looking between the wings upon the brightly lighted stage where the chorus was going through some of its glittering evolutions said to the master of the ballet Who is that fourth girl there on the right the one coming round at the end now Oh said the ballet master that s Miss Madenda

 It spoke for itself almost without further action on his part

 Curiously this stirred Hurstwood to further effort

 The vegetation was similar to that which covers the lawns of the red Martians of the great waterways but the trees and birds were unlike anything that I had ever seen upon Mars and then through the further trees I could see that most un Martian of all sights an open sea its blue waters shimmering beneath the brazen sun

 As I rose to investigate further I experienced the same ridiculous catastrophe that had met my first attempt to walk under Martian conditions

 To my left the sea extended as far as the eye could reach before me only a vague dim line indicated its further shore while at my right a mighty river broad placid and majestic flowed between scarlet banks to empty into the quiet sea before me

 As I had been scrutinizing this weird monstrosity the balance of the herd had fed quite close to me and I now saw that while many had the smaller specimens dangling from them not all were thus equipped and I further noted that the little ones varied in size from what appeared to be but tiny unopened buds an inch in diameter through various stages of development to the full fledged and perfectly formed creature of ten to twelve inches in length

 Tars Tarkas went in advance and as I reached the first of the horizontal bars I drew the ladder up after me and handing it to him he carried it a hundred feet further aloft where he wedged it safely between one of the bars and the side of the shaft

 How far we traversed the tunnel in this manner I do not know but presently we came to an obstruction which blocked our further progress

 But no further sound broke the stillness nor within the range of our vision did aught move

 Quickly I walked toward the mournful voice but it had ceased ere I reached the further wall and then from the other end of the chamber came another voice shrill and piercing Fools Fools it shrieked

 As long as we remained each facing an opposite end of the apartment no further attacks were made upon us so it was quite clear to me that the partitions were in some way pierced that our actions might be observed from without

 Come then I cried we must make the start for we could not be further from escape than we now are in the heart of this mountain and within the four walls of this chamber of death

 At Thuvia s suggestion two of the released prisoners bore the body of the dead thern upon their shoulders with us as we continued our journey toward the storeroom which we reached without further mishap

 By this time I was so thoroughly fagged out that I could go no further so I threw myself upon the floor bidding Tars Tarkas to do likewise and cautioning two of the released prisoners to keep careful watch

 With a final effort he threw himself further back upon the deck at the same instant releasing his hold upon the rail to tear frantically with both hands at my fingers in an effort to drag them from his throat

 The nearer moon had passed below the horizon but the clear effulgence of the further satellite bathed the deck of the cruiser bringing into sharp relief the bodies of six or eight black men sprawled about in sleep

 For countless ages they lived their long lives within their hard shells hopping and skipping about the broad planet falling into rivers lakes and seas to be still further spread about the surface of the new world

 They bore the earmarks of prisons which were further accentuated by the armed guards who squatted on low benches without or patrolled the short beach lines

 One of the officers who had accompanied us advanced to a large door in the further end of the chamber

 Of course who would dare doubt I doubt yes and further I deny I said

 I will say a few more words Xodar with no intent to wound your feelings further but rather that you may give thought to the fact that while we live we are still more the arbiters of our own fate than is any god

 He was about to reply when the outer door of our prison opened and a burly guard entered and ordered him to his own quarters for the night locking the door after him as he passed through into the further chamber

 The black grumbled something that I could not understand and then I heard him unlocking the door into one of the other cells on the further side

 Presently we came upon our destination a great amphitheatre situated at the further edge of the plain and about half a mile beyond the garden walls

 One was on her knees with imploring hands outstretched toward Issus but the hideous deity only leaned further forward in keener anticipation of the entertainment to come

 He gave me a peculiar look but said nothing further on the subject

 As the sun rose and the light of a new day swept away the darkness of night our craft gave a final spasmodic plunge turned half upon her side and then with deck tilting at a sickening angle swung in a slow circle her bow dropping further below her stern each moment

 I was much depressed over the news of Dejah Thoris disappearance and now there was added the further burden of apprehension concerning the fate of this girl whom I believed to be the daughter of some proud Barsoomian house and it had been my intention to make every effort to return her to her people

 I was about to ask Kantos Kan to prosecute a further search for her when a flier from the flagship of the fleet arrived at the Xavarian with an officer bearing a message to Kantos Kan from Arras

 Hope not to save thy cowardly carcass by inventing horrid lies to But he got no further

 Kantos Kan was sombre in contemplation of the further calamity that might fall upon Helium should Zat Arras attempt to follow the age old precedent that allotted a terrible death to fugitives from the Valley Dor

 It is enough he said that I jeopardize my life here and hereafter by countenancing you at all do not ask me to add still further to my sins by listening to what I have always been taught was the rankest heresy

 And know you further by witness of thine own eyes that see him here now upon the Pedestal of Truth that he has indeed returned from these sacred precincts in the face of our ancient customs and in violation of the sanctity of our ancient religion

 But when I had finished Zat Arras arose and turning to the judges said in a low tone My nobles you have heard John Carter s plea every opportunity has been given him to prove his innocence if he be not guilty but instead he has but utilized the time in further blasphemy

 Zat Arras will permit you in due time to reflect further upon the magnanimous offer he has made you

 It had not yet been discovered and in order to still further delay search and mystify the jed s people we carried the body with us for a short distance hiding it in a tiny cell off the main corridor of the pits beneath an adjoining estate

 A cruiser awaits above at your own dock let us leave at A fusillade of shots from the palace gardens just without cut short his further words

 My commanders were further instructed than when engaged with an enemy to draw him as rapidly as possible toward a ship of his hereditary foeman and by careful manoeuvring to force the two to engage thus leaving him self free to withdraw

 Then we turned on the buoyance rays in the balance of them and let them rise by themselves to further block the passage to Omean as they came into contact with the vessels already lodged there

 The smoke from the fire was forcing me further and further back down the corridor toward the waters which I could hear surging through the darkness

 Its sole occupant lay prone upon a low couch at the further side apparently in sleep

 The blacks were massed at the entrance to a great chamber where they were attempting to block the further progress of a body of red men toward the inner sacred precincts of the temple

 Carthoris where are the apartments of Issus This way cried the boy and without waiting to know that I had heard him he dashed off at breakneck speed further into the bowels of the temple

 Massive bars blocked our further progress but beyond I saw her my incomparable Princess and with her were Thuvia and Phaidor

 Thuvia and Phaidor came close also but when Thuvia saw that we would be alone she withdrew to the further side of the chamber

 There was a great deal of noise even shouting in a room further away one could hear the laughter of a crowd of people and nasty little shrieks in French there were ladies at the dinner

 If I held out and pretended not to notice these stares he would still in silence proceed to further tortures

 I had got to the point of purposely refraining from beginning in order to embarrass her further it was awkward for her to begin alone

 So she had managed to fling it from her hand on the table at the moment when I had dashed into the further corner

 Further the soul is often engaged in resisting the affections of the body as Homer describes Odysseus rebuking his heart

 He will only ask for a further admission that beauty is the cause of the beautiful greatness the cause of the great smallness of the small and so on of other things

 It has faded into the distance by a natural process as it was removed further and further from the historical fact on which it has been supposed to rest

 When we speak of the immortality of the soul we must ask further what we mean by the word immortality

 Thirdly we may think of them as possessed by a great love of God and man working out His will at a further stage in the heavenly pilgrimage

 For Plato and Aristotle are not further removed in their teaching about the immortality of the soul than they are in their theory of knowledge

 The analogy may even be pressed a step further We are more certain of our ideas of truth and right than we are of the existence of God and are led on in the order of thought from one to the other

 The succession of arguments is based on previous philosophies beginning with the mysteries and the Heracleitean alternation of opposites and proceeding to the Pythagorean harmony and transmigration making a step by the aid of Platonic reminiscence and a further step by the help of the nous of Anaxagoras until at last we rest in the conviction that the soul is inseparable from the ideas and belongs to the world of the invisible and unknown

 And shall we proceed a step further and affirm that there is such a thing as equality not of one piece of wood or stone with another but that over and above this there is absolute equality Shall we say so Say so yes replied Simmias and swear to it with all the confidence in life

 Still I suspect that you and Simmias would be glad to probe the argument further

 Must we not said Socrates ask ourselves what that is which as we imagine is liable to be scattered and about which we fear and what again is that about which we have no fear And then we may proceed further to enquire whether that which suffers dispersion is or is not of the nature of soul our hopes and fears as to our own souls will turn upon the answers to these questions

 And further is not one part of us body another part soul To be sure

 And do you further observe that after a man is dead the body or visible part of him which is lying in the visible world and is called a corpse and would naturally be dissolved and decomposed and dissipated is not dissolved or decomposed at once but may remain for a for some time nay even for a long time if the constitution be sound at the time of death and the season of the year favourable For the body when shrunk and embalmed as the manner is in Egypt may remain almost entire through infinite ages and even in decay there are still some portions such as the bones and ligaments which are practically indestructible Do you agree Yes

 And I rejoiced to think that I had found in Anaxagoras a teacher of the causes of existence such as I desired and I imagined that he would tell me first whether the earth is flat or round and whichever was true he would proceed to explain the cause and the necessity of this being so and then he would teach me the nature of the best and show that this was best and if he said that the earth was in the centre he would further explain that this position was the best and I should be satisfied with the explanation given and not want any other sort of cause

 And if any one assails you there you would not mind him or answer him until you had seen whether the consequences which follow agree with one another or not and when you are further required to give an explanation of this principle you would go on to assume a higher principle and a higher until you found a resting place in the best of the higher but you would not confuse the principle and the consequences in your reasoning like the Eristics at least if you wanted to discover real existence

 Or if any one asks you why a body is diseased you will not say from disease but from fever and instead of saying that oddness is the cause of odd numbers you will say that the monad is the cause of them and so of things in general as I dare say that you will understand sufficiently without my adducing any further examples

 Then Cebes beyond question the soul is immortal and imperishable and our souls will truly exist in another world I am convinced Socrates said Cebes and have nothing more to object but if my friend Simmias or any one else has any further objection to make he had better speak out and not keep silence since I do not know to what other season he can defer the discussion if there is anything which he wants to say or to have said

 Yes Simmias replied Socrates that is well said and I may add that first principles even if they appear certain should be carefully considered and when they are satisfactorily ascertained then with a sort of hesitating confidence in human reason you may I think follow the course of the argument and if that be plain and clear there will be no need for any further enquiry

 The rivers flowing in either direction can descend only to the centre and no further for opposite to the rivers is a precipice

 When they had driven up the further hill and around a corner Matthew said We re pretty near home now

 To do her justice she really believed Anne had made Diana drunk out of sheer malice prepense and she was honestly anxious to preserve her little daughter from the contamination of further intimacy with such a child

 As a result Diana had abstained from any further imitative flights of imagination and did not think it prudent to cultivate a spirit of belief even in harmless dryads

 Oh I m so proud Diana flung the paper on the table and herself on Anne s bed utterly breathless and incapable of further speech

 Smiling blushing limpid eyed Anne tripped back and gave a quaint funny little selection that captivated her audience still further

 Jane was smiling and happy examinations were over and she was comfortably sure she had made a pass at least further considerations troubled Jane not at all she had no soaring ambitions and consequently was not affected with the unrest attendant thereon

These men despised the predictions and threats of the prophets who declared to them from God that the city should be destroyed and the inhabitants carried into captivity and they made use of this kind of argument against the prophets that the city so far from being like to be destroyed had lately been augmented by the building of new houses from whence they further inferred by way of a proverb using the similitude of a cauldron out of which the flesh is not taken till it is thoroughly boiled and fit to be eaten that they should not be carried away out of their city but there end their days in peace

 His light clothes though frayed with his adventures were of fine and almost foppish cut and he wore a pointed beard or imperial perhaps as a further reminiscence of Louis Napoleon but he was a much taller and more graceful man that his prototype

 The more closely he watched them as they stood listening to the revelations of the detective the more puzzled he was by their attitude Fisher seemed grieved by the death of his uncle but hardly shocked at it the older man seemed almost openly thinking about something else and neither had anything to suggest about a further pursuit of the fugitive spy and murderer in spite of the prodigious importance of the documents he had stolen

 Of the region lying further on towards the North of this country no one can declare accurately who the men are who dwell in it but the parts which lie immediately beyond the Ister are known to be uninhabited and vast in extent

 Now the Thracians say that the other side of the Ister is occupied by bees and that by reason of them it is not possible to pass through and proceed further but to me it seems that when they so speak they say that which is not probable for these creatures are known to be intolerant of cold and to me it seems that the regions which go up towards the pole are uninhabitable by reason of the cold climate

 Cleomenes then pleased by the counsel of the child departed into another room and Aristagoras went away from Sparta altogether and had no opportunity of explaining any further about the way up from the sea to the residence of the king

 Thus the Athenians were freed from despots and the things worthy to be narrated which they did or suffered after they were liberated up to the time when Ionia revolted from Dareios and Aristagoras the Milesian came to Athens and asked them to help him these I will set forth first before I proceed further

 The Epidaurians then asked further whether they should make images of bronze or of stone and the prophetess bade them not use either of these but make them of the wood of a cultivated olive tree

 Then when the people of Lampsacos were perplexed in their counsels as to what that saying should mean with which Cr sus had threatened them namely that he would destroy them utterly like a pine tree at length one of the elder men with difficulty perceived the truth and said that a pine alone of all trees when it has been cut down does not put forth any further growth but perishes being utterly destroyed

 Xerxes spoke to him thus and Artabanos was not willing to obey the command at first since he did not think himself worthy to sit upon the royal throne but at last being urged further he did that which was commanded first having spoken these words a It is equally good in my judgment O king whether a man has wisdom himself or is willing to follow the counsel of him who speaks well and thou who hast attained to both these good things art caused to err by the communications of evil men just as they say that the Sea which is of all things the most useful to men is by blasts of winds falling upon it prevented from doing according to its own nature

 Nay I have heard further that he sent branders also with them to brand the Hellespont

 The land I say becomes hostile to thee in this way if nothing shall come to oppose thee the land is hostile to thee by so much the more in proportion as thou shalt advance more ever stealing on further and further for there is no satiety of good fortune felt by men and this I say that with no one to stand against thee the country traversed growing more and more as time goes on will produce for thee famine

 Of the Satrians those who act as prophets of the temple are the Bessians it is a prophetess who utters the oracles as at Delphi and beyond this there is nothing further of a remarkable character

 Nay but make thou no further mention of this condition namely that we should deliver the leadership to thee but if thou art desirous to come to the assistance of Hellas know that thou wilt be under the command of the Lacedemonians and if thou dost indeed claim not to be under command come not thou to our help at all

 The Barbarians accordingly with Xerxes were advancing to the attack and the Hellenes with Leonidas feeling that they were going forth to death now advanced out much further than at first into the broader part of the defile for when the fence of the wall was being guarded they on the former days fought retiring before the enemy into the narrow part of the pass but now they engaged with them outside the narrows and very many of the Barbarians fell for behind them the leaders of the divisions with scourges in their hands were striking each man ever urging them on to the front

 I understand Herodotus to state that though the vessels lay of course in the direction of the stream from the Hellespont that is presenting their prows or sterns to the stream yet this did not mean that they pointed straight towards the Propontis and Euxine for the stream after passing Sestos runs almost from North to South with even a slight tendency to the East hence eurou a few lines further on so that ships lying in the stream would point in a line cutting at right angles that of the longer axis from East to West of the Pontus and Propontis

 advancing insensibly further

 Some take kleptomenos as passive insensibly lured on further

 An indication that the historian intended to carry his work further than the year 

 Then if that which I expect come to pass and we gain a victory with our ships the Barbarians will not come to you at the Isthmus nor will they advance further than Attica but they will retire in disorder and we shall be the gainers by the preservation of Megara and Egina and Salamis at which place too an oracle tells us that we shall get the victory over our enemies

 The Hellenes meanwhile having resolved not to pursue after the ships of the Barbarians further nor to sail to the Hellespont to break up the passage were investing Andros intending to take it for the Andrians were the first of the islanders who being asked by Themistocles for money refused to give it and when Themistocles made proposals to them and said that the Athenians had come having on their side two great deities Persuasion and Compulsion and therefore they must by all means give them money they replied to this that not without reason as it now appeared was Athens great and prosperous since the Athenians were well supplied with serviceable deities but as for the Andrians they were poor having in this respect attained to the greatest eminence and there were two unprofitable deities which never left their island but always remained attached to the place Poverty namely and Helplessness and the Andrians being possessed of these deities would not give money for never could the power of the Athenians get the better of their inability

 There is also another story reported as follows namely that when Xerxes on his march away from Athens came to E on on the Strymon from that point he did not continue further to make marches by road but delivered his army to Hydarnes to lead back to the Hellespont while he himself embarked in a Phenician ship and set forth for Asia and as he sailed he was seized by a wind from the Strymon violent and raising great waves and since he was tossed by the storm more and more the ship being heavily laden for there were upon the deck great numbers of Persians those namely who went with Xerxes the king upon that falling into fear shouted aloud and asked the pilot whether there were for them any means of safety

 Now Abdera is situated further towards the Hellespont than the river Strymon and E on from which place the story says that he embarked in the ship

 They then since they had suffered a heavy blow did not advance further up towards the West nor did any one compel them to do so but they remained still in Samos and kept watch over Ionia lest it should revolt having three hundred ships including those of the Ionians and they did not expect that the Hellenes on their part would come to Ionia but thought that it would satisfy them to guard their own land judging from the fact that they had not pursued after them in their flight from Salamis but were well contented then to depart homewards

 Thus at the same time it so chanced that the Barbarians dared sail no further up towards the West than Samos being smitten with fear and the Hellenes no further down towards the East than Delos when the Chians made request of them

 Then when the army in its march came to B otia the Thebans endeavoured to detain Mardonios and counselled him saying that there was no region more convenient for him to have his encampment than that and they urged him not to advance further but to sit down there and endeavour to subdue to himself the whole of Hellas without fighting for to overcome the Hellenes by open force when they were united as at the former time they were of one accord together was a difficult task even for the whole world combined but they proceeded if thou wilt do that which we advise with little labour thou wilt have in thy power all their plans of resistance

 After this they resolved to come down further towards Plataia for the region of Plataia was seen to be much more convenient for them to encamp in than that of Erythrai both for other reasons and because it is better watered

 So while the greater number of the guards stayed at their posts some ran to the generals and when they reached them they said that a man had come riding on a horse out of the camp of the Medes who discovered nothing further but only named the generals and said that he desired to have speech with them

 So Amompharetos and his men were coming up to join them and the cavalry also of the Barbarians was at the same time beginning to attack them in full force for the horsemen did on this day as they had been wont to do every day and seeing the place vacant in which the Hellenes had been posted on the former days they rode their horses on continually further and as soon as they came up with them they began to attack them

 The other cut short the rest of the speech stopping all that Hegesistratos had intended to say further and said I accept the augury given in Hegesistratos stranger of Samos

 Nothing further happened than this as they went on their way but they arrived at Sardis

 Having so done they sailed away to Hellas taking with them besides other things the ropes also of the bridges in order to dedicate them as offerings in the temples and for that year nothing happened further than this

 Her secret being at last given to the world and the name of the lady friend being even adumbrated Jacky made no further experiments in the difficult and tiring art of conversation

 The waves were colourless and the Bournemouth steamer gave a further touch of insipidity drawn up against the pier and hooting wildly for excursionists

 Bryce was the tenant who had no right to sublet to have defined him further was a waste of time

 Don t let this go any further

 They attributed the change to her marriage and perhaps some deep instinct did warn her not to travel further from her husband than was inevitable

 The servants went to bed and Charles visited his father again to receive further instructions

 No account of these events has ever been given at all approaching reality in their details either as regards himself or others nor shall I further allude to them than to remark that the errors of action committed by a man as noble and generous as Shelley may as far as he only is concerned be fearlessly avowed by those who loved him in the firm conviction that were they judged impartially his character would stand in fairer and brighter light than that of any contemporary

 In the Fourth Act the Poet gives further scope to his imagination and idealizes the forms of creation such as we know them instead of such as they appeared to the Greeks

 Of the Castle of Petrella I could obtain no further information than that which is to be found in the manuscript

 I pray that you prepare yourselves for Rome There the Pope s further pleasure will be known

 CAMILLO I overrule Further proceedings and in the behalf Of these most innocent and noble persons Will use my interest with the Holy Father

 CYPRIAN Permit one question further is the lady Impossible to hope or not LELIO She is So excellent that if the light of day Should excite Floro s jealousy it were Without just cause for even the light of day Trembles to gaze on her

 Are there not hopes within thee which this scene Of linked and gradual being has confirmed Whose stingings bade thy heart look further still When to the moonlight walk by Henry led Sweetly and sadly thou didst talk of death And wilt thou rudely tear them from thy breast Listening supinely to a bigot s creed Or tamely crouching to the tyrant s rod Whose iron thongs are red with human gore Never but bravely bearing on thy will Is destined an eternal war to wage With tyranny and falsehood and uproot The germs of misery from the human heart

 It is an incontrovertible fact the consideration of which ought to repress the hasty conclusions of credulity or moderate its obstinacy in maintaining them that had the Jews not been a fanatical race of men had even the resolution of Pontius Pilate been equal to his candour the Christian religion never could have prevailed it could not even have existed on so feeble a thread hangs the most cherished opinion of a sixth of the human race When will the vulgar learn humility When will the pride of ignorance blush at having believed before it could comprehend Either the Christian religion is true or it is false if true it comes from God and its authenticity can admit of doubt and dispute no further than its omnipotent author is willing to allow

 But he never doubted the truth or utility of his opinions and in printing and privately distributing Queen Mab he believed that he should further their dissemination without occasioning the mischief either to others or himself that might arise from publication

 Further the colonel entered into a bond of to one Mrs Barbara Midford sister or pretended sister of the said Robert and so finally was threatened with outlawry by Captain Midford for presumably payment of these debts

 Out of a dutiful Regard to the said Lady Gould his Mother in Law Colonel Fielding declares himself unwilling to Controvert anything with her further than of necessity

 Further he professes himself a protestant of the Communion of the Church of England and asserts that he shall and will breed his said children Protestants of that communion

 And it was further ordered that the children then at school continue at such schools till further order and that upon any breaking up at ye usuall times they do go and reside with ye Lady Gould their Grandmother that they may not be under the influence of ye Defendant Fielding s Wife who appeared to be a papist

 Further the efforts of the impetuous youth would seem to have extended to threatened assaults on the person of his fair cousin s guardian Mr Tucker for we find that affrighted worthy flying for protection to the arm of the law as recorded in the Register Book of Lyme Regis under date of the th November 

 Of the struggles of these early years struggles never wholly remitted for to quote Lady Mary again Fielding would have wanted money had his hereditary lands been as extensive as his imagination we get further suggestions in the Poetical Epistle addressed to Sir Robert Walpole when the young poet was but twenty three

 A few further points of minor interest remain to be noted concerning that popular and scathing personage Mr Pasquin

 Content doubtless with the success of Pasquin Fielding does not seem to have launched any further political attacks during the remaining months of 

 To this pleasant picture of rural Amusements and tranquillity it is surely not impertinent to add this further passage as a possible echo of Charlotte Fielding s thought well acquainted as she must have been both with the sweetly winding banks of Stour and with the clamorous successes of political drama in all these various Changes I never enjoyed any real Satisfaction unless in the little time I lived retired in the Country free from all Noise and Hurry

 This view is further supported by the opinion of Mr Austin Dobson that many of the papers signed C

 As regards Ralph s collaboration with Fielding at this period a collaboration further affirmed by Dr Nathan Drake s assertion written in that James Ralph was Fielding s chief coadjutor in that paper it may be recalled that ten years previously this not very reputable American had provided a prologue for Fielding s early play the Temple Beau and that he appears again as Fielding s partner in the management of the Little Theatre in the Haymarket

 But supposition in lack of further evidence is fruitless all that we can clearly perceive is that this winter of sickness and distress marks a final severance from party politics

 And wonder and admiration increase tenfold on the further discovery that this fresh creation in literature fashioned in circumstances so depressing is overflowing with an exuberance of healthy life and enjoyment

 To such distresses of sickness and anxiety there was now doubtless added the further misery of scanty means

 Together with Fielding s natural love for fighting a family tie may have given him a further incitement to draw his pen on behalf of the aged Duchess

 This we learn from his own touching apology for the further delay of those volumes a delay due their author tells us to the dangerous Illness of one from whom I draw all the solid Comfort of my Life during the greatest Part of this Winter

 An underlying attack on the Ministerial iniquity of Great Men in high places seems to be often suggested if this be a true inference it does but give us further proof of Fielding s energies as a political no less than as a moral reformer

 This little pamphlet copies of which may be seen in the British Museum is merely a further vigorous declamation for civil liberty and the Protestant religion as under King George and contains hardly any reference either to Winnington or to the author

 It was retorted on in two further pamphlets

 Her Ladyship adds some further sneers on writers pensioned to amuse people with their nonsense

 Appropriately for a book expressly designed to recommend goodness and innocence the plan of the novel was suggested many years before its appearance by the good Lord Lyttelton and we know further that the writing occupied some thousands of hours but Tom Jones does not emerge into definite existence till the summer of 

 And conscious that wit and humour require a rein quite unneeded by the methods of the professional moralist Fielding further asserts that in these pages his laughter is worthy of the aim which he sets before him

 And no further justification of Fielding s words need be entered than that verdict of the eighteenth century scholar and bishop of the English Church Doctor Warburton when he declared that Mr

 And further Tom Jones not only suffers for his ill doing but wins no heaven until he wholly purges himself from the sin which did so easily beset him

 Here is yet further proof that Fielding loved not only to see the manners of many men but also to render them whatever service lay within his power

 Further he could generally bribe or deter the prosecutor

 The application on behalf of Joshua Brogden later if not at this time the Justice s Clerk recalls the further pleasant tribute paid to the soundness of Mr Brogden s morals in the Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon 

 Moore is writing to a dissenting minister at Taunton one Mr John Ward of whom it was said that venerable as he himself was for learning worth and piety he deemed it an honour to have his name connected with that of Moore a further proof of the quality of man whom Fielding choose for friend

 And if further proof be needed of the conditions of public safety at the beginning of the year it may be seen in the passage of the King s Speech delivered at the opening of Parliament on the th of January in which his Majesty exhorted the Commons to suppress outrages and violences on life and property words representing of course the policy of the Ministry

 A further appreciation of the Examples appears in a paragraph in the Journal for May Last week a certain Colonel of the Army bought a large number of the book called Examples of the Interposition of Providence in the Detection and Punishment of Murder in Order to distribute them amongst the private soldiers of his Regiment

 At present he declares he has No intention to hold any further correspondence with the gayer Muses just as eight years before he had announced that henceforth the infamous Nine should have none of his company

 The name and the further details of the advertisement recall Fielding s early success with his political Pasquin but all further trace of this Satire seems lost

 An issue of warrants followed upon her examination and a further examination of a suspected confederate of the gipsy the gipsy herself and her chief abettor having already been arrested by another magistrate

 The circumstances under which I now meet you will acquit me from entering into that subject further than to refer to the great constitutional charter under which you are assembled and which in defining your powers designates the objects to which your attention is to be given

 On this subject it might become me better to be silent or to speak with diffidence but as something may be expected the occasion I hope will be admitted as an apology if I venture to say that if a preference upon principle of a free republican government formed upon long and serious reflection after a diligent and impartial inquiry after truth if an attachment to the Constitution of the United States and a conscientious determination to support it until it shall be altered by the judgments and wishes of the people expressed in the mode prescribed in it if a respectful attention to the constitutions of the individual States and a constant caution and delicacy toward the State governments if an equal and impartial regard to the rights interest honor and happiness of all the States in the Union without preference or regard to a northern or southern an eastern or western position their various political opinions on unessential points or their personal attachments if a love of virtuous men of all parties and denominations if a love of science and letters and a wish to patronize every rational effort to encourage schools colleges universities academies and every institution for propagating knowledge virtue and religion among all classes of the people not only for their benign influence on the happiness of life in all its stages and classes and of society in all its forms but as the only means of preserving our Constitution from its natural enemies the spirit of sophistry the spirit of party the spirit of intrigue the profligacy of corruption and the pestilence of foreign influence which is the angel of destruction to elective governments if a love of equal laws of justice and humanity in the interior administration if an inclination to improve agriculture commerce and manufacturers for necessity convenience and defense if a spirit of equity and humanity toward the aboriginal nations of America and a disposition to meliorate their condition by inclining them to be more friendly to us and our citizens to be more friendly to them if an inflexible determination to maintain peace and inviolable faith with all nations and that system of neutrality and impartiality among the belligerent powers of Europe which has been adopted by this Government and so solemnly sanctioned by both Houses of Congress and applauded by the legislatures of the States and the public opinion until it shall be otherwise ordained by Congress if a personal esteem for the French nation formed in a residence of seven years chiefly among them and a sincere desire to preserve the friendship which has been so much for the honor and interest of both nations if while the conscious honor and integrity of the people of America and the internal sentiment of their own power and energies must be preserved an earnest endeavor to investigate every just cause and remove every colorable pretense of complaint if an intention to pursue by amicable negotiation a reparation for the injuries that have been committed on the commerce of our fellow citizens by whatever nation and if success can not be obtained to lay the facts before the Legislature that they may consider what further measures the honor and interest of the Government and its constituents demand if a resolution to do justice as far as may depend upon me at all times and to all nations and maintain peace friendship and benevolence with all the world if an unshaken confidence in the honor spirit and resources of the American people on which I have so often hazarded my all and never been deceived if elevated ideas of the high destinies of this country and of my own duties toward it founded on a knowledge of the moral principles and intellectual improvements of the people deeply engraven on my mind in early life and not obscured but exalted by experience and age and with humble reverence I feel it to be my duty to add if a veneration for the religion of a people who profess and call themselves Christians and a fixed resolution to consider a decent respect for Christianity among the best recommendations for the public service can enable me in any degree to comply with your wishes it shall be my strenuous endeavor that this sagacious injunction of the two Houses shall not be without effect

 And now we find them in further contempt of the modes of honorable warfare supplying the place of a conquering force by attempts to disorganize our political society to dismember our confederated Republic

 If the person thus elected has served the preceding term an opportunity is afforded him to review its principal occurrences and to give such further explanation respecting them as in his judgment may be useful to his constituents

 With this view after reducing our land force to the basis of a peace establishment which has been further modified since provision was made for the construction of fortifications at proper points through the whole extent of our coast and such an augmentation of our naval force as should be well adapted to both purposes

 The full benefit of example being secured policy as well as humanity equally forbids that they should be carried further

 Under the pledge of these promises made by that eminent citizen at the time of his first induction to this office in his career of eight years the internal taxes have been repealed sixty millions of the public debt have been discharged provision has been made for the comfort and relief of the aged and indigent among the surviving warriors of the Revolution the regular armed force has been reduced and its constitution revised and perfected the accountability for the expenditure of public moneys has been made more effective the Floridas have been peaceably acquired and our boundary has been extended to the Pacific Ocean the independence of the southern nations of this hemisphere has been recognized and recommended by example and by counsel to the potentates of Europe progress has been made in the defense of the country by fortifications and the increase of the Navy toward the effectual suppression of the African traffic in slaves in alluring the aboriginal hunters of our land to the cultivation of the soil and of the mind in exploring the interior regions of the Union and in preparing by scientific researches and surveys for the further application of our national resources to the internal improvement of our country

 To enter on this occasion into a further or more minute exposition of my views on the various questions of domestic policy would be as obtrusive as it is probably unexpected

 Jefferson forbidding their interference in elections further than giving their own votes and their own independence secured by an assurance of perfect immunity in exercising this sacred privilege of freemen under the dictates of their own unbiased judgments

 For similar reasons the mode of keeping the public treasure should be prescribed by them and the further removed it may be from the control of the Executive the more wholesome the arrangement and the more in accordance with republican principle

 Acting on this principle no nation will have a right to interfere or to complain if in the progress of events we shall still further extend our possessions

 It was further matured and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual by the Articles of Confederation in 

 I acknowledge before this assemblage representing as it does every section of our country the obligation I am under to my countrymen for the great honor they have conferred on me by returning me to the highest office within their gift and the further obligation resting on me to render to them the best services within my power

 Sacredly preserving whatever has been gained to liberty and good government during the century our people are determined to leave behind them all those bitter controversies concerning things which have been irrevocably settled and the further discussion of which can only stir up strife and delay the onward march

 Those who have been for years calling attention to the pressing necessity of throwing about the ballot box and about the elector further safeguards in order that our elections might not only be free and pure but might clearly appear to be so will welcome the accession of any who did not so soon discover the need of reform

 The benefits already gained through this instrumentality and the further usefulness it promises entitle it to the hearty support and encouragement of all who desire to see our public service well performed or who hope for the elevation of political sentiment and the purification of political methods

 Our financial system needs some revision our money is all good now but its value must not further be threatened

 The brief trial given this legislation amply justifies a further experiment and additional discretionary power in the making of commercial treaties the end in view always to be the opening up of new markets for the products of our country by granting concessions to the products of other lands that we need and cannot produce ourselves and which do not involve any loss of labor to our own people but tend to increase their employment

 Our naturalization and immigration laws should be further improved to the constant promotion of a safer a better and a higher citizenship

 Our fellow citizens who may disagree with us upon the character of this legislation prefer to have the question settled now even against their preconceived views and perhaps settled so reasonably as I trust and believe it will be as to insure great permanence than to have further uncertainty menacing the vast and varied business interests of the United States

 Our diversified productions however are increasing in such unprecedented volume as to admonish us of the necessity of still further enlarging our foreign markets by broader commercial relations

 May it end without further bloodshed and there be ushered in the reign of peace to be made permanent by a government of liberty under law INAUGURAL ADDRESSES OF THE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES Theodore Roosevelt INAUGURAL ADDRESS SATURDAY MARCH The energetic Republican President had taken his first oath of office upon the death of President McKinley who died of an assassin s gunshot wounds on September 

 To render the reforms lasting however and to secure at the same time freedom from alarm on the part of those pursuing proper and progressive business methods further legislative and executive action are needed

 I wish to say that insofar as I can I hope to promote the enactment of further legislation of this character

 The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction when unless we wish to hamper the people in their right to earn a living we must have tax reform

 COOPERATION BY THE GOVERNMENT The larger purpose of our economic thought should be to establish more firmly stability and security of business and employment and thereby remove poverty still further from our borders

 We have need further to perfect the means by which Government can be adapted to human service

 I covet for this administration a record of having further contributed to advance the cause of peace

 SPECIAL SESSION OF THE CONGRESS Action upon some of the proposals upon which the Republican Party was returned to power particularly further agricultural relief and limited changes in the tariff cannot in justice to our farmers our labor and our manufacturers be postponed

 OTHER MANDATES FROM THE ELECTION It appears to me that the more important further mandates from the recent election were the maintenance of the integrity of the Constitution the vigorous enforcement of the laws the continuance of economy in public expenditure the continued regulation of business to prevent domination in the community the denial of ownership or operation of business by the Government in competition with its citizens the avoidance of policies which would involve us in the controversies of foreign nations the more effective reorganization of the departments of the Federal Government the expansion of public works and the promotion of welfare activities affecting education and the home

 We do know what the attainments of these ideals should be The preservation of self government and its full foundations in local government the perfection of justice whether in economic or in social fields the maintenance of ordered liberty the denial of domination by any group or class the building up and preservation of equality of opportunity the stimulation of initiative and individuality absolute integrity in public affairs the choice of officials for fitness to office the direction of economic progress toward prosperity for the further lessening of poverty the freedom of public opinion the sustaining of education and of the advancement of knowledge the growth of religious spirit and the tolerance of all faiths the strengthening of the home the advancement of peace

 Beyond that we must take further steps to permanently control Government s power to tax and spend

 We are not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear weapons

 But it would be superfluous here to give further details on the correspondence between man and the higher mammals in the structure of the brain and all other parts of the body

 Nascent organs on the other hand though not fully developed are of high service to their possessors and are capable of further development

 It is evident that the folding over of the tip of such an ear unless it changed greatly during its further development would give rise to a point projecting inwards

 From this astonishing number of observations it is proved that local influences of some kind act directly on stature and we further learn that the State where the physical growth has in great measure taken place and the State of birth which indicates the ancestry seem to exert a marked influence on the stature

 Beddoe further believes that wherever a race attains its maximum of physical development it rises highest in energy and moral vigour

 To throw a stone with as true an aim as a Fuegian in defending himself or in killing birds requires the most consummate perfection in the correlated action of the muscles of the hand arm and shoulder and further a fine sense of touch

 winged two wild ducks which fell on the further side of a stream his retriever tried to bring over both at once but could not succeed she then though never before known to ruffle a feather deliberately killed one brought over the other and returned for the dead bird

 This difficulty arises from the impossibility of judging what passes through the mind of an animal and again the fact that writers differ to a great extent in the meaning which they attribute to the above terms causes a further difficulty

 He observes that the desire of communication between man is the living force which in the development of language works both consciously and unconsciously consciously as regards the immediate end to be attained unconsciously as regards the further consequences of the act

 As all the higher mammals possess vocal organs constructed on the same general plan as ours and used as a means of communication it was obviously probable that these same organs would be still further developed if the power of communication had to be improved and this has been effected by the aid of adjoining and well adapted parts namely the tongue and lips

 But we can trace the formation of many words further back than that of species for we can perceive how they actually arose from the imitation of various sounds

 For further facts see Sir J

 He then further shews that names or nicknames given from some animal or other object to the early progenitors or founders of a tribe are supposed after a long interval to represent the real progenitor of the tribe and such animal or object is then naturally believed still to exist as a spirit is held sacred and worshipped as a god

 Why then does man regret even though trying to banish such regret that he has followed the one natural impulse rather than the other and why does he further feel that he ought to regret his conduct Man in this respect differs profoundly from the lower animals

 As a tribe increases and is victorious it is often still further increased by the absorption of other tribes

 This view has not been accepted as far as I am aware by any naturalist capable of forming an independent judgment and therefore need not here be further considered

 We can further see why a great amount of modification in some one character ought not to lead us to separate widely any two organisms

 A part which already differs much from the same part in other allied forms has already according to the theory of evolution varied much consequently it would as long as the organism remained exposed to the same exciting conditions be liable to further variations of the same kind and these if beneficial would be preserved and thus be continually augmented

 Kovalevsky writes to me from Naples that he has now carried these observations yet further and should his results be well established the whole will form a discovery of the very greatest value

 Vogt thinks that the subject requires further investigation

 Lubbock further remarks how improbable it is that our earliest ancestors could have counted as high as ten considering that so many races now in existence cannot get beyond four

 It further appears mysterious as is the fact that the first meeting of distinct and separated people generates disease

 He adduces as a further cause of the decrease the inequality of the sexes for fewer females are born than males

 There is moreover a further resemblance to the case of New Zealand in the fact that there is a large excess of male over female births the census of gives males to females of all ages that is 

 He further states that the inhabitants of the Valley of Nepal which is extremely hot in summer and also the various hill tribes of India suffer from dysentery and fever when on the plains and they die if they attempt to pass the whole year there

 It can further be shewn that the differences between the races of man as in colour hairiness form of features etc

 It is further established that the degree of asymmetry of the convolution of the two sides in the human brain is subject to much individual variation and that in those individuals of the Bushman race who have been examined the gyri and sulci of the two hemispheres are considerably less complicated and more symmetrical than in the European brain while in some individuals of the chimpanzee their complexity and asymmetry become notable

 It is quite correct to say that a frog passes through the condition of a fish inasmuch as at one period of its life the tadpole has all the characters of a fish and if it went no further would have to be grouped among fishes

 We shall further see and it could never have been anticipated that the power to charm the female has sometimes been more important than the power to conquer other males in battle

 Wallace further remarks that female caterpillars from being larger than the males require more time for their development and consume more food and moisture and thus they would be exposed during a longer time to danger from ichneumons birds etc

 He further believes that the luminous species profit by being at once recognised as unpalatable

 Gruber further shews that their development is in part directly due to the stimulus from the friction of one wing over the other

 In the males on the other hand they become further developed and acquire their perfect structure at the last moult when the insect is mature and ready to breed

 thought that he had at last discovered a species in which the horns did not vary but further research proved the contrary

 Bates further observed that the imitating species are comparatively rare whilst the imitated abound and that the two sets live mingled together

 Whatever explanation applies to the one class probably applies to the other and this explanation as we shall hereafter attempt to shew in further detail is sexual selection

 With the various species of Chromids as Professor Agassiz likewise informs me sexual differences in colour may be observed whether they lay their eggs in the water among aquatic plants or deposit them in holes leaving them to come out without further care or build shallow nests in the river mud over which they sit as our Pomotis does

 It is further manifest in all the cases in which the males take exclusive charge of the nests and young that the destruction of the brighter coloured males would be far more influential on the character of the race than the destruction of the brighter coloured females for the death of the male during the period of incubation or nursing would entail the death of the young so that they could not inherit his peculiarities yet in many of these very cases the males are more conspicuously coloured than the females

 gives some further particulars on the sounds made by fishes

 and for further particulars Capt

 give to their tail feathers the racket shape by biting off the barbs and further that this continued mutilation has produced a certain amount of inherited effect

 By a little further acceleration in the process the double moult would be completely lost

 From the foregoing facts we clearly see that the plumes and other ornaments of the males must be of the highest importance to them and we further see that beauty is even sometimes more important than success in battle

 Before we further discuss the question whether the females select the more attractive males or accept the first whom they may encounter it will be advisable briefly to consider the mental powers of birds

 By what further steps the more complex ocelli which are surrounded by many successive zones of colour have been generated I will not pretend to say

 Ward of a specimen mounted as in the act of display it may be seen that on the feathers which are held perpendicularly the white marks on the ocelli representing light reflected from a convex surface are at the upper or further end that is are directed upwards and the bird whilst displaying himself on the ground would naturally be illuminated from above

 Nevertheless they are not illuminated from strictly the same point as they ought to be for the white marks on the ocelli of the feathers which are held almost horizontally are placed rather too much towards the further end that is they are not sufficiently lateral

 It was further shewn that if a male bird varied by becoming brighter whilst young such variations would be of no service until the age for reproduction had arrived and there was competition between rival males

 But it will be convenient to defer any further discussion on this subject until I treat in the following chapter of the differences in plumage between the young and old

 If so we may further infer that nearly similar plumage of the female black grouse was similarly produced at some former period

 But if we could look still further back to the still earlier progenitors of these two species we should probably see the adults dark coloured

 for further facts on negro infants as quoted from Winterbottom and Camper see Lawrence Lectures on Physiology etc

 But if it be further asked why musical tones in a certain order and rhythm give man and other animals pleasure we can no more give the reason than for the pleasantness of certain tastes and smells

 We may go even further than this and as remarked in a former chapter believe that musical sounds afforded one of the bases for the development of language

 Further south the Batokas knock out only the two upper incisors which as Livingstone 

 Further south with the Makalolo the upper lip is perforated and a large metal and bamboo ring called a pelele is worn in the hole

 Lubbock further gives a curious body of facts shewing that in old times high honour was bestowed on women who were utterly licentious and this as he explains is intelligible if we admit that promiscuous intercourse was the aboriginal and therefore long revered custom of the tribe

 Further evidence could be given of the inheritance of the effects of mutilations but a fact lately ascertained by Mr

 Some of these such as the Negro and European are so distinct that if specimens had been brought to a naturalist without any further information they would undoubtedly have been considered by him as good and true species

 At the same hour departed the good man Gallet and having passed the ford asked at the miller that dwelt there in what condition Picrochole was who answered him that his soldiers had left him neither cock nor hen that they were retired and shut up into the rock Clermond and that he would not advise him to go any further for fear of the scouts because they were enormously furious

 Touchfaucet immediately after his return presented himself before Picrochole and related unto him at large all that he had done and seen and at last endeavoured to persuade him with strong and forcible arguments to capitulate and make an agreement with Grangousier whom he found to be the honestest man in the world saying further that it was neither right nor reason thus to trouble his neighbours of whom they had never received anything but good

 The great wit and judgment of Pantagruel was immediately after this made known unto all the world by setting forth his praises in print and putting upon record this late wonderful proof he hath given thereof amongst the rolls of the crown and registers of the palace in such sort that everybody began to say that Solomon who by a probable guess only without any further certainty caused the child to be delivered to its own mother showed never in his time such a masterpiece of wisdom as the good Pantagruel hath done

 But before we proceed any further in this purpose I will tell you how Panurge handled his prisoner the King Anarchus for having remembered that which Epistemon had related how the kings and rich men in this world were used in the Elysian fields and how they got their living there by base and ignoble trades he therefore one day apparelled his king in a pretty little canvas doublet all jagged and pinked like the tippet of a light horseman s cap together with a pair of large mariner s breeches and stockings without shoes For said he they would but spoil his sight and a little peach coloured bonnet with a great capon s feather in it I lie for I think he had two and a very handsome girdle of a sky colour and green in French called pers et vert saying that such a livery did become him well for that he had always been perverse and in this plight bringing him before Pantagruel said unto him Do you know this roister No indeed said Pantagruel

 For nature might have placed our heads in our knees or elbows but having beforehand determined that the eyes should serve to discover things from afar she for the better enabling them to execute their designed office fixed them in the head as on the top of a long pole in the most eminent part of all the body no otherwise than we see the phares or high towers erected in the mouths of havens that navigators may the further off perceive with ease the lights of the nightly fires and lanterns

 Thereafter did he make in this posture his hand by little and little and by degrees and pauses successively to mount from athwart the belly to the stomach from whence he made it to ascend to the breast even upwards to Panurge s neck still gaining ground till having reached his chin he had put within the concave of his mouth his afore mentioned thumb then fiercely brandishing the whole hand which he made to rub and grate against his nose he heaved it further up and made the fashion as if with the thumb thereof he would have put out his eyes

 For as when being upon a pier by the shore we see afar off mariners seafaring men and other travellers alongst the curled waves of azure Thetis within their ships we then consider them in silence only and seldom proceed any further than to wish them a happy and prosperous arrival but when they do approach near to haven and come to wet their keels within their harbour then both with words and gestures we salute them and heartily congratulate their access safe to the port wherein we are ourselves

 After which time it lay not in the power of them all to draw out of his chaps the articulate sound of one syllable insomuch that when Panurge went about to interrogate him further Triboulet drew his wooden sword and would have stuck him therewith

 Others again of that parental relation have upon the reception of the like injury been of a more magnanimous and heroic spirit who in imitation and at the example of the children of Jacob revenging upon the Sichemites the rapt of their sister Dinah having found the rascally ruffian in the association of his mystical mole catcher closely and in hugger mugger conferring parleying and coming with their daughters for the suborning corrupting depraving perverting and enticing these innocent unexperienced maids unto filthy lewdnesses have without any further advisement on the matter cut them instantly into pieces and thereupon forthwith thrown out upon the fields their so dismembered bodies to serve for food unto the wolves and ravens

 What wonder is it then Or how little strange should it appear to any rational man if a lechering rogue together with his mole catching abettor be entrapped in the flagrant act of suborning his daughter and stealing her out of his house though herself consent thereto that the father in such a case of stain and infamy by them brought upon his family should put them both to a shameful death and cast their carcasses upon dunghills to be devoured and eaten up by dogs and swine or otherwise fling them a little further off to the direption tearing and rending asunder of their joints and members by the wild beasts of the field as unworthy to receive the gentle the desired the last kind embraces of the great Alma Mater the earth commonly called burial 

 I will proceed yet further

 This child s presence called up both in Vronsky and in Anna a feeling akin to the feeling of a sailor who sees by the compass that the direction in which he is swiftly moving is far from the right one but that to arrest his motion is not in his power that every instant is carrying him further and further away and that to admit to himself his deviation from the right direction is the same as admitting his certain ruin

 Joe throwing the door wide open and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and applied Tickler to its further investigation

 Of course I made no further effort to refer to it

 In effect we had not walked many yards further when the well remembered boom came towards us deadened by the mist and heavily rolled away along the low grounds by the river as if it were pursuing and threatening the fugitives

 Further one of those two was already retaken and had not freed himself of his iron

 In addition to the dread that having led up to so much mischief it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me if he believed it I had a further restraining dread that he would not believe it but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal cutlets as a monstrous invention

 Have you heard Joe I asked him that evening upon further consideration as he smoked his pipe at the window who my patron was I heerd returned Joe as it were not Miss Havisham old chap

 The last word grated on me but how could I remonstrate I walked no further than the gate of the gardens and then pretended to be weaker than I was and asked Joe for his arm

 To enter on this occasion into a further or more minute exposition of my views on the various questions of domestic policy would be as obtrusive as it is probably unexpected

 Sacredly preserving whatever has been gained to liberty and good government during the century our people are determined to leave behind them all those bitter controversies concerning things which have been irrevocably settled and the further discussion of which can only stir up strife and delay the onward march

 Those who have been for years calling attention to the pressing necessity of throwing about the ballot box and about the elector further safeguards in order that our elections might not only be free and pure but might clearly appear to be so will welcome the accession of any who did not so soon discover the need of reform

 The brief trial given this legislation amply justifies a further experiment and additional discretionary power in the making of commercial treaties the end in view always to be the opening up of new markets for the products of our country by granting concessions to the products of other lands that we need and cannot produce ourselves and which do not involve any loss of labor to our own people but tend to increase their employment

 Our naturalization and immigration laws should be further improved to the constant promotion of a safer a better and a higher citizenship

 Our fellow citizens who may disagree with us upon the character of this legislation prefer to have the question settled now even against their preconceived views and perhaps settled so reasonably as I trust and believe it will be as to insure great permanence than to have further uncertainty menacing the vast and varied business interests of the United States

 Pasias entering with his summons witness Then ought a man to throw away any part of his own property Never But it were better then at once to put away blushes rather than now to have trouble since I am now dragging you to be a witness for the sake of my own money and further in addition to this I shall become an enemy to my fellow tribesman

 In his deposition already referred to he says It was not convenient that this book should become public during her lifetime but rather that it should be kept at the Holy Office the Inquisition until we knew the end of this person it was therefore quite against my will that some copies were taken while it was in the hands of the bishop Don Alvaro Mendoza who being a powerful prelate and having received it from the said Teresa of Jesus allowed it to be copied and showed it to his sister do a Maria de Mendoza thus certain persons taking an interest in spiritual matters and knowing already some portions of this treatise evidently the contents of the divulged Relations made further copies one of which became the property of the Duchess of Alba do a Maria Enriquez and is now I think in the hands of her daughter in law do a Maria de Toledo

 How she was commanded to have nothing further to do with it how she abandoned it also the troubles it brought her and how God consoled her in all this

 Under his direction she made great progress and for the further satisfaction of her confessor and of Don Francis who seems to have still retained some of his doubts she told everything to St

 I procured further information about the matter from members of his household I learned more of his ruinous state and saw that the poor man s fault was not so grave because the miserable woman had had recourse to enchantments by giving him a little image made of copper which she had begged him to wear for love of her around his neck and this no one had influence enough to persuade him to throw away

 The humility of your reverence willing to be helped by a simplicity so great as mine has been the cause I believe why our Lord to day after Communion admitted me to this state of prayer without the power of going further and suggested to me these comparisons and taught me how to speak of it and of what the soul must do therein

 You my father will be delighted greatly if our Lord should bestow them all upon you if you have them not already to find an account of the matter in writing and to understand it for it is one grace that our Lord gives grace and it is another grace to understand what grace and what gift it is and it is another and further grace to have the power to describe and explain it to others

 I know not how this can be but so it is it comes from the hand of our Lord and as I said before is not anything that I have acquired myself because it is exceedingly supernatural and I think I would not barter it for all the graces of which I shall speak further on I do not say for all of them together but for any one of them separately

 I can well believe that he who has attained to union and advances no further that is to raptures visions and other graces of God given to souls will consider that opinion to be best as I did myself and if I had continued in it I believe I should never have reached the state I am in now

 I believe myself that this is the reason why so many souls after advancing to the prayer of union make no further progress and do not attain to very great liberty of spirit

 He went further for he seems to have prophesied of that which our Lord afterwards did with me and said that I should be very much to blame if I did not correspond with the graces which God bestowed upon me

 What a grand thing it is to understand a soul He told me to make my prayer every day on some mystery of the Passion and that I should profit by it and to fix my thoughts on the Sacred Humanity only resisting to the utmost of my power those recollections and delights to which I was not to yield in any way till he gave me further directions in the matter

 He said that further resistance would be a mistake

 Accordingly there was no necessity for laying further commands upon me in this matter

 I should like to explain also how those locutions which come from the Good Spirit differ from those which come from an evil spirit and further how they may be but an apprehension of the understanding for that is possible or even words which the mind addressed to itself

 I look upon it as a most certain truth that the devil will never deceive and that God will not suffer him to deceive the soul which has no confidence whatever in itself which is strong in faith and resolved to undergo a thousand deaths for any one article of the creed which in its love of the faith infused of God once for all a faith living and strong always labours seeking for further light on this side and on that to mould itself on the teaching of the Church as one already deeply grounded in the truth

 Francis de Borja to make no further resistance Bouix 

 As for myself though as I said it seemed to me impossible that the work should be finally abandoned yet my belief in the truth of the revelation went no further than in so far as it was not against what is contained in the sacred writings nor against the laws of the Church which we are bound to keep

 His Majesty further showing His great love for me said to me very often Thou art Mine and I am thine

 This is clearly the best way we need not go up to heaven nor any further than our own selves for that would only distress the spirit and distract the soul and bring but little fruit

 It was natural therefore that Huseyn should seek further information and guidance from Ali Muhammad himself

 No sooner had he beheld and conversed with the Bab than because of the purity of his heart he at once believed without seeking further sign or proof

 It is further stated that in the list of the nineteen Letters of the Living Kuddus stood next to the Bab himself and the reader has seen how in the defence of Tabarsi Kuddus took precedence even of that gallant knight known among the Babis as the Gate s Gate

 He further said I will look out for some good berth for you

 But having no means to send him any word or to hear further of him we were very sad

 I was aware that the languages taught in them are necessary to the understanding of the writings of the ancients that the grace of fable stirs the mind that the memorable deeds of history elevate it and if read with discretion aid in forming the judgment that the perusal of all excellent books is as it were to interview with the noblest men of past ages who have written them and even a studied interview in which are discovered to us only their choicest thoughts that eloquence has incomparable force and beauty that poesy has its ravishing graces and delights that in the mathematics there are many refined discoveries eminently suited to gratify the inquisitive as well as further all the arts an lessen the labour of man that numerous highly useful precepts and exhortations to virtue are contained in treatises on morals that theology points out the path to heaven that philosophy affords the means of discoursing with an appearance of truth on all matters and commands the admiration of the more simple that jurisprudence medicine and the other sciences secure for their cultivators honors and riches and in fine that it is useful to bestow some attention upon all even upon those abounding the most in superstition and error that we may be in a position to determine their real value and guard against being deceived

 Of philosophy I will say nothing except that when I saw that it had been cultivated for many ages by the most distinguished men and that yet there is not a single matter within its sphere which is not still in dispute and nothing therefore which is above doubt I did not presume to anticipate that my success would be greater in it than that of others and further when I considered the number of conflicting opinions touching a single matter that may be upheld by learned men while there can be but one true I reckoned as well nigh false all that was only probable

 Perceiving further that in order to understand these relations I should sometimes have to consider them one by one and sometimes only to bear them in mind or embrace them in the aggregate I thought that in order the better to consider them individually I should view them as subsisting between straight lines than which I could find no objects more simple or capable of being more distinctly represented to my imagination and senses and on the other hand that in order to retain them in the memory or embrace an aggregate of many I should express them by certain characters the briefest possible

 And further I continued to exercise myself in the method I had prescribed for besides taking care in general to conduct all my thoughts according to its rules I reserved some hours from time to time which I expressly devoted to the employment of the method in the solution of mathematical difficulties or even in the solution likewise of some questions belonging to other sciences but which by my having detached them from such principles of these sciences as were of inadequate certainty were rendered almost mathematical the truth of this will be manifest from the numerous examples contained in this volume

 And because our reasonings are never so clear or so complete during sleep as when we are awake although sometimes the acts of our imagination are then as lively and distinct if not more so than in our waking moments reason further dictates that since all our thoughts cannot be true because of our partial imperfection those possessing truth must infallibly be found in the experience of our waking moments rather than in that of our dreams

 Further to enable me to cast this variety of subjects somewhat into the shade and to express my judgment regarding them with greater freedom without being necessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned I resolved to leave all the people here to their disputes and to speak only of what would happen in a new world if God were now to create somewhere in the imaginary spaces matter sufficient to compose one and were to agitate variously and confusedly the different parts of this matter so that there resulted a chaos as disordered as the poets ever feigned and after that did nothing more than lend his ordinary concurrence to nature and allow her to act in accordance with the laws which he had established

 I will not hesitate even to avow my belief that nothing further is wanting to enable me fully to realize my designs than to gain two or three similar victories and that I am not so far advanced in years but that according to the ordinary course of nature I may still have sufficient leisure for this end

 And further I have never observed that any truth before unknown has been brought to light by the disputations that are practised in the schools for while each strives for the victory each is much more occupied in making the best of mere verisimilitude than in weighing the reasons on both sides of the question and those who have been long good advocates are not afterwards on that account the better judges

 Clay would have been to prevent the extension of slavery could the act of electing have been evil But I will not argue further

 That report had met with the approbation of all the Whigs and of all the Democrats also with the exception of one and he wanted to go even further than this

 He considers himself as restricted by law to this amount and he says further that he would not give more if he could because in his apprehension it would not be fair and just

 The result of this examination was to make the impression that taking for true all the President states as facts he falls far short of proving his justification and that the President would have gone further with his proof if it had not been for the small matter that the truth would not permit him

 A further deception is that it will let in evidence which a true issue would exclude

 Before going further consider well whether this is or is not your position

 New provisions would introduce new difficulties and thus create and increase appetite for further change

 Now everybody knew that it was not the habit of the district judges of the United States in other States to hold anything like that number of courts and he therefore took it for granted that this must happen under a peculiar law which required that large number of courts to be holden every year and these laws he further supposed were passed at the request of the people of that judicial district

 I should do so because in my judgment his election alone can defeat General Cass and because should slavery thereby go to the territory we now have just so much will certainly happen by the election of Cass and in addition a course of policy leading to new wars new acquisitions of territory and still further extensions of slavery

 To return I cannot help believing that General Cass when he wrote his letter of acceptance well understood he was to be claimed by the advocates of both sides of this question and that he then closed the door against all further expressions of opinion purposely to retain the benefits of that double position

 But the gentleman from Georgia further says we have deserted all our principles and taken shelter under General Taylor s military coat tail and he seems to think this is exceedingly degrading

 He sought to be in advance and to avoid the uninteresting position of a mere follower but soon he began to see glimpses of the great Democratic ox goad waving in his face and to hear indistinctly a voice saying Back Back sir Back a little He shakes his head and bats his eyes and blunders back to his position of March but still the goad waves and the voice grows more distinct and sharper still Back sir Back I say Further back and back he goes to the position of December at which the goad is still and the voice soothingly says So Stand at that Have no fears gentlemen of your candidate

 That all persons now within this District lawfully held as slaves or now owned by any person or persons now resident within said District shall remain such at the will of their respective owners their heirs and legal representatives Provided That such owner or his legal representative may at any time receive from the Treasury of the United States the full value of his or her slave of the class in this section mentioned upon which such slave shall be forthwith and forever free And provided further That the President of the United States the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury shall be a board for determining the value of such slaves as their owners may desire to emancipate under this section and whose duty it shall be to hold a session for the purpose on the first Monday of each calendar month to receive all applications and on satisfactory evidence in each case that the person presented for valuation is a slave and of the class in this section mentioned and is owned by the applicant shall value such slave at his or her full cash value and give to the applicant an order on the Treasury for the amount and also to such slave a certificate of freedom

 Your Petitioner further states that the reasons of his not being present at said trial as he was not and of its not being in his power to take an appeal in the ordinary way as it was not were that your Petitioner then resided in Edgar County about one hundred and twenty miles from where defendants resided that a very short time before the suit was commenced your Petitioner was in Sangamon County for the purpose of collecting debts due him and with the rest the note in question which note had then been given more than a year that your Petitioner then saw the defendant J

 I wish further to say that I do not propose to question the patriotism or to assail the motives of any man or class of men but rather to confine myself strictly to the naked merits of the question

 Did they then could they establish a principle contrary to their own intention Still further if they intended to establish the principle that whenever Congress had control it should be left to the people to do as they thought fit with slavery why did they not authorize the people of the District of Columbia at their option to abolish slavery within their limits I personally know that this has not been left undone because it was unthought of

 Still further there are constitutional relations between the slave and free States which are degrading to the latter

 Upon this state of facts the people framed their constitution prohibiting the further introduction of slavery with a sort of guaranty to the owners of the few indentured servants giving freedom to their children to be born thereafter and making no mention whatever of any supposed slave for life

 The Washington act goes even further it absolutely prohibits the territorial Legislature by very strong and guarded language from establishing banks or borrowing money on the faith of the Territory

 It was part of the bargain and I m for living up to it but I go no further I m not bound to do more and I won t agree any further

 But if this thing is allowed to continue it will be but one step further to impress the same rule in Illinois

 We must reinstate the birthday promise of the Republic we must reaffirm the Declaration of Independence we must make good in essence as well as in form Madison s avowal that the word slave ought not to appear in the Constitution and we must even go further and decree that only local law and not that time honored instrument shall shelter a slaveholder

 You further charge us with being disunionists

 You do not pretend that it ought to dissolve the Union and the facts show that it won t therefore the charge may be dismissed without further consideration

 If as between Fremont and Buchanan you really prefer the election of Buchanan then burn this without reading a line further

 By much dragging of chestnuts from the fire for others to eat his claws are burnt off to the gristle and he is thrown aside as unfit for further use

 But hear General Jackson further If the opinion of the Supreme Court covered the whole ground of this act it ought not to control the coordinate authorities of this government

 but so far as I know the practice has been to hand over to the successor and to cease to do anything further whatever in perfect analogo to Sections and and I have supposed and do suppose this is the law

 About the st of May the d infantry was ordered from Jefferson Barracks to Louisiana to go into camp in the neighborhood of Fort Jessup and there await further orders

 Our orders required us to go into camp in the same neighborhood and await further instructions

 The th infantry went into camp at Salubrity in the month of May with instructions as I have said to await further orders

 As summer wore away and cool days and colder nights came upon us the tents We were occupying ceased to afford comfortable quarters and further orders not reaching us we began to look about to remedy the hardship

 When the news reached us we began to look again for further orders

 We reached there before the middle of the month and again waited weeks for still further orders

 Between the Rio Grande and the Nueces there was at that time a large band of wild horses feeding as numerous probably as the band of buffalo roaming further north was before its rapid extermination commenced

 General Taylor was opposed to anything like plundering by the troops and in this instance I doubt not he looked upon the enemy as the aggrieved party and was not willing to injure them further than his instructions from Washington demanded

 With all this the fort was not completed until the supplies grew so short that further delay in obtaining more could not be thought of

 There was no further resistance

 He felt his responsibility as going no further

 With this road in our possession the enemy would be cut off from receiving further supplies if not from all communication with the interior

 This stopped all further hostilities

 It is not likely that he would have gone as far north as Monterey to attack the United States troops when he knew his country was threatened with invasion further south

 Had the battle of Buena Vista not been fought Santa Anna would have had time to move leisurely to meet the invader further south and with an army not demoralized nor depleted by defeat

 Under these circumstances General Scott directed the holding of the front of the enemy without making an attack until further orders

 The enemy outside the city outnumbered our soldiery quite three to one but they had become so demoralized by the succession of defeats this day that the City of Mexico could have been entered without much further bloodshed

 Had this victory been followed up promptly no doubt Americans and Mexicans would have gone over the defences of Chapultepec so near together that the place would have fallen into our hands without further loss

 The bombardment commenced early on the morning of the th but there was no further engagement during this day than that of the artillery

 On the other hand General Taylor s I think indicate that he considered the administration accountable for the war and felt no responsibility resting on himself further than for the faithful performance of his duties

 We had proceeded but a few miles when we were stopped as before by a guard and notified that the terms of the existing armistice did not permit us to go further in that direction

 From there passengers were carried by boats to Gorgona at which place they took mules for Panama some twenty five miles further

 As the city grew the sand hills back of the town furnished material for filling up the bay under the houses and streets and still further out

 The passage of that bill and my promotion blasted my last hope of ever becoming a citizen of the further West

 A law was enacted authorizing the governor to accept the services of ten additional regiments one from each congressional district for one month to be paid by the State but pledged to go into the service of the United States if there should be a further call during their term

 But the question was soon settled and we had no further trouble

 General Hardee the author of the tactics I did not study was at Greenville some twenty five miles further south it was said with five thousand Confederate troops

 The movement against the rebels at Greenville went no further

 But my campaigns had not yet begun for while seated at my office door with nothing further to do until it was time to start for the front I saw an officer of rank approaching who proved to be Colonel Jefferson C

 Not having received an answer to my first dispatch I again telegraphed to department headquarters that I should start for Paducah that night unless I received further orders

 Smith to move all the troops he could spare from Paducah directly against Columbus halting them however a few miles from the town to await further orders from me

 I learned later when I had moved further south that Belmont had caused more mourning than almost any other battle up to that time

 During the th and th and until the arrival of Wallace and Thayer on the th the National forces composed of but men without intrenchments confronted an intrenched army of without conflict further than what was brought on by ourselves

 The leading boat got within a very short distance of the water battery not further off I think than two hundred yards and I soon saw one and then another of them dropping down the river visibly disabled

 I directed my adjutant general to notify each of the division commanders of my absence and instruct them to do nothing to bring on an engagement until they received further orders but to hold their positions

 He was further unfitted for command for the reason that his conscience must have troubled him and made him afraid

 I turned over the command as directed and then replied to General Halleck courteously but asked to be relieved from further duty under him

 Pittsburg is only about twenty miles from Corinth and Hamburg landing four miles further up the river is a mile or two nearer

 The skirmishing in our front however had been so continuous from about the d of April that I did not leave Pittsburg each night until an hour when I felt there would be no further danger before the morning

 I never could see and do not now see why any order was necessary further than to direct him to come to Pittsburg landing without specifying by what route

 The gunboats Tyler and Lexington Gwin and Shirk commanding with the artillery under Webster aided the army and effectually checked their further progress

 On the Union side but few of the stragglers fell back further than the landing on the river and many of these were in line for duty on the second day

 I myself made no report to General Halleck further than was contained in a letter written immediately after the battle informing him that an engagement had been fought and announcing the result

 He asked to be relieved from further duty in the capacity in which he was engaged and his request was granted

 I was much concerned because my first duty after holding the territory acquired within my command was to prevent further reinforcing of Bragg in Middle Tennessee

 A small force was to hold the Jacinto road where it turns to the north east while the main force moved on the Fulton road which comes into Iuka further east

 He followed only a few miles after I left him and then went into camp and the pursuit was continued no further

 The battle relieved me from any further anxiety for the safety of the territory within my jurisdiction and soon after receiving reinforcements I suggested to the general in chief a forward movement against Vicksburg

 Further reinforcements he knew were on their way from the north to Memphis

 Neither my orders to General Sherman nor the correspondence between us or between General Halleck and myself contemplated at the time my going further south than the Yallabusha

 The further north the enemy could be held the better

 The troops therefore could render no assistance towards an assault further than to establish a battery on a little piece of ground which was discovered above water

 The upper end of these bayous being cut off from a water supply further than the rainfall back of the levees was grown up with dense timber for a distance of several miles from their source

 One small steamer and some barges were got through this channel but no further use could be made of it because of the fall in the river

 The war had suspended peaceful pursuits in the South further than the production of army supplies and in consequence the levees were neglected and broken in many places and the whole country was covered with water

 On the th of May I was further reinforced by Sherman with two divisions of his the th corps

 We were soon in the town and I was delighted to find that the enemy had not stopped to contest our crossing further at the bridge which he had burned

 Smith happened to have an extra horse at Bruinsburg which I borrowed with a saddle tree without upholstering further than stirrups

 This I expected him to do as shown further on he was directed by Johnston to make this very move

 My reason for mentioning this incident will appear further on

 I sent Mower s brigade over with instructions to drive the enemy beyond the Tensas Bayou and we had no further trouble in that quarter during the siege

 I make this proposition to save the further effusion of blood which must otherwise be shed to a frightful extent feeling myself fully able to maintain my position for a yet indefinite period

 If these prisoners have not been allowed to depart you will detain them until further orders

 On the th of August I further depleted my army by sending the th corps General Ord commanding to Banks

 To further confirm this Sherman s advance division will march direct from Whiteside to Trenton

 I fear that Burnside is hard pushed and that any further delay may prove fatal

 As I was with him on Orchard Knob he would not move without further orders from me

 Without awaiting further orders or stopping to reform on our troops went to the second line of works over that and on for the crest thus effectually carrying out my orders of the th for the battle and of the th for this charge

 While following the enemy on the th and again on the morning of the th part of the time by the road to Ringgold I directed Thomas verbally not to start Granger until he received further orders from me advising him that I was going to the front to more fully see the situation

 The President especially was rejoiced that Knoxville had been relieved without further bloodshed

 The weather was now cold and they were suffering but still they were ready to make the further sacrifice had it been required for the good of the cause which had brought them into service

 There was a certain incident connected with the Wilderness campaign of which it may not be out of place to speak and to avoid a digression further on I will mention it here

 The man proved to be Swinton the historian and his replies to the question were evasive and unsatisfactory and he was warned against further eaves dropping

 Having accomplished this they recrossed the Alleghanies to Meadow Bluffs and there awaited further orders

 On the th he attacked Butler with great vigor and with such success as to limit very materially the further usefulness of the Army of the James as a distinct factor in the campaign

 The further operations of the Army of the James can best be treated of in connection with those of the Army of the Potomac the two being so intimately associated and connected as to be substantially one body in which the individuality of the supporting wing is merged

 His position at Dalton was so very strongly intrenched that no doubt he expected or at least hoped to hold Sherman there and prevent him from getting any further

 The railroad was finished up to that point the intrenchments completed storehouses provided for food and the army got in readiness for a further advance

 Hancock heard the firing between Sheridan and Stuart and thinking the enemy coming by that road still further reinforced his position guarding the entrance to the Brock Road

 Another incident happened during the day to further induce Hancock to weaken his attacking column

 The second assault was repulsed again with severe loss to the enemy and Barlow was withdrawn without further molestation

 There was no fighting on the th further than a little skirmishing between Mott s division and the enemy

 Further news from Butler reported him driven from Drury s Bluff but still in possession of the Petersburg road

 When joined to Warren s corps he was no further molested

 Wright s corps coming up there was no further assault on Cold Harbor

 Hancock gave the opinion that in his front the enemy was too strong to make any further assault promise success

 Permit me to say that the hours you may fix upon for this will be agreeable to me and the same privilege will be extended to such parties as you may wish to send out on the same duty without further application

 Then too he might spare troops enough to send against Hunter who was approaching Lynchburg living upon the country he passed through and without ammunition further than what he carried with him

 The only further precaution which he could have taken and which he could not foresee would have been to have different men to execute them

 I gave him no further information however and he had no suspicion of how I expected to have the road cleared for his workmen

 In the afternoon a further attempt was made to advance but it failed

 I further directed him to repair the railroad up the Shenandoah Valley towards the advanced position which we would hold with a small force

 He succeeded in this but failed of further results by not marching past the enemy s left before turning in on the Darby road and by reason of simply coming up against their lines in place

 MAJOR GENERAL SHERMAN I have directed all recruits and new troops from the Western States to be sent to Nashville to receive their further orders from you

 No further resistance worthy of note was met with until within a few miles of Savannah

 No further explosion took place

 Sherman then before proceeding any further with operations for the capture of the place started with some troops to open communication with our fleet which he expected to find in the lower harbor or as near by as the forts of the enemy would permit

 It was all without avail further than to elicit dispatches from Thomas saying that he was getting ready to move as soon as he could that he was making preparations etc

 Without further reinforcements Canby will have a moving column of twenty thousand men

 By the first of February all preparations were completed for the final march Columbia South Carolina being the first objective Fayetteville North Carolina the second and Goldsboro or neighborhood the final one unless something further should be determined upon

 From there you could destroy the railroad and canal in every direction so as to be of no further use to the rebellion

 I further suggested that Forrest was probably in Mississippi and if he was there he would find him an officer of great courage and capacity whom it would be difficult to get by

 I still further informed him that Thomas had been ordered to start a cavalry force into Mississippi on the th of February or as soon as possible thereafter

 There was but little delay however further than that caused by high water in the stream

 When it was evacuated as we shall see further on the Confederacy at once began to crumble and fade away

 The South as we all knew were conscripting every able bodied man between the ages of eighteen and forty five and now they had passed a law for the further conscription of boys from fourteen to eighteen calling them the junior reserves and men from forty five to sixty to be called the senior reserves

 Sheridan was not however to make his movement against Five Forks until he got further instructions from me

 Unless the assault was made and was successful he would be obliged to return to Dinwiddie Court House or even further than that for the night

 Further dispatches kept coming in and as they did I sent the additional news to these points

 Sheridan followed and drove them until night when further pursuit was stopped

 This caused further delay

 In the meantime however dispatches from other sources had reached Danville and they knew there that our army was on the line of the road so that they sent no further supplies from that quarter

 He said further that for every man that was killed after this in the war somebody is responsible and it would be but very little better than murder

 The result of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia in this struggle

 I feel that it is so and regard it as my duty to shift from myself the responsibility of any further effusion of blood by asking of you the surrender of that portion of the Confederate States army known as the Army of Northern Virginia

 Though not entertaining the opinion you express on the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia I reciprocate your desire to avoid useless effusion of blood and therefore before considering your proposition ask the terms you will offer on condition of its surrender

 Then after a little further conversation General Lee remarked to me again that their army was organized a little differently from the army of the United States still maintaining by implication that we were two countries that in their army the cavalrymen and artillerists owned their own horses and he asked if he was to understand that the men who so owned their horses were to be permitted to retain them

 I then said to him that I thought this would be about the last battle of the war I sincerely hoped so and I said further I took it that most of the men in the ranks were small farmers

 Before the war was over further conscriptions took those between fourteen and eighteen years of age as junior reserves and those between forty five and sixty as senior reserves

 This call however went very much further than Mr

 When I left Appomattox I ordered General Meade to proceed leisurely back to Burkesville Station with the Army of the Potomac and the Army of the James and to go into camp there until further orders from me

 The Northern people were tired of the war they were tired of piling up a debt which would be a further mortgage upon their homes

 As the troops advanced north from Savannah the destruction of the railroads in South Carolina and the southern part of North Carolina further cut off their resources and left the armies still in Virginia and North Carolina dependent for supplies upon a very small area of country already very much exhausted of food and forage

 Banks then on an expedition up Red River against Shreveport Louisiana which had been organized previous to my appointment to command was notified by me on the th of March of the importance it was that Shreveport should be taken at the earliest possible day and that if he found that the taking of it would occupy from ten to fifteen days more time than General Sherman had given his troops to be absent from their command he would send them back at the time specified by General Sherman even if it led to the abandonment of the main object of the Red River expedition for this force was necessary to movements east of the Mississippi that should his expedition prove successful he would hold Shreveport and the Red River with such force as he might deem necessary and return the balance of his troops to the neighborhood of New Orleans commencing no move for the further acquisition of territory unless it was to make that then held by him more easily held that it might be a part of the spring campaign to move against Mobile that it certainly would be if troops enough could be obtained to make it without embarrassing other movements that New Orleans would be the point of departure for such an expedition also that I had directed General Steele to make a real move from Arkansas as suggested by him General Banks instead of a demonstration as Steele thought advisable

 From City Point directions cannot be given at this time for your further movements

 From this it was evident to my mind that the two days fighting had satisfied him of his inability to further maintain the contest in the open field notwithstanding his advantage of position and that he would wait an attack behind his works

 Deeming it impracticable to make any further attack upon the enemy at Spottsylvania Court House orders were issued on the th with a view to a movement to the North Anna to commence at twelve o clock on the night of the th

 General Grant will not be troubled with any further reinforcements to Lee from Beauregard s force

 His army therefore though in a position of great security was as completely shut off from further operations directly against Richmond as if it had been in a bottle strongly corked

 The night was clear the moon shining brightly and favorable to further operations

 He commenced crossing on the th near Fort Powhatan without further molestation and rejoined the Army of the Potomac

 These will be instructed in the absence of further orders to join you by the south side of the Potomac

 Kautz s cavalry was pushed forward on the road to the right of this supported by infantry and reached the enemy s inner line but was unable to get further

 The cavalry force of the enemy under Forrest in Northern Mississippi was evidently waiting for Sherman to advance far enough into the mountains of Georgia to make a retreat disastrous to get upon this line and destroy it beyond the possibility of further use

 In case of failure to effect a landing bring your command back to Beaufort and report to these headquarters for further instructions

 From there you could destroy the railroad and canal in every direction so as to be of no further use to the rebellion

 In the absence of further orders or until further orders are given the white divisions will follow the left column of the Army of the Potomac and the colored division the right column

 This plan he was directed to carry into execution if he received no further directions in the meantime

 That if it should not prove as entirely successful as I hoped I would cut the cavalry loose to destroy the Danville and South Side railroads and thus deprive the enemy of further supplies and also to prevent the rapid concentration of Lee s and Johnston s armies

 After having accomplished the destruction of the two railroads which are now the only avenues of supply to Lee s army you may return to this army selecting your road further south or you may go on into North Carolina and join General Sherman

 GENERAL The result of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia in this struggle

 I feel that it is so and regard it as my duty to shift from myself the responsibility of any further effusion of blood by asking of you the surrender of that portion of the Confederate States army known as the Army of Northern Virginia

 Though not entertaining the opinion you express on the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia I reciprocate your desire to avoid useless effusion of blood and therefore before considering your proposition ask the terms you will offer on condition of its surrender

 You having been over the ground in person and having heard the whole matter discussed further instructions will not be necessary for you

 Further movements will then depend on those of the enemy

 I would further ask the confirmation of General Humphreys to the rank of Major General

 Let there be no further delay

 I was just on my way to Nashville but receiving a dispatch from Van Duzer detailing your splendid success of to day I shall go no further

 Sherman s character cannot be unknown to your Excellency and on that acquaintance without further comment we might safely rest his pretensions

 We used to discuss these things at our own mess tables vehemently and sometimes quite angrily but I am sure that I never feared it would go further than it had already gone in the winter of when the attempt at nullification was promptly suppressed by President Jackson s famous declaration The Union must and shall be preserved and by the judicious management of General Scott

 Between Commodore Shubrick and General Kearney existed from that time forward the greatest harmony and good feeling and no further trouble existed as to the controlling power on the Pacific coast

 Folsom was instructed further to contract with some vessel to carry the messenger to South America where he could take the English steamers as far east as Jamaica with a conditional charter giving increased payment if the vessel could catch the October steamer

 He further explained the full programme of the branch in California that my name had been included at the insistance of Major Turner who was a man of family and property in St

 and further that he had received the principal data on which he had founded the scheme from B

 Lucas and Captain Simonds agree upon further details and then return permanently

 Lucas promptly agreed to the terms proposed and further consented on the expiration of the lease of the Adams Co

 Her passengers were transferred in small boats to the Stephens which vessel with her two thousand people crowded together with hardly standing room returned to Panama whence the passengers for the East proceeded to their destination without further delay

 The Golden Age was afterward partially repaired at Quicara pumped out and steamed to Panama when after further repairs she resumed her place in the line

 The whole conversation was gone over again and the Governor s proposition was positively agreed to with this further condition that the Vigilance Committee should send into the jail a small force of their own men to make certain that Casey should not be carried off or allowed to escape

 I further asked him to answer me categorically that very night by the Stockton boat which would pass Benicia on its way down about midnight and I would sit up and wait for his answer

 Louis that business had revived and that there was no need of further sacrifice I put all the papers with a full letter of instructions and power of attorney in the hands of William Blending Esq

 On the th of November the Governor of the State Wickliffe issued officially a general circular prepared by us giving public notice that the Seminary of Learning would open on the st day of January containing a description of the locality and the general regulations for the proposed institution and authorizing parties to apply for further information to the Superintendent at Alexandria Louisiana

 I had moved into my new house but prudently had not sent for my family nominally on the ground of waiting until the season was further advanced but really because of the storm that was lowering heavy on the political horizon

 Louis alleging further that the old Union was at an end and that a just settlement would be made between the two new fragments for all the property stored in the arsenal

 And the board further bear willing testimony to the valuable services that Colonel Sherman has rendered them in their efforts to establish an institution of learning in accordance with the beneficent design of the State and Federal Governments evincing at all times a readiness to adapt himself to the ever varying requirements of an institution of learning in its infancy struggling to attain a position of honor and usefulness

 Resolved further That in accepting the resignation of Colonel Sherman as Superintendent of the State Seminary of Learning and Military Academy we tender to him assurances of our high personal regard and our sincere regret at the occurrence of causes that render it necessary to part with so esteemed and valued a friend as well as co laborer in the cause of education

 The thing was inevitable secession was a complete success there would be no war but the two Governments would settle all matters of business in a friendly spirit and each would go on in its allotted sphere without further confusion

 He further promised on reaching Washington to give us more of his time and assistance

 I explained so fully to yourself and the Secretary of War the condition of things that I can add nothing new until further developements You know my views that this great centre of our field is too weak far too weak and I have begged and implored till I dare not say more

 And it may be remarked further that justice to General Sherman required that if at any future time his conclusions as to the amount of force necessary to conduct the operations committed to his charge should be made public the grounds on which his conclusions were based should be made public at the same time

 He further expressed the opinion that if such advance should be made and not checked the rebel force would be swollen by at least twenty thousand recruits from the disloyalists in Kentucky

 To this Lieutenant Governor Stanton replied and I further rejoined in a letter dated July 

 The evacuation of Corinth by Beauregard and the movements of General McClernand s force toward Memphis had necessitated the evacuation of Fort Pillow which occurred about June st soon followed by the further withdrawal of the Confederate army from Memphis by reason of the destruction of the rebel gunboats in the bold and dashing attack by our gun boats under command of Admiral Davis who had succeeded Foote

 He further said that his ultimate object was to capture Vicksburg to open the navigation of the Mississippi River and that General Halleck had authorized him to call on the troops in the Department of Arkansas then commanded by General S

 You will retain till further orders all troops of General Curtis now in your department

 As soon as I was in possession of General Grant s instructions of December th with a further request that I should dispatch Colonel Grierson with his cavalry across by land to Helena to notify General Steele of the general plan I returned to College Hill selected the division of Brigadier General Morgan L

 Smith to return with me to Memphis started Grierson on his errand to Helena and ordered Generals Denver and Lauman to report to General Grant for further orders

 He informed me that General Grant was not coming at all that his depot at Holly Springs had been captured by Van Dorn and that he had drawn back from Coffeeville and Oxford to Holly Springs and Lagrange and further that Quinby s division of Grant s army was actually at Memphis for stores when he passed down

 I then sent Major Hammond down the rebel line to the right with orders to stop Steele s division outside and to have the other rebel brigade stack its arms in like manner and to await further orders

 I now need only attempt to further illustrate Badeau s account by some additional details

 The rebels had evidently dispatched a force from Haines s Bluff up the Sunflower to the Rolling Fork had anticipated the movement of Admiral Porter s fleet and had completely obstructed the channel of the upper part of Deer Creek by felling trees into it so that further progress in that direction was simply impossible

 Reverdy Johnson of Baltimore asking them to see that no further harm was done

 With kind wishes for your further success I am yours truly H

 I even believe and contend further that in the North every member of the nation is bound by both natural and constitutional law to maintain and defend the Government against all its enemies and opposers whomsoever

 General Osterhaus marched the same day and on the d I was summoned to Vicksburg in person where General Grant showed me the alarming dispatches from General Halleck which had been sent from Memphis by General Hurlbut and said on further thought that he would send me and my whole corps

 The same was urged upon his successor but the lateness of the season or other causes prevented further operations after the battle of Stone River

 I was still busy in pushing forward the repairs to the rail roadbridge at Bear Creek and in patching up the many breaks between it and Tuscumbia when on the th of October as I sat on the porch of a house I was approached by a dirty black haired individual with mixed dress and strange demeanor who inquired for me and on being assured that I was in fact the man he handed me a letter from General Blair at Tuscumbia and another short one which was a telegraph message from General Grant at Chattanooga addressed to me through General George Crook commanding at Huntsville Alabama to this effect Drop all work on Memphis Charleston Railroad cross the Tennessee and hurry eastward with all possible dispatch toward Bridgeport till you meet further orders from me

 At Iuka I issued all the orders to McPherson and Hurlbut necessary for the Department of the Tennessee during my absence and further ordered the collection of a force out of the Sixteenth Corps of about eight thousand men to be commanded by General G

 General Grant further wrote that General Granger instead of moving with great rapidity as ordered seemed to move slowly and with reluctance and although he General Grant hated to call on me and on my tired troops there was no alternative

 Satisfied that I could check this by one or two quick moves inland and thereby set free a considerable body of men held as local garrisons I went up to Nashville and represented the case to General Grant who consented that I might go down the Mississippi River where the bulk of my command lay and strike a blow on the east of the river while General Banks from New Orleans should in like manner strike another to the west thus preventing any further molestation of the boats navigating the main river and thereby widening the gap in the Southern Confederacy

 Even in the seceded States your word now would go further than a President s proclamation or an act of Congress

 After reading these I further propose that you address us questions which we will answer in writing when you are to make us a concise written decision which I will have published in close connection with the subject in controversy

 My understanding was that General Grant thought it wise and prudent to give all these officers appropriate commands that would enable them to regain the influence they had lost and as a general reorganization of all the armies was then necessary he directed me to keep in mind especially the claims of Generals Buell McCook and Crittenden and endeavor to give them commands that would be as near their rank and dates of commission as possible but I was to do nothing until I heard further from him on the subject as he explained that he would have to consult the Secretary of War before making final orders

 Accordingly on the th of April I issued a general order limiting the use of the railroad cars to transporting only the essential articles of food ammunition and supplies for the army proper forbidding any further issues to citizens and cutting off all civil traffic requiring the commanders of posts within thirty miles of Nashville to haul out their own stores in wagons requiring all troops destined for the front to march and all beef cattle to be driven on their own legs

 That night I received further notice from McPherson that he had found Resaca too strong for a surprise that in consequence he had fallen back three miles to the month of Snake Creek Gap and was there fortified

 On the st of June General McPherson closed in upon the right and without attempting further to carry the enemy s strong position at New Hope Church I held our general right in close contact with it gradually carefully and steadily working by the left until our strong infantry lines had reached and secured possession of all the wagon roads between New Hope Allatoona and Acworth when I dispatched Generals Garrard s and Stoneman s divisions of cavalry into Allatoona the first around by the west end of the pass and the latter by the direct road

 Thus the real object of my move on Dallas was accomplished and on the th of June I was preparing to draw off from New Hope Church and to take position on the railroad in front of Allatoona when General Johnston himself having evacuated his position we effected the change without further battle and moved to the railroad occupying it from Allatoona and Acworth forward to Big Shanty in sight of the famous Kenesaw Mountain

 During May and prior to reaching Cassville he was further reenforced page Polk s corps of three divisions

 Our right naturally swung round so as to threaten the railroad below Marietta but Johnston had still further contracted and strengthened his lines covering Marietta and all the roads below

 On further inquiry I learned that his body must have been in possession of the enemy some minutes during which time it was rifled of the pocket book and I was much concerned lest the letter I had written him that morning should have fallen into the hands of some one who could read and understand its meaning

 Then by further thinning out Thomas s line which was well entrenched I drew another division of Palmer s corps Baird s around to the right to further strengthen that flank

 Thomas was also ordered still further to thin out his lines so as to set free the other division Johnson s of the Fourteenth Corps Palmer s which was moved to the extreme right rear and held in reserve ready to make a bold push from that flank to secure a footing on the Mason Railroad at or below East Point

 He then rode to General Thomas s camp where he made a written resignation of his office as commander of the Fourteenth Corps and was granted the usual leave of absence to go to his home in Illinois there to await further orders

 I summoned him to me and was so pleased with his spirit and confidence that I concluded to suspend the general movement of the main army and to send him with his small division of cavalry to break up the Macon road about Jonesboro in the hopes that it would force Hood to evacuate Atlanta and that I should thereby not only secure possession of the city itself but probably could catch Hood in the confusion of retreat and further to increase the chances of success

 Lovejoy s but after due refection I resolved not to attempt at that time a further pursuit of Hood s army but slowly and deliberately to move back occupy Atlanta enjoy a short period of rest and to think well over the next step required in the progress of events

 Now that Mobile is shut out to the commerce of our enemy it calls for no further effort on our part unless the capture of the city can be followed by the occupation of the Alabama River and the railroad to Columbus Georgia when that place would be a magnificent auxiliary to my further progress into Georgia but until General Canby is much reinforced and until he can more thoroughly subdue the scattered armies west of the Mississippi I suppose that much cannot be attempted by him against the Alabama River and Columbus Georgia

 My first thoughts were to concert operations with him either by way of Montgomery Alabama or by the Appalachicula but so long a line to be used as a base for further operations eastward was not advisable and I concluded to await the initiative of the enemy supposing that he would be forced to resort to some desperate campaign by the clamor raised at the South on account of the great loss to them of the city of Atlanta

 Hill resided at Madison on the main road to Augusta and seemed to realize fully the danger said that further resistance on the part of the South was madness that he hoped Governor Brown of Georgia would so proclaim it and withdraw his people from the rebellion in pursuance of what was known as the policy of separate State action

 On the next day I telegraphed further that Jeff

 Major General SHERMAN I have directed all recruits and new troops from all the Western States to be sent to Nashville to receive their further orders from you

 I ordered Resaca to be further reenforced by rail from Kingston and ordered General Cox to make a bold reconnoissance down the Coosa Valley which captured and brought into Rome some cavalrymen and a couple of field guns with their horses and men

 To these I proposed at first to add only the Fourth Corps General Stanley fifteen thousand and that corps was ordered from Gaylesville to march to Chattanooga and thence report for orders to General Thomas but subsequently on the th of October at Rome Georgia learning from General Thomas that the new troops promised by General Grant were coming forward very slowly I concluded to further reenforce him by General Schofield s corps Twenty third twelve thousand which corps accordingly marched for Resaca and there took the cars for Chattanooga

 Still I was convinced that Hood s army was in no condition to march for Nashville and that a good deal of further delay might reasonably be counted on

 Now the undertaking being a success the honor is all yours for I believe none of us went further than to acquiesce and taking the work of General Thomas into account as it should be taken it is indeed a great success

 When General Hood first struck our railroad above Marietta we were not ready and I was forced to watch his movements further till he had carromed off to the west of Decatur

 He explained further that his advance guard was a mile or so ahead so I rode on asking him to let his rear division as it came up move some distance ahead into the depression or valley beyond

 This brigade was in part armed with Spencer repeating rifles and its fire was so rapid that General Smith insists to this day that he encountered a whole division but he is mistaken he was beaten by one brigade Walcutt s and made no further effort to molest our operations from that direction

 GENERAL I have to acknowledge the receipt of a communication from you of this date in which you demand the surrender of Savannah and its dependent forts on the ground that you have received guns that can cast heavy and destructive shot into the heart of the city and for the further reason that you have for some days held and controlled every avenue by which the people and garrison can be supplied

 The ground was difficult and as all former assaults had proved so bloody I concluded to make one more effort to completely surround Savannah on all aides so as further to excite Hardee s fears and in case of success to capture the whole of his army

 Without waiting further directions than you may make your preparations to start on your northern expedition without delay

 Now that you are in possession of Savannah and there can be no further fears about supplies would it not be possible for you to reopen these avenues of escape for the negroes without interfering with your military operations Could not such escaped slaves find at least a partial supply of food in the rice fields about Savannah and cotton plantations on the coast I merely throw out these suggestions

 Of course I gave out with some ostentation especially among the rebels that we were going to Charleston or Augusta but I had long before made up my mind to waste no time on either further than to play off on their fears thus to retain for their protection a force of the enemy which would otherwise concentrate in our front and make the passage of some of the great rivers that crossed our route more difficult and bloody

 Without further reenforcement Canby will have a moving column of twenty thousand men

 Having thus secured the passage of the Pedee I felt no uneasiness about the future because there remained no further great impediment between us and Cape Fear River which I felt assured was by that time in possession of our friends

 I shall start with no distinct view further than holding Lee s forces from following Sheridan

 No further destruction of railroads mills cotton and produce will be made without the specific orders of an army commander and the inhabitants will be dealt with kindly looking to an early reconciliation

 I am therefore induced to address you in this form the inquiry whether to stop the further effusion of blood and devastation of property you are willing to make a temporary suspension of active operations and to commnnicate to Lieutenant General Grant commanding the armies of the United States the request that he will take like action in regard to other armies the object being to permit the civil authorities to enter into the needful arrangements to terminate the existing war

 He plainly and repeatedly admitted this and added that any further fighting would be murder but he thought that instead of surrendering piecemeal we might arrange terms that would embrace all the Confederate armies

 In the mean time however I did think that my rank if not past services entitled me at least to trust that the Secretary of War would keep secret what was communicated for the use of none but the cabinet until further inquiry could be made instead of giving publicity to it along with documents which I never saw and drawing therefrom inferences wide of the truth

 Beauregard has telegraphed to Danville that a new arrangement has been made with Sherman and that the advance of the Sixth Corps was to be suspended until further orders

 Some of you will go to your homes and others will be retained in military service till further orders

 The only change that breech loading arms will probably make in the art and practice of war will be to increase the amount of ammunition to be expended and necessarily to be carried along to still further thin out the lines of attack and to reduce battles to short quick decisive conflicts

 I would further illustrate my meaning by describing a man of true courage to be one who possesses all his faculties and senses perfectly when serious danger is actually present

 Sieges such as characterized the wars of the last century are too slow for this period of the world and the Prussians recently almost ignored them altogether penetrated France between the forts and left a superior force in observation to watch the garrison and accept its surrender when the greater events of the war ahead made further resistance useless but earth forts and especially field works will hereafter play an important part in war because they enable a minor force to hold a superior one in check for a time and time is a most valuable element in all wars

 I quote further The object of this law is to confer on the commander of troops whatever liberty of action the case demands

 The executive power is further subdivided into the seven great departments and to the Secretary of War is confided the general care of the military establishment and his powers are further subdivided into ten distinct and separate bureaus

 Logan for muster out or further orders

 I further argued that General Grant was at the moment engaged on the most delicate and difficult task of reorganizing the army under the act of July that if the real object was to put Mr

 He answered that he had and thought well of General Cox but would say no further

 Stanton would have no effect unless it was to incur further his displeasure and therefore did not directly suggest it to him

 This may if necessary be a subject for further consideration

 Until further orders from the President you will assign no officer to the permanent command of the Military Division of the Missouri

 In consequence we were compelled to give up further efforts to advance and obliged to turn back to the abandoned village where we encamped for the night

 Besides it led to further complications and troubles for it had begun to dawn upon the Indians that the whites wanted to come in and dispossess them of their lands and homes and the failures of Haller and Rains fostered the belief with the Indians that they could successfully resist the pressure of civilization

 Further skirmishing at long range took place at intervals during the day with little gain or loss however to either side for both parties held positions which could not be assailed in flank and only the extreme of rashness in either could prompt a front attack

 A further examination proved that all the guns were in the same condition

 I questioned him closely to elicit further information but no more could be obtained for Meek either through ignorance or the usual taciturnity of his class did not explain more fully and when the steamer that had brought the reinforcement started down the river he took passage for Vancouver to learn definitely if the Indian family had reached that point

 When it had gone about seven miles the sergeant in charge came back to the post and reported his inability to get any further

 The situation at Yaquina Bay did not seem very safe notwithstanding the supply of beef we brought and the possibility that the starving Indians might break out was ever present so to anticipate any further revolt I called for more troops

 When this reinforcement arrived the Indians saw the futility of further demonstrations against their agent who they seemed to think was responsible for the insufficiency of food and managed to exist with the slender rations we could spare and such indifferent food as they could pick up until the Indian Department succeeded in getting up its regular supplies

 The troubles at the Siletz and Yaquina Bay were settled without further excitement by the arrival in due time of plenty of food and as the buildings at Fort Haskins were so near completion that my services as quartermaster were no longer needed I was ordered to join my own company at Fort Yamhill where Captain Russell was still in command

 Fearing that the insubordinate conduct of the Indians would precipitate further trouble she came early the following morning to see me and tell me of the situation Mary informed me that she had done all in her power to bring the Indians to reason but without avail and that they were determined to fight rather than deliver up the sixteen men who had engaged in the shooting

 After the consultation he returned and notified me that fifteen would surrender and the six shooter would be restored and further that we could kill the sixteenth man since the tribe wished to get rid of him anyhow adding that he was a bad Indian whose bullet no doubt had given the woman her death wound

 The news came by the pony express across the Plains to San Francisco where it was still further magnified in republishing and gained somewhat in Southern bias

 When relieved from further duty at Yamhill by Captain Owen I left for the Atlantic coast to join my new regiment

 The headquarters of my regiment were at Jefferson Barracks Missouri to which point I proceeded with no further delay except a stay in the city of St

 After a further consultation with Captain Alger and Lieutenant Walbridge I determined to go to the General again and further present the case

 We were not molested further and resumed our work intending to extend the break toward Baldwin but receiving orders from Elliott to return to Booneville immediately the men were recalled and we started to rejoin the main command

 Under such circumstances my prisoners would prove a decided embarrassment so I abandoned further attempts to get them together not even paroling them which I thought might have been done with but little risk

 In the meantime the captured cars had been fired and as their complete destruction was assured by explosions from those containing ammunition they needed no further attention so I withdrew my men and hastened to join Elliott taking along some Confederate officers whom I had retained from among four or five hundred prisoners captured when making the original dash below the town

 Captain Campbell being in advance hurriedly dismounted his battalion for a further forward movement on foot but it was readily seen that the enemy was present in such heavy force as almost to ensure our destruction and I gave orders for a hasty withdrawal

 I knew from practical experience on the frontier that my efforts in this direction would not only be appreciated but requited by personal affection and gratitude and further that such exertions would bring the best results to me

 At this juncture the timely arrival of Colonel Hatch with the Second Iowa gave a breathing spell to Campbell and made the Confederates so chary of further direct attacks that he was enabled to retire and at the same time I found opportunity to make disposition of the reinforcement to the best advantage possible placing the Second Iowa on the left of the new line and strengthening Campbell on its right with all the men available

 The result mortified the captain intensely and deeming his convoy of little further use he steamed toward Cairo in quest of other imaginary batteries while I re embarked at Caseyville and continued up the Ohio undisturbed

 The fury of the Confederate assault soon halted this advance force and in a short time threw it into confusion pushed it back a considerable distance and ultimately inflicted upon it such loss of men and guns as to seriously cripple McCook s corps and prevent for the whole day further offensive movement on his part though he stoutly resisted the enemy s assaults until o clock in the afternoon

 So notwithstanding the pressure from Washington the army was soon put in motion for Nashville and when we arrived there my division went into camp north of the river on a plateau just outside the little town of Edgefield until the movements of the enemy should be further developed

 At first only slight skirmishing took place but when we came within about three miles of Murfreesboro the resistance of the enemy s pickets grew serious and a little further on so strong that I had to put in two regiments to push them back

 He talked the matter over with us for some little time but in view of the offensive defensive part he was to play in the coming battle did not seem to think that there was a necessity for any further dispositions than had already been taken

 Inquiring who they were and for further details I was informed that there certainly were in the command two females that in some mysterious manner had attached themselves to the service as soldiers that one an East Tennessee woman was a teamster in the division wagon train and the other a private soldier in a cavalry company temporarily attached to my headquarters for escort duty

 Deeming that further effort should be made however under guidance of Card I turned the head of my column in the direction of Alisona marching up the river and nearly parallel with it till I came to Rock Creek

 As soon as I learned that Davis was across I pushed on but the delay had permitted the enemy to pull his rear guard up on the mountain and rendered nugatory all further efforts to hurt him materially our only returns consisting in forcing him to relinquish a small amount of transportation and forage at the mouth of the pass just beyond Cowan a station on the line of the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad

 Nothing further could now be done so I instructed Watkins to rejoin the division at Cowan and being greatly fatigued by the hard campaigning of the previous ten days I concluded to go back to my camp in a more comfortable way than on the back of my tired horse

 Further investigation next day showed however that when it reached the foot of the mountain where the railroad formed a junction the improvised crew in the belief no doubt that the University was on the main line instead of near the branch to Tracy City followed the main stem until it carried them clear across the range down the Crow Creek Valley where the party was captured

 The march of McCook s corps from Valley Head to Alpine was in pursuance of orders directing it to advance on Summerville the possession of which place would further threaten the enemy s communications it being assumed that Bragg was in full retreat south as he had abandoned Chattanooga on the th

 Our unmolested retirement from Rossville lent additional force to the belief that the enemy had been badly injured and further impressed me with the conviction that we might have held on

 Under these circumstances on the th of November the Fourth Corps Granger s took up the line of march for Knoxville my men carrying in their haversacks four days rations depending for a further supply of food on a small steamboat loaded with subsistence stores which was to proceed up the Tennessee River and keep abreast of the column

 The latter next unloaded it on me and there is no telling what the final outcome would have been had I not entered a protest against a further continuance of the practice which remonstrance brought Granger to the front at Dandridge

 I told him that if he would let me use the cavalry as I contemplated he need have little solicitude in these respects for with a mass of ten thousand mounted men it was my belief that I could make it so lively for the enemy s cavalry that so far as attacks from it were concerned the flanks and rear of the Army of the Potomac would require little or no defense and claimed further that moving columns of infantry should take care of their own fronts

 I also told him that he had broken up my combinations exposed Wilson s division to disaster and kept Gregg unnecessarily idle and further repelled his insinuations by saying that such disjointed operations as he had been requiring of the cavalry for the last four days would render the corps inefficient and useless before long

 The appearance of Davies s brigade at Ashland in the morning had had the effect of further mystifying the enemy as to my intentions and while he held it incumbent to place himself between me and Richmond yet he was still so uncertain of my movements that he committed the same fault that he did the first day when he divided his force and sent a part to follow me on the Childsburg road

 To attain this end in the presence of an ever watchful foe who had just recently been reinforced in considerable numbers from Richmond and further south almost enough to make up the losses he had sustained in the Wilderness and at Spottsylvania required the most vigorous and zealous work on the part of those to whom had been allotted the task of carrying out the initial manoeuvres

 The morning of the st I visited him to arrange for his further advance intending thus to anticipate an expected attack from Fitzhugh Lee who was being reinforced by infantry

 By the th of June General Grant again determined to continue the movement of the army by its left flank to the south bank of the James River his unsuccessful attack on the enemy s works near Cold Harbor having demonstrated that Lee s position north of the Chickahominy could not be carried by assault with results that would compensate for the enormous loss of life which must follow therefore a further attempt to fight a decisive battle north of Richmond was abandoned

 The defeat of Hampton at the point where he had determined to resist my further advance and his retreat westward gave me undisturbed possession of the station and after destroying the railroad to some extent toward Gordonsville I went into camp

 I was still further influenced to this course by the burden which was thrown on me in the large number of wounded there being about five hundred cases of my own and the five hundred prisoners that I would probably be forced to abandon should I proceed farther

 This development rendered useless any further effort on Hancock s part or mine to carry out the plan of the expedition for General Grant did not intend Hancock to assault the enemy s works unless there should be found in them but a very thin line of infantry which could be surprised

 When the attempt to take Petersburg in conjunction with the mine explosion resulted in such a dismal failure all the operations contemplated in connection with that project came to a standstill and there was every prospect that the intensely hot and sultry weather would prevent further activity in the Army of the Potomac till a more propitious season

 These will be instructed in the absence of further orders to join you by the south side of the Potomac

 My object in securing the fords was to further my march on Winchester from the southeast since from all the information gathered during the th I still thought Early could be brought to a stand at that point but in this I was mistaken as Torbert s reconnoissance proved for on the morning of the th when Merritt had driven the Confederate cavalry then covering the Millwood pike west of the Opequon off toward Kernstown he found that their infantry and artillery were retreating south up the Valley pike

 Carry off stock of all descriptions and negroes so as to prevent further planting

 When cautioned by Crook who knew them well and reminded that the valley had hitherto been a race course one day in the possession of friends and the next of enemies and warned of the dangers they were incurring by such demonstrations they assured him that they had no further fears of that kind now adding that Early s army was so demoralized by the defeat it had just sustained that it would never be in condition to enter Winchester again

 The restoration of the lower valley from the Potomac to Strasburg to the control of the Union forces caused great rejoicing in the North and relieved the Administration from further solicitude for the safety of the Maryland and Pennsylvania borders

 Soon after General Wright had established this line I rode with him along it to the westward and finding that the enemy was still holding an elevated position further to our right on the north side of Tumbling Run I directed this also to be occupied

 I was satisfied moreover that my transportation could not supply me further than Harrisonburg and if in penetrating the Blue Ridge I met with protracted resistance a lack of supplies might compel me to abandon the attempt at a most inopportune time

 MAJOR GENERAL SHERIDAN Lieutenant General Grant wishes a position taken far enough south to serve as a base for further operations upon Gordonsville and Charlottesville

 However I went down stairs and requested that breakfast be hurried up and at the same time ordered the horses to be saddled and in readiness for I concluded to go to the front before any further examinations were made in regard to the defensive line

 This repulse of the Confederates made me feel pretty safe from further offensive operations on their part and I now decided to suspend the fighting till my thin ranks were further strengthened by the men who were continually coming up from the rear and particularly till Crook s troops could be assembled on the extreme left

 At this time General Grant wished me to send him the Sixth Corps and it was got ready for the purpose but when I informed him that Torbert s reconnoissance had developed the fact that Early still retained four divisions of infantry and one of cavalry it was decided on my suggestion to let the Sixth Corps remain till the season should be a little further advanced when the inclemency of the weather would preclude infantry campaigning

 This slight success of the Confederates in West Virginia and the intelligence that they were contemplating further raids in that section led me to send Crook there with one division his other troops going to City Point and I hoped that all the threatened places would thus be sufficiently protected but negligence at Beverly resulted in the capture of that station by Rosser on the th of January

 In the meanwhile the enemy had marched to Hanover Court House but being unable either to cross the Pamunkey there or forestall me at the White House on the south side of the river he withdrew to Richmond without further effort to impede my column

 My uneasiness made me somewhat too earnest I fear but General Grant soon mollified me and smoothed matters over by practically repeating what he had told me in regard to this point at the close of our interview the day before so I pursued the subject no further

 His better judgment was against suspending operations but the proposition had been suggested by all sorts of complaints as to the impossibility of moving the trains and the like so it needed little argument to convince him and without further discussion he said in that manner which with him meant a firmness of purpose that could not be changed by further complainings We will go on

 Then Lee made no further stand except at the west side of the Gillian field where assisted by Corse s brigade he endeavored to cover the retreat but just before dark Custer in concert with some Fifth Corps regiments under Colonel Richardson drove ihe last of the enemy westward on the White Oak road

 When the news of the battle at Five Forks reached General Grant he realized that the decisive character of our victory would necessitate the immediate abandonment of Richmond and Petersburg by the enemy and fearing that Lee would escape without further injury he issued orders the propriety of which must be settled by history to assault next morning the whole intrenched line

 By shifting to the left Merritt gained the Rice s Station road west of the creek making havoc of the wagon trains while Crook struck them further on and planted himself square across the road

 What he then did and what his intentions and orders were are further confirmed by a reference to the episode in his Memoirs where he gives his reasons for ordering the Sixth Corps to abandon the move on Amelia Court House and pass to the left of the army

 Without halting to look after the cars further Custer attacked this advance guard and had a spirited fight in which he drove the Confederates away from the station captured twenty five pieces of artillery a hospital train and a large park of wagons which in the hope that they would reach Lynchburg next day were being pushed ahead of Lee s main body

 From this ground they could see Ord s men emerging from the woods and the hopelessness of a further attack being plain the gray lines instinctively halted and then began to retire toward a ridge immediately fronting Appomattox Court House while Ord joined on his right by the Fifth Corps advanced on them over the ground that Merritt had abandoned

 Custer was soon ready but Devin s division being in rear its formation took longer since he had to shift further to the right Devin s preparations were therefore but partially completed when an aide decamp galloped up to with the word from Custer Lee has surrendered do not charge the white flag is up

 They knew that henceforth systematic direction would be given to our armies in every section of the vast territory over which active operations were being prosecuted and further that this coherence this harmony of plan was the one thing needed to end the war for in the three preceding years there had been illustrated most lamentable effects of the absence of system

 Lincoln had been shot at o clock that morning at Willard s Hotel but as I could conceive of nothing to take the President there I set the story down as a canard and went to bed without giving it further thought

 The letter also said that any further pursuit of Early would be useless as he expected to be on the deep blue sea by the time his communication reached me

 Colonel Sedgwick commanding at Brownsville was now temporary master of Matamoras also by reason of having stationed some American troops there for the protection of neutral merchants so when Ortega appeared at Brazos Sedgwick quietly arrested him and held him till the city of Matamoras was turned over to General Escobedo the authorized representative of Juarez then Escobedo took charge of Ortega and with ease prevented his further machinations

 On my way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on the night of July by one of my staff who reported what had occurred giving the details of the massacre no milder term is fitting and informing me that to prevent further slaughter General Baird the senior military officer present had assumed control of the municipal government

 The old commissioners refused to recognize this new board and of course a conflict of authority ensued which it was clear would lead to vicious results if allowed to continue so as the people of the State had no confidence in either of the boards I decided to end the contention summarily by appointing an entirely new commission which would disburse the money honestly and further the real purpose for which it had been appropriated

 Wells having vacated Governor Flanders began immediately the exercise of his duties in sympathy with the views of Congress and I then notified General Grant that I thought he need have no further apprehension about the condition of affairs in Louisiana as my appointee was a man of such integrity and ability that I already felt relieved of half my labor

 It was no small nor easy task to outfit all these troops by the time cold weather set in and provide for them during the winter but by the st of November I had enough supplies accumulated at Forts Dodge and Lyon for my own and Carr s columns and in addition directed subsistence and forage for three months to be sent to Fort Gibson for final delivery at Fort Arbuckle as I expected to feed the command from this place when we arrived in the neighborhood of old Fort Cobb but through some mismanagement few of these stores got further than Gibson before winter came on

 Further waiting however would give the Indians a chance to recover from the recent dispiriting defeat so I sent out scouting parties to look Crawford up and hurry him along

 Convinced of the sincerity of their professions I gave them a reasonable extension and eventually Yellow Bear made good his word but Little Robe in spite of earnest and repeated efforts was unable to deliver his people till further operations were begun against them

 Washburn pursued the matter no further

 He said further that he had been reluctant to enter upon this public career that he had always longed to be a soldier but that here again family opposition had turned him from the field of his choice into the sphere of diplomacy

 Here the slaughter was terrible for the horsemen could make no further headway and because of the blockade behind of dead and wounded men and animals an orderly retreat was impossible and disaster inevitable

 He too thought it would answer our purpose but on reaching it we found the unburned part of the barn filled with wounded and this necessitating a further search we continued on through the village in quest of some house not yet converted into a hospital

 The King traveled further than usual that day to Clermont so we did not get shelter till late and even then not without some confusion for the quartermaster having set out toward Chalons before the change of programme was ordered was not at hand to provide for us

 Between and o clock Colonel von Bronsart returned from his mission to Sedan bringing word to the King that the commanding officer there General Wimpffen wished to know in order that the further effusion of blood might be spared upon what terms he might surrender

 It was after o clock now and hence too late to arrange anything more where we were so further negotiations were deferred till later in the evening and I wishing to be conveniently near Bismarck resolved to take up quarters in Donchery

 After a word or two the party moved perhaps a hundred yards further on where they stopped opposite the weaver s cottage so famous from that day

 Then the Chancellor continued to chat a few minutes longer assuring me that nothing further was to be done there and that we had better go to the Chateau Bellevue where he said the formal surrender was to take place

 I further heard that the military advisers of the King strongly advocated an immediate move on Paris while the Chancellor thought it best to make peace now holding Alsace and Lorraine and compelling the payment of an enormous levy of money and these rumors were most likely correct for I had often heard Bismarck say that France being the richest country in Europe nothing could keep her quiet but effectually to empty her pockets and besides this he impressed me as holding that it would be better policy to preserve the Empire

 Although the number of dead was in utter disproportion to the terrific six hour cannonade yet small as it was the torn and mangled bodies made such a horrible sight that we turned back toward Bazeilles without having gone further than Givonne

 As I drew up by the party Bismarck accosted me with Well General aren t you hungry This is just the place to whet one s appetite these burning Frenchmen Ugh and shrugging his shoulders in evident disgust he turned away to join his Majesty in further explorations Forsyth and I continuing on to Chevenges

 A half mile further on we met Bismarck

 Thiers to represent the executive power of the country with authority to construct a ministry three commissioners were appointed by the Executive to enter into further negotiations with Count Bismarck at Versailles and arrange a peace the terms of which however were to be submitted to the convention for final action

 Besides granting that we were still in the neighborhood of the island why should not Augustus have visited me and informed me of the circumstance Pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of my solitary and cheerless condition I resolved to wait yet another twenty four hours when if no relief were obtained I would make my way to the trap and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend or get at least a little fresh air through the opening and a further supply of water from the stateroom

 Thus the gloom of my prison may be imagined and the note of my friend if indeed it were a note from him seemed only likely to throw me into further trouble by disquieting to no purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind

 Upon finding his further progress in the hold impeded by obstacles which he could not overcome he had resolved to abandon his attempt at reaching me and return at once to the forecastle

 He had spoken to Jones about taking the command from the mate but the project having been coolly received he had been deterred from pressing the matter any further or from saying any thing to the cook

 On recovery my trepidation had entirely vanished I felt a new being and with some little further aid from my companion reached the bottom also in safety

 My companion being thus released we had no further difficulty

 When Madame Lalande was called upon to sing the younger lady was intended and it was she who arose to obey the call my great great grandmother to further the deception arising at the same moment and accompanying her to the piano in the main drawing room

 Without beginning ab ovo on a subject so light a matter of importance however to many a modern Catius or Amasinius by investigating the origin of the Art of Cookery and the nature of it as practised by the Antediluvians without dilating on the several particulars concerning it afterwards amongst the Patriarchs as found in the Bible I shall turn myself immediately and without further preamble to a few cursory observations respecting the Greeks Romans Britons and those other nations Saxons Danes and Normans with whom the people of this nation are more closely connected

 It appears further from Fleta that the chief cooks were often providers as well as dressers of victuals 

 I observe further in regard to this point that the quantities of things are seldom specified but are too much left to the taste and judgement of the cook if he should happen to be rash and inconsiderate or of a bad and undistinguishing taste was capable of doing much harm to the guests to invalids especially

 The common language of the formul though old and obsolete as naturally may be expected from the age of the MS has no other difficulty in it but what may easily be overcome by a small degree of practice and application however for the further illustration of this matter and the satisfaction of the curious a fac simile of one of the recipes is represented in the annexed plate

 Then Telemachus said Eurymachus and you other suitors I shall say no more and entreat you no further for the gods and the people of Ithaca now know my story

 Some things Telemachus answered Minerva will be suggested to you by your own instinct and heaven will prompt you further for I am assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth until now

 If on the other hand I swim further in search of some shelving beach or harbour a hurricane may carry me out to sea again sorely against my will or heaven may send some great monster of the deep to attack me for Amphitrite breeds many such and I know that Neptune is very angry with me

 Pear grows on pear apple on apple and fig on fig and so also with the grapes for there is an excellent vineyard on the level ground of a part of this the grapes are being made into raisins in another part they are being gathered some are being trodden in the wine tubs others further on have shed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit others again are just changing colour

 Arete was the first to speak for she recognised the shirt cloak and good clothes that Ulysses was wearing as the work of herself and of her maids so she said Stranger before we go any further there is a question I should like to ask you

 Nevertheless there was still much trouble in store for me for at this point Neptune would let me go no further and raised a great storm against me the sea was so terribly high that I could no longer keep to my raft which went to pieces under the fury of the gale and I had to swim for it till wind and current brought me to your shores

 You can sleep during the whole voyage if you like and the men shall sail you over smooth waters either to your own home or wherever you please even though it be a long way further off than Euboea which those of my people who saw it when they took yellow haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus the son of Gaia tell me is the furthest of any place and yet they did the whole voyage in a single day without distressing themselves and came back again afterwards

 When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from his eyes uncovered his face and taking his cup made a drink offering to the gods but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus to sing further for they delighted in his lays then Ulysses again drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly

 Ulysses answered Laodamas why do you taunt me in this way my mind is set rather on cares than contests I have been through infinite trouble and am come among you now as a suppliant praying your king and people to further me on my return home

 They started at once and went about among the Lotus eaters who did them no hurt but gave them to eat of the lotus which was so delicious that those who ate of it left off caring about home and did not even want to go back and say what had happened to them but were for staying and munching lotus with the Lotus eaters without thinking further of their return nevertheless though they wept bitterly I forced them back to the ships and made them fast under the benches

 I was bringing it to you as a drink offering in the hope that you would take compassion upon me and further me on my way home whereas all you do is to go on ramping and raving most intolerably

 Do not they exclaimed be mad enough to provoke this savage creature further he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us back again to the mainland and we made sure it had been the death of us if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have pounded our heads and our ship s timbers into a jelly with the rugged rocks he would have heaved at us for he can throw them a long way

 I told him exactly how everything had happened and when I said I must go and asked him to further me on my way he made no sort of difficulty but set about doing so at once

 They were astounded when they saw us and said Ulysses what brings you here What god has been ill treating you We took great pains to further you on your way home to Ithaca or wherever it was that you wanted to go to

 She will then be frightened and will desire you to go to bed with her on this you must not point blank refuse her for you want her to set your companions free and to take good care also of yourself but you must make her swear solemnly by all the blessed gods that she will plot no further mischief against you or else when she has got you naked she will unman you and make you fit for nothing

 I shall certainly not consent to go to bed with you unless you will first take your solemn oath to plot no further harm against me

 Thrice I sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms but each time she flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom and being touched to the quick I said to her Mother why do you not stay still when I would embrace you If we could throw our arms around one another we might find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows even in the house of Hades does Proserpine want to lay a still further load of grief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only My son she answered most ill fated of all mankind it is not Proserpine that is beguiling you but all people are like this when they are dead

 They sang these words most musically and as I longed to hear them further I made signs by frowning to my men that they should set me free but they quickened their stroke and Eurylochus and Perimedes bound me with still stronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of the Sirens voices

 As for Scylla the father of gods and men would not let her get further sight of me otherwise I should have certainly been lost

 Then Minerva put it into the mind of Penelope to show herself to the suitors that she might make them still more enamoured of her and win still further honour from her son and husband

 This further grief moreover cuts me to the very heart

 And now I do not see how I can find any further shift for getting out of this marriage

 Many a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her and Penelope wept as she listened for her heart was melted

 Then Ulysses answered Madam wife of Ulysses do not disfigure yourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss though I can hardly blame you for doing so

 Ulysses will not return neither will you get your escort hence for so surely as that Ulysses ever was there are now no longer any such masters in the house as he was to receive honourable strangers or to further them on their way home

 And there is this further difficulty which is still more considerable

 I have long seen you killing my sheep and making free with my corn and wine I have put up with this for one man is no match for many but do me no further violence

 But she would not give him full victory as yet for she wished still further to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son so she flew up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon it in the form of a swallow

 Yet further the comet snatches for the convenience of its travelers both air and water

 He had sought in vain for further trace of the huge disc that had so excited his wonder on the st and it seemed most probable that in its irregular orbit it had been carried beyond the range of vision

 By the th Venus was sufficiently remote to preclude any further fear of collision

 What could it be It could not be the coast of Tripoli for not only would that low lying shore be quite invisible at such a distance but it was certain moreover that it lay two degrees at least still further south

 They could be under no misapprehension as to the distance they had positively sailed from Gourbi Island towards the east before their further progress was arrested by the unknown shore as nearly as possible that was fifteen degrees the length of the narrow strait by which they had made their way across that land to regain the open sea was about three miles and a half thence onward to the island which they had been assured on evidence that they could not disbelieve to be upon the site of Gibraltar was four degrees while from Gibraltar to Gourbi Island was seven degrees or but little more

 But how about the new orbit in which we are moving He paused and pondered and then looked at Procope as though awaiting from him some further elucidation of the difficulty

 And thus all further thought of making their way again to the little garrison of Gibraltar was abandoned

 Taking all these things into account it was agreed that further investigations should be deferred to a more favorable season and that without delay the Dobryna should return to Gourbi Island

 Before entering upon further explanation he said that he counted upon the cordial co operation of them all for the common welfare

 CHAPTER XX A LIGHT ON THE HORIZON On the following day without giving himself any further concern about the Jew s incredulity the captain gave orders for the Hansa to be shifted round to the harbor of the Shelif

 On returning to the gourbi they communicated their discovery to Count Timascheff only deeming any further publication of it to be premature

 A continuous rumbling that increased as they advanced made them aware that they must be approaching the central funnel of the volcano their only fear was lest some insuperable wall of rock should suddenly bar their further progress

 On further investigation an unexpected number of galleries was discovered so that in fact the interior of the mountain was like a vast bee hive perforated with innumerable cells and in compliment to the little Italian it was unanimously voted by the colony that their new home should be called Nina s Hive

 The domestic animals required a great deal of attention a supply of food had to be secured and preserved fishing had to be carried on while the condition of the sea would allow it and in several places the galleries had to be further excavated to render them more available for use

 Having this ultimate object in view he assembled his little colony upon a projecting rock at the extremity of the promontory and having called Nina and Pablo out to him in front he said Now Nina do you think you could throw something into the sea I think I could replied the child but I am sure that Pablo would throw it a great deal further than I can

 Of the present distance of Gallia from the sun and the number of leagues she had traversed since the receipt of the last mysterious document there were no means of judging the extent of diminution in the apparent disc of the sun did not afford sufficient basis even for an approximate calculation and Captain Servadac was perpetually regretting that they could receive no further tidings from the anonymous correspondent whom he persisted in regarding as a fellow countryman

 A comet The discovery was fatal to all further progress in the triangulation

 The astronomer bit his lip snorted and cast at him a withering look but did not take any further notice

 Lieutenant Procope further remarked that from the earth he supposed it to be about as conspicuous as a star of the seventh magnitude and would require a good telescope to see it

 Nothing further now remained than to apply the investigations thus finished to the determining of the mass or weight

 On the st of September the distance between Gallia and Jupiter was precisely the same as the mean distance between the earth and the sun on the th the distance was further reduced to leagues

 It was further observed that Jupiter itself was almost void of scintillation

 Hakkabut said the captain plunging without further preface into business we want some coffee some tobacco and other things

 After all they were practically a thousand times further off than the great astronomers have been able to approach by means of their giant telescopes

 They have made their representations something in this way Suppose they say an observer endowed with an infinite length of vision suppose him stationed on the surface of Capella looking thence towards the earth he would be a spectator of events that had happened seventy years previously transport him to a star ten times distant and he will be reviewing the terrestrial sphere of years back carry him away further still to a star so remote that it requires something less than nineteen centuries for light to reach it and he would be a witness of the birth and death of Christ convey him further again and he shall be looking upon the dread desolation of the Deluge take him away further yet for space is infinite and he shall be a spectator of the Creation of the spheres

 There was no advantage in proceeding any further along the lava course they could already hear the dull rumblings that indicated that they were at no great distance from the central focus

 Conscious how impolitic it would be to press this matter further the captain casually remarked that he should have supposed that all the elements of Nerina had been calculated long since by astronomers on the earth

 The three leaders with Ben Zoof made their way to the lower depths of the crater not with the design of making any further examination as to the nature of the rock for although it might be true enough that it contained thirty per cent

 Rosette scanned his countenance narrowly and was about to probe him with further questions when Ben Zoof returned

 And without further parley followed by his soldiers he retired into the casemate leaving Captain Servadac gnawing his mustache with mingled rage and mortification

 Having refused to quit their post the Englishmen had virtually excluded themselves from any further consideration they had had their warning and must now take the consequences of their own incredulity

 For themselves the all important problem was what effect would the rending asunder of the comet have upon its rate of progress and as they were already conscious of a further increase of muscular power and a fresh diminution of specific gravity Servadac and his associates could not but wonder whether the alteration in the mass of the comet would not result in its missing the expected coincidence with the earth altogether

 At Seven Cascades on its eastern slope one of Rogers s Rangers retreating after the Canadian foray fell to the ground too tired for further motion when a distant music of harps mingled with the cascade s plash and directly the waters were peopled with forms glowing with silverwhite like the moonstone that rose and circled hand in hand singing gayly as they did so

 Since the Nicene Council by a pious fraud which I shall further allude to suppressed these books several of them have been reissued from time to time by various translators who differed considerably in their versions as the historical references attached to them in the following pages will demonstrate

 He further said that he ought first to be free from that curse by begetting some issue and then come with his offerings into the presence of God

 And we found in the first of the seventy books where Michael the archangel is speaking to the third son of Adam the first man an account that after five thousand five hundred years Christ the most beloved son of God was to come on earth And we further considered that perhaps he was the very God of Israel who spoke to Moses Thou shalt make the ark of the testimony two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof and a cubit and a half the height thereof

 The Resurrection further proved

 BUT let us go yet further and inquire whether this people be the heir or the former and whether the covenant be with us or with them

 Further expresses his desire to suffer

 in the Lambeth library and the learned prelate himself still further improved the whole from a multitude of fragments of the original Greek never before used for that purpose

 Then he became very moody and would say nothing further

 The poor man had probably received the money from the dean and had told the lie about it not choosing to own that he had taken the money from his rich friend and thinking that there would be no further inquiry

 Then whence had he received it The poor wife was left by the lawyer to obtain further information from her husband

 She herself would write again to the dean about it but she hardly hoped for any further assistance there

 Then Mrs Crawley could say nothing further beyond making protestations of her husband s innocence

 But the matter had been discussed further afield than at Silverbridge and had been allowed to intrude itself as a most unwelcome subject into the family conclave of the archdeacon s rectory

 Her brother Henry she would be glad to meet and hoped to make some arrangement with him for a short visit to Hartlebury her husband s place in Shropshire as to which latter hint it may however be at once said that nothing further was spoken after the Crawley alliance had been suggested

 The archdeacon filled his glass unconsciously and sipped his wine while he thought what further he might say

 Perhaps it might be better that he should say nothing further at the moment

 At the further end of the room there was an ancient piece of furniture which was always called papa s secretary at which Mr Crawley customarily sat and wrote his sermons and did all work that was done by him within the house

 But when this terrible affair came on about the cheque which had been lost and found and traced to Mr Crawley s hands Miss Anne Prettyman said nothing further to Grace Crawley about Major Grantly

 Major Grantly had done that which made him think it imperative upon him to do something further and do that something at once

 And I am to get further into debt he said

 Early on the following morning she contrived to let him know that she was about to send a neighbour s son over with a note to Mr Walker fearing to urge him further to change his mind but hoping that he might express his purpose of doing so when he heard that the letter was to be sent but he took no notice whatever of her words

 He had been for many years a medical man practising in a little village in the further end of the county but it had come to be his fate late in life to marry a great heiress with whose money the ancient house and domain of Chaldicotes had been purchased from the Sowerbys

 Mr Mason made a quick movement forward intending to explain that that consideration need offer no impediment but was stopped by further speech by Mr Crawley

 And Mr Walker explained further that he and the bailsmen were ready and that the bail bond was prepared

 Mrs Crawley pursued her cross examination no further but made up her mind that it would be better that her girl should be away from her wretched home during this period of her life

 How the bishop strove to teach his wife with the mildest words what really ought to be a dean s duty and how the wife rejoined by teaching her husband not in the mildest words what ought to be a bishop s duty we will not further inquire here

 In either case may the Lord be with you and keep your feet from further stumbling

 When the world believe the worst of the poor Having so spoken Mr Crawley rose from his chair and hurried out of the cottage waiting for no further reply from Dan Morris or his wife

 If you please we will discuss the matter no further

 I think he said that I may perhaps best further the object which we must all have in view that namely of providing properly for the Sunday services in the church of Hogglestock by taking your reply personally to the bishop

 But in no case in this land is he that is subject bound to obey further than where the law gives authority and exacts obedience

 If you think more about the clergymen Lily and less about the church said Mrs Boyce very sententiously more about the matter and less about the manner more of the reality and less of the form I think you would find that your religion would go further with you

 Mr Crawley in answer to this had assured Mr Thumble that he would not be allowed to open his mouth in the church and Mr Thumble not seeing his way to any further successful action had contented himself with attending the services in his surplice making thereby a silent protest that he and not Mr Crawley ought to have been in the reading desk and the pulpit

 It is I think unavailing that I should further write to you my mind upon the subject as I possess such strong evidence that my written word will not be respected by you

 She understood how much louder a cock can crow in his own farmyard than elsewhere and knew that episcopal authority backed by all the solemn awe of palatial grandeur goes much further than it will do when sent under the folds of an ordinary envelope

 Then he showed signs of a desire to go upon his way without further parley

 He passed the turning going down to Framley with courage but when he came to the further turning by which the cart would return from Framley to the Hogglestock road he looked wistfully down the road for farmer Mangle

 I think we need fear no further disturbance Mr Crawley said to his wife and there was no further disturbance

 That evening as soon as Jane was in bed she resolved to ask him some further questions

 Mrs Crawley could ask no further questions on that evening

 But it seems to me that my affair as you call it Mr Robarts is of that nature that they who wish well to me will better further their wishes by silence than by any discussion

 But they both agreed that that message need not be sent any further

 Then Lily said nothing further but she observed that her mother only opened one of her letters at the breakfast table

 If you tell me to ask nothing further of course I will not

 Lily paused for some further answer from her mother but as Mrs Dale was silent she allowed that portion of the subject to pass as completed

 There was no reason why he should be ashamed of meeting Crosbie and yet when he saw him the blood mounted all over his face and he forgot to make any further search for Mr Musselbro

 He found that he could not very well explain this to a stranger and therefore at the moment he said nothing further

 Nobody was at home the servant said and then when the visitor began to make further inquiry the girl explained that the two young ladies had walked as far as Guestwick Cottage and that Mrs Dale was at this moment at the Great House with the squire

 He cannot have a friend that will go no further for him than I will

 And then Mr Robarts had left him fully convinced that any further interference on his part could be of no avail

 They did their best to make him comfortable and I think almost disappointed him in not heaping further misfortunes on his head

 As to most of Mrs Grantly s letters he never made any further inquiry

 Were she not to write at all or in writing to send no message from the father there would be cause for further anger

 I told him that so plainly that he can want no further intimation

 What should I have to think of myself if I allowed my heart to be altered by such a cause as that I have only further to say that I love you better than anyone in the world and that it is my best hope that you will be my wife

 I will not press you further till this affair of your father s has been settled but when that is over I shall look for my reward without reference to its result

 The entrance to this alley is beneath the first floor of one of the houses in the lane and in passing under this covered way the visitor to the place finds himself in a small paved square court at the two further corners of which there are two open doors for in Hook Court there are only two houses

 And I m to draw out every shilling that there is I ll see Mother Van further first

 And he reflected further that the more a fellow be down in the mouth the more good the amusement would do him

 CHAPTER XLII MR TOOGOOD TRAVELS PROFESSIONALLY Mr Toogood paid another visit to Barsetshire in order that he might get a little further information which he thought would be necessary before despatching his nephew upon the traces of Dean Arabin and his wife

 Perhaps before I go any further I ought to tell you that Mrs Crawley and I are first cousins

 No it was impossible to believe that Mr Crawley had in truth stolen a cheque for twenty pounds Mr Toogood could get no further information in Barchester and went on to Silverbridge early in the afternoon

 And then Mrs Walker whispered something further which we may presume to have been in intimation that the gentleman opposite Major Grantly was supposed by some people to be very fond of Miss Grace Crawley

 If the jury acquit him the bishop cannot proceed any further

 Now at the moment he would have been glad to get it from Mr Musselboro without further words for twenty

 Mr Gazebee had beaten him at litigation and his own lawyer had advised him that it would be foolish to try the matter further

 Would it not be well that he should put an end to himself and thus escape What was there in the world now for which it was worth his while to live Lily whom he had once gained and by that gain had placed himself high in all hopes of happiness and riches whom he had thrown away from him and who had again seemed to be almost within his reach Lily had so refused him that he knew not how to approach her with a further prayer

 To everybody I am everybody am I That is your idea of friendship You may be sure that after that I shall ask no further questions

 Such was the man who was rector of Silverbridge and rural dean in the district and who was now called upon by the bishop to assist him in making further inquiry as to this wretched cheque for twenty pounds

 When these ceremonies had been altogether completed and it was clearly necessary that something further should be done the bishop spoke Dr Tempest he said perhaps you will join me in my study at eleven

 And so saying he escaped from the lady without hearing her further remonstrance

 Then there had been further consultations at the deanery and it had been again agreed that it would be best to say nothing to him of his music

 My life is a blank and I almost think that nothing can hurt me further

 He was beginning to think what he would say in answer to the accusation now made when his eager ear caught the sound of her step upon the stairs and before the pause in conversation which the circumstances admitted had given place to the necessity for further speech Miss Van Siever had knocked at the door and had entered the room

 What is the worst of success That when won by merit it leads to further success for the gaining of which no merit is necessary

 I am afraid he will I am afraid he will said Sir Raffle and I fear my dear Miss Dale that I must go further than that

 Mr Dale as he got up to go away felt that he was beaten but he did not know how to carry the battle any further on that occasion

 She had promised her mother and John Eames that she would not do so and that promise would certainly have bound her without any further resolutions on her part

 Let that be as it might she would answer no more questions from him further than ordinary good breeding should require of her

 Mr Oriel said nothing further but Mark Robarts was aware that Mr Oriel did not quite approve of the visit

 It may suffice to say further now that the major did not see Grace again during his visit to Framley

 After this the archdeacon walked away and would not argue the matter any further with his wife at the moment

 He had on a former occasion taken upon himself to advise that Grace Crawley should not be entertained at Framley and now it seemed that he had come all the way from Plumstead to say something further in the same strain

 Lady Lufton if had anything further to say of that kind would listen to him as a matter of course

 He could not condescend however to give it further attention but passed on to the parsonage

 There would be no use in hurling further threats at him

 But when he suggested that probably it might be better in the present emergency to give up the idea of any further sitting in her room and proposed to send for his canvas colour box and easel she told him that as far as she was concerned he was welcome to have that one other sitting for which they had all bargained

 The hand a little further back if you don t mind he said and the wrist more turned towards me

 Should such adverse verdict unfortunately be given the bishop would hardly be justified in allowing a clergyman placed as you then would be placed to return to his cure after the expiration of such punishment as the judge might award without a further decision from an ecclesiastical court

 We are however clearly of the opinion that should the jury find themselves able to acquit you no further action whatsoever should be taken

 Now he resolved that he would go to Dr Tempest and that he would tell Dr Tempest that there was not occasion for any further inquiry

 Your letter came to hand yesterday morning Dr Tempest said Mr Crawley still standing though the doctor had pointed to a chair for him after shaking hands with him and having given yesterday to the consideration of it with what judgment I have been able to exercise I have felt it to be incumbent upon me to wait upon you without further delay as by doing so I may perhaps assist your views and save labour to those gentlemen who are joined with you in this commission of which you have spoken

 Mr Crawley sat down not on the chair indicated but on the further removed and at the other side of the table

 From Hoggle End he could hardly hope to pick up further lessons of wisdom

 If my mind were clear in this matter I would not budge an inch for any farmer no nor for any bishop further than he might by law compel me But my mind is not clear

 I have only further to ask your pardon for this long letter and to thank you again for the many and great marks of friendship which you have conferred on me

 Mrs Crawley led the major to the further window and there stood looking up into his face

 Then he went without saying a word further to Mr Crawley

 Why do you not speak to me There is nothing further to tell he said

 Then then She went no further in her speech but Dalrymple assented by a slight motion of his head and she had been informed sufficiently that her husband had perished by his own hand

 How she hated Mr Crawley for all the sorrow that he had brought upon her and her house And it was still the affair of Mr Crawley which urged her on to further action

 If it should happen that he goes into Barchester and is acquitted and comes back again the whole thing will be over and there will be no further interference in the parish

 A conquest of the archdeacon But Mr Robarts did not wish to have to explain anything further about the archdeacon

 I have been growing to feel for some weeks past that circumstances whether through my fault or not is an outside question as to which I will not further delay you by offering even an opinion that unfortunate circumstances have made me unfit to remain here as guardian of the souls of the people of this parish

 I cannot interfere further said Robarts

 No you cannot interfere further

 But he found that she had the clue in her hand and that the clue was one which required no further delicacy of investigation

 I had seen in Galignani something about a clergyman but I did not know what clergyman and I heard that there was something wrong about Mr Crawley s money but there has always been something wrong about money with poor Mr Crawley and as I knew that my husband had been written to also I did not interfere further than to ask the particulars

 Mary Walker not waiting for any further command from her father hurried out of the room to convey the secret to her special circle of friends

 Just come a little further he said I ve something special to tell you

 Then what the devil did you tell me To this further question the waiter sulkily declined to give any answer and soon afterwards left the room

 But Dan Stringer did not seem inclined to carry on the conversation any further

 There was no necessity that he should trouble the landlord any further

 Within an hour of this the major had arrived at Plumstead laden with the story of Mrs Arabin and the cheque and of Mr Crawley s innocence laden not only with such tidings as he had received from Mr Walker but also with further details which had received from Mr Toogood

 But the page who was accustomed to open the door for him was less false being young and would now tell him without any further fiction that Miss Madalina was in the drawing room

 And when she suggested that it might be expedient for the sake of the family that she should come back to Mr Bangles for further information at a subsequent period he very politely assured her that she would do him proud whenever she might please to call at Hook Court

 Lily cannot you say yes She did not answer him but walked further away from him to another window

 And I ll go further

 His Nelly as he used to call her had ever been his favourite and the circumstances of their joint lives had ever been such that they had never been further separated than from one street of Barchester to another and that only for a very short period of the married life of Mrs Arabin s first husband

 The East is always further than the West in the estimation of the Mrs Baxters of the world

 This Mr Crawley said very gravely looking neither to the right nor to the left nor at the face of any of them nor at his own garment nor hers but straight before him and when he had so spoken he said not a word further not going on to dilate on his poverty as the dean expected that he would do

 When Dr Filgrave called he was told that his services would be of no further use

 This was pretty from the husband to the wife as it regarded her father who had now gone from them and therefore Mrs Grantly accepted it without further argument

 Let me see what further he writes to me he then said and after that he continued the letter slowly to the end

 For the further instance of the friendship of the Dean of Barchester I am also thankful

 How the archdeacon conquered him may perhaps be best described by a further narration of what Mr Crawley told his wife

 Now the sight of this chateau had taken Raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little Louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time and every branch of oak every gilded weathercock on roof of slates reminded him that instead of returning to the friends of his childhood every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever

 Thank you and God reward you About half a mile from this on the same road there is an inn and about a mile further on after leaving the inn you will reach the village of Greney

 Not a step further he shouted the queen is signing What are you saying asked the queen

 Not a step further said the man who appeared to be the captain or I will hamstring your horses

 And now said D Artagnan to Athos entertain no further doubts about me I undertake all that concerns the king

 And setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea two strokes took the bark on twenty fathoms further

 I think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections

 Since your eminence has come so far come a few steps further conduct us my lord to the wall

 Friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by Aramis whose cunning you know a cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without egotism or by Athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself doesn t sympathize with the desires of others

 She said nothing further till the paroxysm was over then she continued more kindly I m not wishing you greater torment than I have Heathcliff

 When common words were less pleasing to the ear or less distinct in their signification I have familiarized the terms of philosophy by applying them to popular ideas but have rarely admitted any words not authorized by former writers for I believe that whoever knows the English tongue in its present extent will be able to express his thoughts without further help from other nations

 It is I think worthy of consideration whether since no wager is binding without a possibility of loss on each side it is not equally reasonable that no contract should be valid without reciprocal stipulations but in this case and others of the same kind what is stipulated on his side to whom the bond is given he takes advantage of the security neglects his affairs omits his duty suffers timorous wickedness to grow daring by degrees permits appetite to call for new gratifications and perhaps secretly longs for the time in which he shall have power to seize the forfeiture and if virtue or gratitude should prove too strong for temptation and a young man persist in honesty however instigated by his passions what can secure him at last against a false accusation I for my part always shall suspect that he who can by such methods secure his property will go one step further to increase it nor can I think that man safely trusted with the means of mischief who by his desire to have them in his hands gives an evident proof how much less he values his neighbour s happiness than his own

 I had built till the imagination of the architect was exhausted I had added one convenience to another till I knew not what more to wish or to design I had laid out my gardens planted my park and completed my water works and what now remained to be done what but to look up to turrets of which when they were once raised I had no further use to range over apartments where time was tarnishing the furniture to stand by the cascade of which I scarcely now perceived the sound and to watch the growth of woods that must give their shade to a distant generation

 At our first sally into the intellectual world we all march together along one straight and open road but as we proceed further and wider prospects open to our view every eye fixes upon a different scene we divide into various paths and as we move forward are still at a greater distance from each other

 But I tell you to go He was on the brink of saying something further then looked up at me suddenly and followed me up the ladder

 The colourless clearness that comes after the sunset flush was darkling the blue sky above grew momentarily deeper and the little stars one by one pierced the attenuated light the interspaces of the trees the gaps in the further vegetation that had been hazy blue in the daylight grew black and mysterious

 I increased my pace and after some time came to a slight ridge crossed it and turned sharply regarding it steadfastly from the further side

 A little point of light shone on the further bend of the curve and the grey sweep of the sandy beach lay faint under the starlight

 Still we would not say that they do not love God that they are not in many ways pleasing to Him but oh how many there are who only want a little more generosity to become Saints Then there is another class further on in their heavenward journey souls who do love God who do seek only to please Him who are generous often even noble hearted in their Master s service souls who can say Our Father and look up with child like love to Heaven but even with such and perhaps with almost all the feeling about Purgatory is much the same it is a sort of necessary evil a something that must be endured

 They were a long way further on than when she had lost consciousness and the waggon had stopped

 Where do you live What are you She gave him brief particulars and responding to further inquiries told him that she was intending to go back by the same carrier who had brought her

 He Pooh The old lady s face creased into furrows of repugnance and she made no further reply

 Mayn t I treat you as a lover She drew a quick pettish breath of objection writhing uneasily on her seat looked far ahead and murmured I don t know I wish how can I say yes or no when He settled the matter by clasping his arm round her as he desired and Tess expressed no further negative

 She said that she did not wish him to drive her further and they stopped just under the clump of trees

 Not seldom that long wandering unfits us for further travel and of what use is our experience to us then Tess Durbeyfield s experience was of this incapacitating kind

 Tess did not stop at Weatherbury after this long drive further than to make a slight nondescript meal at noon at a cottage to which the farmer recommended her

 Thence she started on foot basket in hand to reach the wide upland of heath dividing this district from the low lying meads of a further valley in which the dairy stood that was the aim and end of her day s pilgrimage

 At the further end the great churn could be seen revolving and its slip slopping heard the moving power being discernible through the window in the form of a spiritless horse walking in a circle and driven by a boy

 On the further side of Blackmoor Vale

 Before discussion of the question had proceeded further there walked round the corner of the settle into the full firelight of the apartment Mr Dairyman Crick Mrs Crick and two of the milkmaids

 Those words of his seemed to reassure her on further reflection

 She was whirled onward through the next couple of critical hours by the mastering tide of her devotion to him which closed up further meditation

 Her eyes filled as she regarded her position further she turned round and burst into a flood of self sympathetic tears

 Throbbingly alive as she was still under the stress of her mental grief the life beat so brokenly that a little further pull upon it would cause real illness dull her characteristic eyes and make her mouth thin

 Since the desperation of the night her activities had dropped to zero and there was no further rashness to be feared

 Its waters in creeping down these miles of meadowland frequently divided serpentining in purposeless curves looping themselves around little islands that had no name returning and re embodying themselves as a broad main stream further on

 There was no further difficulty

 Yet could a woman who had done even what she had done deserve all this But she could contest the point with him no further

 And O if you knew if you could only half know how I loved him how anxious I was to have him and how wrung I was between caring so much for him and my wish to be fair to him Tess was so shaken that she could get no further and sank a helpless thing into a chair

 Still further to screen her husband from any imputation on unkindness to her she took twenty five of the fifty pounds Clare had given her and handed the sum over to her mother as if the wife of a man like Angel Clare could well afford it saying that it was a slight return for the trouble and humiliation she had brought upon them in years past

 A hastily prepared supper was brought in and Clare made further exposition of his plans

 Well but Izz we ll part friends anyhow You don t know what I ve had to bear She was a really generous girl and allowed no further bitterness to mar their adieux

 Three miles further she cut across the straight and deserted Roman road called Long Ash Lane leaving which as soon as she reached it she dipped down a hill by a transverse lane into the small town or village of Evershead being now about halfway over the distance

 They said nothing however which particularly interested her till observing the young lady still further in front one of them remarked There is Mercy Chant

 The young lady still further ahead heard their footsteps and turned

 A pale distress was already on Tess s face and she pulled her curtained hood further over it

 Why souls above us your face is as if you d been hagrode It occurred to the good natured Marian that as Tess was so tired her discovery of her visitor s presence might have the bad effect of taking away her appetite and Marian was thinking of inducing Tess to descend by a ladder on the further side of the stack when the gentleman came forward and looked up

 I will take nothing from you either for them or for me He did not accompany her further since as she lived with the household all was public indoors

 Thus she proceeded mile after mile ascending and descending till she came to Bulbarrow and about midnight looked from that height into the abyss of chaotic shade which was all that revealed itself of the vale on whose further side she was born

 This done she paid him reducing herself to almost her last shilling thereby and he moved off and left them only too glad to get out of further dealings with such a family

 But let us try further on and get something for the dears to eat O Tess what s the use of your playing at marrying gentlemen if it leaves us like this Accompanied by Liza Lu and the boy she again ascended the little lane which secluded the church from the townlet

 Clare would not accept the loan of the farmer s vehicle for a further distance than to the outskirts of the Vale and sending it back with the man who had driven him he put up at an inn and next day entered on foot the region wherein was the spot of his dear Tess s birth

 It was apparent that Joan spoke the truth in this and he pressed her no further

 Well we might walk a few miles further and when it is evening find lodgings somewhere or other in a lonely cottage perhaps

 The door was reached a few steps further and one of the windows beside it was open

 They had proceeded thus gropingly two or three miles further when on a sudden Clare became conscious of some vast erection close in his front rising sheer from the grass

 Too free with MY boy Too free with everyone I forbore for the moment to analyze this description further than by the reflection that a part of it applied to several of the members of the household of the half dozen maids and men who were still of our small colony

 I quickened our step I wanted to get there before the question between us opened up much further I reflected hungrily that for more than an hour he would have to be silent and I thought with envy of the comparative dusk of the pew and of the almost spiritual help of the hassock on which I might bend my knees

 In the evening she came to a cottage among the hills and went in to rest for her little feet would carry her no further

 To induce further laudable inquiry and assist all those who may be willing to engage in the good work is the object of this preliminary work on the mortuary customs of North American Indians and it is hoped that many more laborers may through it be added to the extensive and honorable list of those who have already contributed

 In view of these facts it might seem almost a work of supererogation to continue a further examination of the subject for nearly every author in writing of our Indian tribes makes some mention of burial observances but these notices are scattered far and wide on the sea of this special literature and many of the accounts unless supported by corroborative evidence may be considered as entirely unreliable

 All were further adorned by spherical brass bells attached all about the borders by strings of beads

 This further arouses the suspicions of the musketeer who was made to look ridiculous by Aramis

 Certainly said he I have nothing further to say to a man who mistrusts me as you do

 Then monseigneur if you know that I must further add a fact of which you are ignorant that if the king were to know this evening of the presence of this musketeer this abbe this bishop this confessor here he who has risked everything to visit you to morrow would behold the steely glitter of the executioner s axe in a dungeon more gloomy more obscure than yours

 Aramis caused his companion to mount before him then followed and without giving the driver any further order Go on said he

 The matter is monseigneur said Aramis that before going further it is necessary your royal highness and I should converse

 I am listening said the young prince to Aramis but what are you doing there I am disarming myself of my pistols of which we have no further need monseigneur

 And understand them Pardon me but I may venture to ask that question of a poor abandoned captive of the Bastile In a week s time it will not be requisite to further question a mind like yours

 Fouquet what do you wish to be done with regard to him One moment more I entreat you monseigneur and forgive me if I seem to fail in respect to questioning you further

 The king read Mazarin s letter and as its contents are already known to the reader in consequence of the misunderstanding between Madame de Chevreuse and Aramis nothing further would be learned if we stated them here again

 Why not monseigneur Because if I were king I should make no further reply

 There is a further inequality he said continuing his work of temptation an inequality which concerns yourself monseigneur between the twins both sons of Louis XIII

 The prelate asked himself by what infernal machination his enemies had succeeded in depriving him of the means of going further he who never recognized chance as a deity who found a cause for every accident preferred believing that the refusal of the postmaster at such an hour in such a country was the consequence of an order emanating from above an order given with a view of stopping short the king maker in the midst of his flight

 As to the guards they penetrated further and further with exclamations that grew fainter as they advanced

 The eleven who remained out of sixteen imitated his example but they did not go further than the first

 In the further and lighter compartment Aramis stooping and concealed was busy with some mysterious maneuver

 Oh oh murmured he there is my weakness seizing me again I can walk no further What is this Aramis perceived him through the opening and unable to conceive what could induce him to stop thus Come on Porthos come on he cried come quickly Oh replied the giant making an effort that contorted every muscle of his body oh but I cannot

 Still further these men were my friends

 The momentary repose which this forgetfulness thus gave the body still further fatigued the soul for Athos lived a double life during these wanderings of his understanding

 But scarcely had his joyous servants dressed their master whom they saw with pleasure preparing for a journey which might dissipate his melancholy scarcely had the comte s gentlest horse been saddled and brought to the door when the father of Raoul felt his head become confused his legs give way and he clearly perceived the impossibility of going one step further

 Something said Athos wills that I should go no further

 He marched a few paces further and the two regiments clapped their hands

 Upon his brow was stamped a strength of will the expression of which already met no further contradiction in France and was soon to meet no more in Europe

 They threatened the elector they would wash out this stain in his blood and their sister s unless he either abandoned all further connexion with the countess or consented to re establish her reputation at the altar

 Could he have the weakness to listen to his fears and to betray the cause of religion and liberty This religion proclaims to him its own preponderance and the weakness of its rival two thirds of the power of Austria are now in arms against Austria itself while a formidable confederacy already formed in Transylvania would by a hostile attack further distract even the weak remnant of its power

 The domestic disturbances which his misgovernment had gradually excited burst forth under his unfortunate son and forced him after some unimportant attempts to renounce all further participation in the German war in order to stem within his own kingdom the rage of faction

 That then Maximilian may be rewarded Frederick must be further persecuted and totally ruined and to defray the expenses of the old war a new one must be commenced

 The execution of this sentence against Frederick namely the seizure of his lands was in further contempt of law committed to Spain as Sovereign of the circle of Burgundy to the Duke of Bavaria and the League

 As the Danish garrison already much reduced was unequal to the fatigues of this prolonged defence and the king was unable to detach any further troops to their support Stralsund with Christian s consent threw itself under the protection of the King of Sweden

 defeated in Germany had sought refuge in his own islands but the Baltic checked the further progress of the conquerors

 He further decided That by the religious peace Catholic proprietors of estates were no further bound to their Protestant subjects than to allow them full liberty to quit their territories

 The edict came like a thunderbolt on the whole of Protestant Germany dreadful even in its immediate consequences but yet more so from the further calamities it seemed to threaten

 In return for this pious concession the Capuchin dexterously counteracted the Emperor s scheme to procure for the King of Hungary the further dignity of King of the Romans

 In order to disperse them before they should receive any further reinforcement Arnheim advanced with part of his army from Prague and made a vigorous attack on their entrenchments near Limburg on the Elbe

 Placed between the Saxon and Swedish armies which were likely to be farther reinforced by the troops of George Duke of Luneburg from Lower Saxony he hastily retired upon Meresberg to form a junction there with Count Pappenheim and to repel the further advance of the Swedes

 History says nothing of prisoners a further proof of the animosity of the combatants who neither gave nor took quarter

 The most favourable circumstances combined to further the progress of the Swedish arms in this quarter when the operations of the army were at once stopped by a mutiny among the officers

 Wallenstein was Imperial Generalissimo in Germany but his command extended no further and he could not presume to exercise any authority over a foreign army

 Three of them Colonels Kinsky Terzky and Illo had long been in his secrets and the two first were further united to his interests by the ties of relationship

 But a rumour of the doings at Pilsen reached them on their journey and suddenly stopped their further progress

 There was also a further reason for avoiding a battle at present the enemy s force was likely soon to divide the Italian troops being destined for the Netherlands

 The neglected farms the destruction of the crops and the numerous armies which overran the exhausted country were inevitably followed by scarcity and the high price of provisions which in the later years was still further increased by a general failure in the crops

 That is to say I see no reason whatever to doubt firstly that Saul made such a visit and secondly that he and all who were present including the wise woman of Endor herself would have given with entire sincerity very much the same account of the business as that which we now read in the twenty eighth chapter of the first book of Samuel and I am further of opinion that this story is one of the most important of those fossils to which I have referred in the material which it offers for the reconstruction of the theology of the time

 If the story of Saul s consultation of the occult powers is to be regarded as an authentic narrative or at any rate as a statement which is perfectly veracious so far as the intention of the narrator goes and as I have said I see no reason for refusing it this character it will be found on further consideration to throw a flood of light both directly and indirectly on the theology of Saul s countrymen that is to say upon their beliefs respecting the nature and ways of spiritual beings

 It is further to be observed that the spirit or ghost of the dead man presents itself as the image of the man himself it is the man not merely in his ordinary corporeal presentment even down to the prophet s mantle but in his moral and intellectual characteristics

 Does this mean that Seth resembled Adam only in a spiritual and figurative sense And if that interpretation of the third verse of the fifth chapter of Genesis is absurd why does it become reasonable in the first verse of the same chapter But let us go further

 The absence of any real distinction between the Elohim of different ranks is further clearly illustrated by the corresponding absence of any sharp delimitation between the various kinds of people who serve as the media of communication between them and men

 When we further take into consideration that only in the reign of Hezekiah was the brazen serpent preserved in the temple and believed to be the work of Moses destroyed and the practice of offering incense to it that is worshipping it abolished that Jeroboam could set up calves of gold for Israel to worship with apparently none but a political object and certainly with no notion of creating a schism among the worshippers of Jahveh or of repelling the men of Judah from his standard it seems obvious either that the Israelites of the tenth and eleventh centuries B

 Further the evidence proves that this belief was the basis of the Jahveh worship to which Samuel and his followers were devoted that there is strong reason for believing and none for doubting that idolatry in the shape of the worship of the family gods or teraphim was practised by sincere and devout Jahveh worshippers that the ark with its protective tent or tabernacle was regarded as a specially but by no means exclusively favoured sanctuary of Jahveh that the ephod appears to have had a particular value for those who desired to divine by the help of Jahveh and that divination by lots was practised before Jahveh

 They further agreed with the old Israelites that all rewards for virtue and punishments for vice happen to men in this world only and come immediately from the gods vol

 It further appears that they decidedly belonged to the school of intuitive moral philosophers and believed that virtue is its own reward for quote Many of the chiefs on being asked by Mr

 But it is surely needless to carry the comparison further

 Of course a polytheistic and image worshipping people who observed a great many holy days but no Sabbaths could have nothing analogous to the first or the second and the fourth commandments of the Decalogue but answering to the third is I have not blasphemed to the fifth I have not reviled the face of the king or my father to the sixth I have not murdered to the seventh I have not committed adultery to the eighth I have not stolen I have not done fraud to man to the ninth I have not told falsehoods in the tribunal of truth and further I have not calumniated the slave to his master

 It is further well worth consideration whether indications of former ancestor worship are not to be found in the singular weight attached to the veneration of parents in the fourth commandment

 Yet within a year it became necessary to delay further reductions in the naval establishment and to impose new taxes to meet the very contingency which the peace loving President declared most remote

 Derne was to be evacuated and no further aid was to be given to rebellious subjects

 It had been waged in the spirit of not a cent for tribute it was concluded with a thinly veiled payment for peace and worst of all it did not prevent further trouble with the Barbary States

 Marbois intimated that he was not ignorant of the affair and invited Livingston to a further conversation

 Even granting that territory could be acquired there was the further question whether the treaty making power was competent irrespective of the House of Representatives

 The country awaited with eagerness those further details which the President had promised to set forth in another message

 Further interviews with the President and the Secretary of State did not mollify him for according to his version of these conversations he was informed that France would not permit Spain to adjust her differences with the United States which had therefore the alternative of paying France handsomely or of facing a war with both France and Spain

 But the shifty Burr would not commit himself further than to promise a satisfactory administration

 But Dayton added further details to the story which may have been intended only to intimidate Yrujo

 The Leopard then fired two shots across the bow of the Chesapeake and almost immediately without parleying further she was now within two hundred feet of her victim poured a broadside into the American vessel

 Only one gun was discharged and that was by means of a live coal brought up from the galley after the Chesapeake had received a third broadside and Commodore Barron had ordered the flag to be hauled down to spare further slaughter

 He then divulged little by little his further instructions which were such as no self respecting administration could listen to with composure

 He closed further negotiations with the comment that the United States could not be expected to make as it were an expiatory sacrifice to obtain redress or beg for reparation

 The Administration determined to let the disavowal of Berkeley suffice for the present and to allow the matter of reparation to await further developments

 The further he read the greater his ire so that when the President arrived in Washington October Jackson was fully resolved to let the American Government know what was due to a British Minister who had had audiences with most of the sovereigns of Europe

 The President then instructed the Secretary of State to announce that further discussions would be in the written form and henceforth himself took direct charge of negotiations

 Sir wrote the President still using the pen of his docile secretary finding that you have used a language which cannot be understood but as reiterating and even aggravating the same gross insinuation it only remains in order to preclude opportunities which are thus abused to inform you that no further communications will be received from you

 It alluded mildly to the need of a continuance of our defensive and precautionary arrangements and suggested further organization and training of the militia it contemplated with satisfaction the improvement of the quantity and quality of the output of cannon and small arms it set the seal of the President s approval upon the new military academy but nowhere did it sound a trumpet call to real preparedness

 The pretext for further action was soon given

 Late in January Gallatin and Bayard set off for Amsterdam the one to bide his chance to visit London the other to await further instructions

 Further delay followed for in spite of the assurances of Lord Castlereagh the British representatives did not make their appearance for a month

 And then without further formalities Goulburn stated in blunt and business like fashion the matters on which they had been instructed impressment fisheries boundaries the pacification of the Indians and the demarkation of an Indian territory

 Both commissions then agreed to appeal to their respective Governments for further instructions

 In comparison with this astounding proposal Lord Castlereagh s further suggestion of a rectification of the frontier by the cession of Fort Niagara and Sackett s Harbor and by the exclusion of the Americans from the Lakes seemed of little importance

 Russell agreeing in the objections of the two other gentlemen will be further for amending the construction of every sentence and Mr

 Veryreluctantly he then agreed to Gallatin s proposal to insert in a note rather than in the draft itself a paragraph to the effect that the commissioners were not instructed to discuss the rights hitherto enjoyed in the fisheries since no further stipulation was deemed necessary to entitle them to rights which were recognized by the treaty of 

 He penned a note rejecting the British offer because it seemed to imply the abandonment of a right but in turn he offered to omit in the treaty all reference to the fisheries and the Mississippi or to include a general reference to further negotiation of all matters still in dispute in such a way as not to relinquish any rights

 The Administration had every reason at this moment to wish to avoid further causes of irritation to Spanish pride

 If as many thought the Administration had delayed recognition of the South American republics in order not to offend Spanish feelings while the Florida treaty was under consideration it had now no excuse for further hesitation yet it was not until March that President Monroe announced to Congress his belief that the time had come when those provinces of Spain which had declared their independence and were in the enjoyment of it should be formally recognized

 Further communications from Baron Tuyll gave Adams the opportunity which he had once lost of enunciating the principles underlying American policy

 To this act of settlement President Monroe gave his assent for he believed that further controversy would shake the Union to its very foundations

 Kit who in despatching his bread and meat had been swallowing two thirds of his knife at every mouthful with the coolness of a juggler stopped short in his operations on being thus appealed to and bawled Nobody isn t such a fool as to say he doosn t after which he incapacitated himself for further conversation by taking a most prodigious sandwich at one bite

 Mr Swiveller drew back and nodded likewise then drew a little further back and nodded again and so on

 And now that I have carried this history so far in my own character and introduced these personages to the reader I shall for the convenience of the narrative detach myself from its further course and leave those who have prominent and necessary parts in it to speak and act for themselves

 Mr Quilp without changing his position further than to turn over a little more on his side and rest his chin on his hand proceeded to make himself acquainted with its contents

 The second perusal was to all appearance as unsatisfactory as the first and plunged him into a profound reverie from which he awakened to another assault upon his nails and a long stare at the child who with her eyes turned towards the ground awaited his further pleasure

 Poor Mrs Quilp was thinking however in what manner to begin or what kind of inquiries she could make and it was not until the door creaking in a very urgent manner warned her to proceed without further consideration that the sound of her voice was heard

 This undeveloped was the possibility which Richard Swiveller sought to conceal even from himself of his not being proof against the charms of Miss Wackles and in some unguarded moment by linking his fortunes to hers forever of putting it out of his own power to further their notable scheme to which he had so readily become a party

 The spot was at Chesea for there Miss Sophia Wackles resided with her widowed mother and two sisters in conjunction with whom she maintained a very small day school for young ladies of proportionate dimensions a circumstance which was made known to the neighbourhood by an oval board over the front first floor windows whereupon appeared in circumbmbient flourishes the words Ladies Seminary and which was further published and proclaimed at intervals between the hours of half past nine and ten in the morning by a straggling and solitrary young lady of tender years standing on the scraper on the tips of her toes and making futile attempts to reach the knocker with spelling book

 To this Ladies Seminary then Richard Swiveller hied with designs obnoxious to the peace of the fair Sophia who arrayed in virgin white embelished by no ornament but one blushing rose received him on his arrival in the midst of very elegant not to say brilliant preparations such as the embellishment of the room with the little flower pots which always stood on the window sill outside save in windy weather when they blew into the area the choice attire of the day scholars who were allowed to grace the festival the unwonted curls of Miss Jane Wackles who had kept her head during the whole of the preceding day screwed up tight in a yellow play bill and the solemn gentility and stately bearing of the old lady and her eldest daughter which struck Mr Swiveller as being uncommon but made no further impression upon him

 To this end Mr Quilp encamped in the back parlour having first put an effectual stop to any further business by shutting up the shop

 I shall remember it he had no excuse for dwelling on the subject any further and so took a friendly leave with many expressions of good will and many compliments to his friend on his looking so remarkably well and went below stairs to report progress to Mr Brass

 CHAPTER Daniel Quilp of Tower Hill and Sampson Brass of Bevis Marks in the city of London Gentleman one of her Majesty s attornies of the Courts of the King s Bench and Common Pleas at Westminster and a solicitor of the High Court of Chancery slumbered on unconscious and unsuspicious of any mischance until a knocking on the street door often repeated and gradually mounting up from a modest single rap to a perfect battery of knocks fired in long discharges with a very short interval between caused the said Daniel Quilp to struggle into a horizontal position and to stare at the ceiling with a drowsy indifference betokening that he heard the noise and rather wondered at the same and couldn t be at the trouble of bestowing any further thought upon the subject

 Fight for it you dogs or I ll wring its neck myself Without further persuasion the two boys fell upon each other tooth and nail while Quilp holding up the cage in one hand and chopping the ground with his knife in an ecstasy urged them on by his taunts and cries to fight more fiercely

 We must be further away a long long way further

 Further on further on darling further away if we walk till midnight

 Further away dear Nell pray further away

 N no further to night I think said the child looking towards her grandfather

 Rough or smooth said Mr Codlin beating his hand on the little footboard where Punch when suddenly struck with the symmetry of his legs and their capacity for silk stockings is accustomed to exhibit them to popular admiration rough or smooth I won t go further than the mile and a half to night

 Any further controversy being now out of the question Short was fain to part with Mr Grinder and his pupils and to follow his morose companion

 Now said Mr Garland when they had made some further inquiries of him I am not going to give you anything Thank you sir Kit replied and quite seriously too for this announcement seemed to free him from the suspicion which the Notary had hinted

 As they passed onward parting the boughs that clustered in their way the serenity which the child had first assumed stole into her breast in earnest the old man cast no longer fearful looks behind but felt at ease and cheerful for the further they passed into the deep green shade the more they felt that the tranquil mind of God was there and shed its peace on them

 Without further preface he conducted them into his little school room which was parlour and kitchen likewise and told them that they were welcome to remain under his roof till morning

 And indeed after scraping the dish all round with his knife and carrying the choice brown morsels to his mouth and after taking such a scientific pull at the stone bottle that by degrees almost imperceptible to the sight his head went further and further back until he lay nearly at his full length upon the ground this gentleman declared himself quite disengaged and came forth from his retreat

 One half of it that moiety in which the comfortable proprietress was then seated was carpeted and so partitioned off at the further end as to accommodate a sleeping place constructed after the fashion of a berth on board ship which was shaded like the little windows with fair white curtains and looked comfortable enough though by what kind of gymnastic exercise the lady of the caravan ever contrived to get into it was an unfathomable mystery

 In whatever way Mrs Jarley received the response it did not provoke her to further questioning or tempt her into any more remarks at the time for she relapsed into a thoughtful silence and remained in that state so long that Nell withdrew to the other window and rejoined her grandfather who was now awake

 Here was the old passion awakened again in her grandfather s breast and to what further distraction it might tempt him Heaven only knew

 Mr Brass not caring as it seemed to pursue the subject any further they both plied their pens at a great pace and there the discussion ended

 Nothing further passed up to Mr Swiveller s dinner time which was at three o clock and seemed about three weeks in coming

 As he said nothing further and declined taking the hint Mr Brass was fain to propose that they should go up stairs together and make a last effort to awaken the sleeper by some less violent means which if they failed on this last trial must positively be succeeded by stronger measures

 This gave him a rakish eccentric air which now that he had leisure to observe it charmed Mr Swiveller exceedingly therefore by way of propitiation he expressed his hope that the gentleman was going to get up and further that he would never do so any more

 He also gave them to understand that the cooking apparatus roasted a fine piece of sirloin of beef weighing about six pounds avoir dupoise in two minutes and a quarter as he had himself witnessed and proved by his sense of taste and further that however the effect was produced he had distinctly seen water boil and bubble up when the single gentleman winked from which facts he Mr Swiveller was led to infer that the lodger was some great conjuror or chemist or both whose residence under that roof could not fail at some future days to shed a great credit and distinction on the name of Brass and add a new interest to the history of Bevis Marks

 Go further away from the leg of mutton or you ll be picking it I know said Miss Sally

 Their entertainer had sat perfectly quiet in the beginning of this dispute looking first at one man and then at the other as if he were lying in wait for an opportunity of putting some further question or reverting to that from which the discourse had strayed

 Finally Kit informed the gentleman that the premises were now to let and that a board upon the door referred all inquirers to Mr Sampson Brass Solicitor of Bevis Marks from whom he might perhaps learn some further particulars

 Now it happened that the gentleman in his anxiety to impress upon Kit that he was not to tell anybody what had passed between them followed him out to the door to repeat his caution and it further happened that at that moment the eyes of Mr Richard Swiveller were turned in that direction and beheld his mysterious friend and Kit together

 Barbara tripping off to do as she was bid he turned to Kit and said that they would not pursue the subject any further and that Kit could not be more unwilling to part with them than they would be to part with Kit a sentiment which the old lady very generously echoed

 As to plunder cried the fellow raising his voice Damme what do you mean by such ungentlemanly language as plunder eh The speaker laid himself down again at full length and gave one or two short angry kicks as if in further expression of his unbounded indignation

 Where have you come from was the next question and this being an easier one to answer Nell mentioned the name of the village in which their friend the schoolmaster dwelt as being less likely to be known to the men or to provoke further inquiry

 Please God we shall be there soon to morrow or next day at the farthest and in the meantime let us think dear that it was a good thing we came here for we are lost in the crowd and hurry of this place and if any cruel people should pursue us they could surely never trace us further

 Without waiting for any further reply than he saw in their looks he took Nell in his arms and bade the old man follow

 Of this determination Mr Quilp expressed his high approval and setting himself in the same breath to goad Mr Swiveller on to further hints soon made out that the single gentleman had been seen in communication with Kit and that this was the secret which was never to be disclosed

 Possessed of this piece of information Mr Quilp directly supposed that the single gentleman above stairs must be the same individual who had waited on him and having assured himself by further inquiries that this surmise was correct had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that the intent and object of his correspondence with Kit was the recovery of his old client and the child

 CHAPTER Kit s mother might have spared herself the trouble of looking back so often for nothing was further from Mr Quilp s thoughts than any intention of pursuing her and her son or renewing the quarrel with which they had parted

 Quilp looked at his companion with his eyes screwed up into a comical expression of curiosity and patiently awaited his further explanation upon which however Mr Swiveller appeared in no hurry to enter as he ate a very long dinner in profound silence finally pushed away his plate threw himself back into his chair folded his arms and stared ruefully at the fire in which some ends of cigars were smoking on their own account and sending up a fragrant odour

 She added in the same breath as if fearful of any further questioning But please will you leave a card or message These unusual answers might naturally have provoked some more inquiries

 In like manner when the aforesaid antiquaries did argue and contend that a certain secret vault was not the tomb of a grey haired lady who had been hanged and drawn and quartered by glorious Queen Bess for succouring a wretched priest who fainted of thirst and hunger at her door the bachelor did solemnly maintain against all comers that the church was hallowed by the said poor lady s ashes that her remains had been collected in the night from four of the city s gates and thither in secret brought and there deposited and the bachelor did further being highly excited at such times deny the glory of Queen Bess and assert the immeasurably greater glory of the meanest woman in her realm who had a merciful and tender heart

 Mr Swiveller expressed his acknowledgments and it appearing on further conversation that he was in good health and that Mr Chuckster was in the like enviable condition both gentlemen in compliance with a solemn custom of the ancient Brotherhood to which they belonged joined in a fragment of the popular duet of All s Well with a long shake at the end

 Mr Chuckster being roused would probably have pursued this subject further and in more emphatic language but for a tap at the door which seeming to announce the arrival of somebody on business caused him to assume a greater appearance of meekness than was perhaps quite consistent with his late declaration

 The air was Away with melancholy a composition which when it is played very slowly on the flute in bed with the further disadvantage of being performed by a gentleman but imperfectly acquainted with the instrument who repeats one note a great many times before he can find the next has not a lively effect

 In the space between sat a turnkey reading a newspaper and outside the further railing Kit saw with a palpitating heart his mother with the baby in her arms Barbara s mother with her never failing umbrella and poor little Jacob staring in with all his might as though he were looking for the bird or the wild beast and thought the men were mere accidents with whom the bars could have no possible concern

 Sampson Brass who was by this time anything but sober being compelled to take further draughts of the same strong bowl found that instead of at all contributing to his recovery they had the novel effect of making the counting house spin round and round with extreme velocity and causing the floor and ceiling to heave in a very distressing manner

 The face horribly seared by the frequent application of the red hot poker and further ornamented by the insertion in the tip of the nose of a tenpenny nail yet smiled blandly in its less lacerated parts and seemed like a sturdy martyr to provoke its tormentor to the commission of new outrages and insults

 And in further assurance that he s safe and sound Kit speaks to her again and then Barbara goes off into another fit of laughter and then into another fit of crying and then Barbara s mother and Kit s mother nod to each other and pretend to scold her but only to bring her to herself the faster bless you and being experienced matrons and acute at perceiving the first dawning symptoms of recovery they comfort Kit with the assurance that she ll do now and so dismiss him to the place from whence he came

 How he had written for such further information as would put the fact beyond all doubt how it had that morning arrived had confirmed his first impression into a certainty and was the immediate cause of that journey being planned which they were to take to morrow

 To work this sportive vein still further Mr Brass by his counsel moved in arrest of judgment that he had been led to criminate himself by assurances of safety and promises of pardon and claimed the leniency which the law extends to such confiding natures as are thus deluded

 I just remember I got into the room for I knew nothing further of the matter till afterwards for I fell into a fit with my terror and there I lay till he as I suppose looking through the key hole spyed me upon the floor stretched out at length on my face and then he called Mrs

 As I may not have opportunity to send again soon and yet as I know you keep my letters and read them over and over so John told me when you have done work so much does your kindness make you love all that comes from your poor daughter and as it may be some little pleasure to me perhaps to read them myself when I am come to you to remind me of what I have gone through and how great God s goodness has been to me which I hope will further strengthen my good resolutions that I may not hereafter from my bad conduct have reason to condemn myself from my own hand as it were For all these reasons I say I will write as I have time and as matters happen and send the scribble to you as I have opportunity and if I don t every time in form subscribe as I ought I am sure you will always believe that it is not for want of duty

 Ay said the good old man I am sorry for that too But sir No more I say said my master for my reputation is so well known mighty fine thought I that I care not what any body writes or says of me But to tell you the truth not that it need go further I think of changing my condition soon and you know young ladies of birth and fortune will choose their own servants and that s my chief reason why Pamela can t stay

 She would have made me write on a little further

 But I will not enlarge any further than to assure you that I am to the best of my power Your faithful friend and servant ARTHUR WILLIAMS

 Jewkes at top You ought in manners to have read no further

 A projected contrivance of mine to get away out of the window and by the back door and throwing by petticoat and handkerchief into the pond to amuse them while I got off An attempt that had like to have ended very dreadfully for me My further concern for Mr

 I have heart enough sir to do a deed that would make you regret using me thus and I can hardly bear it and what I am further to undergo

 To be sure she must be an atheist Do you think she is not We could not reach further than this little poor place and sad alehouse rather than inn for it began to be dark and Robin did not make so much haste as he might have done and he was forced to make hard shift for his horses

 If you are the generous Pamela I imagine you to be for hitherto you have been all goodness where it has not been merited let me see by this new instance the further excellence of your disposition let me see you can forgive the man who loves you more than himself let me see by it that you are not prepossessed in any other person s favour And one instance more I would beg and then I am all gratitude and that is that you would despatch Monsieur Colbrand with a letter to your father assuring him that all will end happily and to desire that he will send to you at my house the letters you found means by Williams s conveyance to send him

 O sir said I I am out of breath with the thoughts of my danger But what good angel prevented the execution of this deep laid design Why your good angel Pamela said he for when I began to consider that it would have made you miserable and me not happy that if you should have a dear little one it would be out of my own power to legitimate it if I should wish it to inherit my estate and that as I am almost the last of my family and most of what I possess must descend to a strange line and disagreeable and unworthy persons notwithstanding that I might in this case have issue of my own body when I further considered your untainted virtue what dangers and trials you had undergone by my means and what a world of troubles I had involved you in only because you were beautiful and virtuous which had excited all my passion for you and reflected also upon your tried prudence and truth I though I doubted not effecting this my last plot resolved to overcome myself and however I might suffer in struggling with my affection for you to part with you rather than to betray you under so black a veil

 On all these considerations it was that I rejected this project and sent word to the person that I had better considered of the matter and would not have him come till he heard further from me And in this suspense I suppose some of your confederates Pamela for we have been a couple of plotters though your virtue and merit have procured you faithful friends and partisans which my money and promises could hardly do one way or other got knowledge of it and gave you this notice but perhaps it would have come too late had not your white angel got the better of my black one and inspired me with resolutions to abandon the project just as it was to have been put into execution

 All that followed was so kind on his side being our chariot conference as above on Wednesday morning and how good he has been ever since that I thought I would go no further for I was a little ashamed to be so very open on that tender and most grateful subject though his great goodness to me deserves all the acknowledgments I can possibly make

 And I stept out of my chariot to walk across this meadow and bid Robin meet me with it on the further part of it And whom should I spy there walking with a book in his hand reading but your humble servant Mr

 He asked me if it was not too great a favour No said I don t talk of that let us walk to the further opening there and we shall meet my chariot

 And give me leave further to say sir that though I tell you sincerely my thoughts were I only to consider myself yet when I consider her good and her merit I should be highly ungenerous were it put to my choice if I could not wish her in a condition so much superior to what I could raise her to and so very answerable to her merit

 Now good sir said I oblige me don t read any further pray don t O pray madam said Mr

 Nor have I any request to make but that you will forgive all my imperfections and among the rest this foolish weakness that makes me seem to you after all the generous things that have passed to want this further condescension and these kind assurances

 Have you any thing further said he

 And now let me know what my Pamela has further to wish O my dearest sir said I not a single wish more has your grateful Pamela My heart is overwhelmed with your goodness Forgive these tears of joy added I You have left me nothing to pray for but that God will bless you with life and health and honour and continue to me the blessing of your esteem and I shall then be the happiest creature in the world

 Jervis which I will send with the further occurrences when I go to the other dear house or give you when I see you as I now hope soon to do

 And how often have I experienced this in my good lady s time though but the second hand dispenser of her benefits to the poor and sickly when she made me her almoner How have I been affected with the blessings which the miserable have heaped upon her for her goodness and upon me for being but the humble conveyer of her bounty to them And how delighted have I been when the moving report I have made of a particular distress has augmented my good lady s first intentions in relief of it This I recall with pleasure because it is now by the divine goodness become my part to do those good things she was wont to do And oh let me watch myself that my prosperous state do not make me forget to look up with due thankfulness to the Providence which has entrusted me with the power that so I may not incur a terrible woe by the abuse or neglect of it Forgive me these reflections my dear parents and let me have your prayers that I may not find my present happiness a snare to me but that I may consider that more and more will be expected from me in proportion to the power given me and that I may not so unworthily act as if I believed I ought to set up my rest in my mean self and think nothing further to be done with the opportunities put into my hand by the divine favour and the best of men Saturday seven o clock in the evening

 There is a pretty little farm and house untenanted upon that estate and tolerably well stocked and I will further stock it for them for such industrious folks won t know how to live without some employment And it shall be theirs for both their lives without paying any rent and I will allow them l

 O no sir said I and I fear almost sinned in my grateful flight I am sure they would not choose that they could not perhaps serve God so well if they were to live with you For so constantly seeing the hand that blesses them they would it may be as must be my care to avoid be tempted to look no further in their gratitude than to the dear dispenser of such innumerable benefits

 And miss said she you may pull off your gloves and lay your fan by for you shan t go and if you behave well you shall wait upon me at dinner and then I shall have a little further talk with you

 And palliating her cruel usage and beginning I suppose to think herself she had carried it further than she could answer it to her brother she wanted to lay the fault upon me

 Lady Jones wished to hear a further account of my lady s conduct and most of the company joined with her particularly Mrs

 The company were so kindly pleased with our concern and my dear master s goodness that he observing their indulgence and being himself curious to know the further particulars of what had passed between my lady and me repeated his question What she had called me besides wench and creature And I said My lady supposing I was wicked lamented over me very kindly my depravity and fall and said What a thousand pities it was so much virtue as she was pleased to say was so destroyed and that I had yielded after so noble a stand as she said

 So to be short I saw nothing was to be done and I feared sir you would wonder at my stay and be angry and I watched my opportunity till my lady who was walking about the room was at the further end and the parlour being a ground floor in a manner I jumped out at the window and ran for it

 Tis your own fault if you go further

 Next we are to be indulged in every thing at school and our masters and mistresses are rewarded with further grateful instances of our boisterous behaviour

 I ll be further if I do

 Well Pamela said he now can you allow me to love this little innocent Allow you sir replied I you would be very barbarous if you did not and I should be more so if I did not further it all I could and love the little lamb myself for your sake and for her own sake and in compassion to her poor mother though unknown to me And tears stood in my eyes

 For sir I doubt you would have proceeded with your temptations if she had not gone and it shewed she was much in earnest to be good that she could leave her native country leave all her relations leave you whom she so well loved leave her dear baby and try a new fortune in a new world among quite strangers and hazard the seas and all to preserve herself from further guiltiness Indeed indeed sir said I I bleed for what her distresses must be in this case I am grieved for her poor mind s remorse through her childbed terrors which could have so great and so worthy an effect upon her afterwards and I honour her resolution and would rank such a returning dear lady in the class of those who are most virtuous and doubt not God Almighty s mercy to her and that her present happiness is the result of his gracious providence blessing her penitence and reformation

 Several poor people begged my charity and I beckoned John with my fan and said Divide in the further church porch that money to the poor and let them come to morrow morning to me and I will give them something more if they don t importune me now

 I bowed to him but I could have wished him further to make me sit so in the notice of every one which for all I could do dashed me not a little

 When the gentlemen can think of nothing new and can go no further they quickly call in a diminished seventh chord to help them out of the predicament

 Czerny says further of his playing In rapidity of scale passages trills leaps etc

 When I must antagonize others I do no more than is necessary to protect myself against them or prevent them from doing further evil

 The boundaries are not yet fixed which shall call out to talent and industry thus far and no further Reported by Schindler

 And a further reason for caution in this respect might be drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that those who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists

 The public debt of the Union would be a further cause of collision between the separate States or confederacies

 A further resource for influencing the conduct of European nations toward us in this respect would arise from the establishment of a federal navy

 It is therefore evident that one national government would be able at much less expense to extend the duties on imports beyond comparison further than would be practicable to the States separately or to any partial confederacies

 The arrangements that may be necessary for those angles and fractions of our territory which lie on our northwestern frontier must be left to those whom further discoveries and experience will render more equal to the task

 In the sequel of the inquiry through which I propose to accompany you the truths intended to be inculcated will receive further confirmation from facts and arguments hitherto unnoticed

 This language at the present day would appear as wild as a great part of what we now hear from the same quarter will be thought when we shall have received further lessons from that best oracle of wisdom experience

 A concise review of the events that have attended confederate governments will further illustrate this important doctrine an inattention to which has been the great source of our political mistakes and has given our jealousy a direction to the wrong side

 As a further provision for the efficacy of the federal powers they took an oath mutually to defend and protect the united cities to punish the violators of this oath and to inflict vengeance on sacrilegious despoilers of the temple

 Nothing would be further from the reality

 The hope of a still further increase afforded an inducement to those who were disposed to serve to procrastinate their enlistment and disinclined them from engaging for any considerable periods

 The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered For the Independent Journal

 Disappointed in his first surmise the person I have supposed would be apt to pursue his conjectures a little further

 The Same Subject Continued The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered From the New York Packet

 I will in this place hazard an observation which will not be the less just because to some it may appear new which is that the more the operations of the national authority are intermingled in the ordinary exercise of government the more the citizens are accustomed to meet with it in the common occurrences of their political life the more it is familiarized to their sight and to their feelings the further it enters into those objects which touch the most sensible chords and put in motion the most active springs of the human heart the greater will be the probability that it will conciliate the respect and attachment of the community

 The great extent of the country is a further security

 This restriction implies an admission that if it were not inserted the States would possess the power it excludes and it implies a further admission that as to all other taxes the authority of the States remains undiminished

 It is indeed possible that a tax might be laid on a particular article by a State which might render it INEXPEDIENT that thus a further tax should be laid on the same article by the Union but it would not imply a constitutional inability to impose a further tax

 In this view of the subject by what logic can it be maintained that the local governments ought to command in perpetuity an EXCLUSIVE source of revenue for any sum beyond the extent of two hundred thousand pounds To extend its power further in EXCLUSION of the authority of the Union would be to take the resources of the community out of those hands which stood in need of them for the public welfare in order to put them into other hands which could have no just or proper occasion for them

 There remain a few other lights in which this important subject of taxation will claim a further consideration

 The quantity of taxes to be paid by the community must be the same in either case with this advantage if the provision is to be made by the Union that the capital resource of commercial imposts which is the most convenient branch of revenue can be prudently improved to a much greater extent under federal than under State regulation and of course will render it less necessary to recur to more inconvenient methods and with this further advantage that as far as there may be any real difficulty in the exercise of the power of internal taxation it will impose a disposition to greater care in the choice and arrangement of the means and must naturally tend to make it a fixed point of policy in the national administration to go as far as may be practicable in making the luxury of the rich tributary to the public treasury in order to diminish the necessity of those impositions which might create dissatisfaction in the poorer and most numerous classes of the society

 When we pass from the works of nature in which all the delineations are perfectly accurate and appear to be otherwise only from the imperfection of the eye which surveys them to the institutions of man in which the obscurity arises as well from the object itself as from the organ by which it is contemplated we must perceive the necessity of moderating still further our expectations and hopes from the efforts of human sagacity

 Let us further suppose that their country should concur both in this favorable opinion of their merits and in their unfavorable opinion of the convention and should accordingly proceed to form them into a second convention with full powers and for the express purpose of revising and remoulding the work of the first

 Could any further proof be required of the republican complexion of this system the most decisive one might be found in its absolute prohibition of titles of nobility both under the federal and the State governments and in its express guaranty of the republican form to each of the latter

 The act from Annapolis recommends the appointment of commissioners to take into consideration the situation of the United States to devise SUCH FURTHER PROVISIONS as shall appear to them necessary to render the Constitution of the federal government ADEQUATE TO THE EXIGENCIES OF THE UNION and to report such an act for that purpose to the United States in Congress assembled as when agreed to by them and afterwards confirmed by the legislature of every State will effectually provide for the same

 From these two acts it appears st that the object of the convention was to establish in these States A FIRM NATIONAL GOVERNMENT d that this government was to be such as would be ADEQUATE TO THE EXIGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT and THE PRESERVATION OF THE UNION d that these purposes were to be effected by ALTERATIONS AND PROVISIONS IN THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION as it is expressed in the act of Congress or by SUCH FURTHER PROVISIONS AS SHOULD APPEAR NECESSARY as it stands in the recommendatory act from Annapolis th that the alterations and provisions were to be reported to Congress and to the States in order to be agreed to by the former and confirmed by the latter

 Must it of necessity be admitted that this power is infringed so long as a part of the old articles remain Those who maintain the affirmative ought at least to mark the boundary between authorized and usurped innovations between that degree of change which lies within the compass of ALTERATIONS AND FURTHER PROVISIONS and that which amounts to a TRANSMUTATION of the government

 As this objection therefore has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention I dismiss it without further observation

 The Powers Conferred by the Constitution Further Considered From the New York Packet

 The provision of the federal articles on the subject of piracies and felonies extends no further than to the establishment of courts for the trial of these offenses

 The Same Subject Continued The Powers Conferred by the Constitution Further Considered For the Independent Journal

 This consideration has the more weight as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the stationary residence of the government would be both too great a public pledge to be left in the hands of a single State and would create so many obstacles to a removal of the government as still further to abridge its necessary independence

 But the authority extends no further than to a GUARANTY of a republican form of government which supposes a pre existing government of the form which is to be guaranteed

 They may be further told that every constitution must limit its precautions to dangers that are not altogether imaginary and that no real danger can exist that the government would DARE with or even without this constitutional declaration before it to remit the debts justly due to the public on the pretext here condemned

 It is needless therefore to remark further on this head than that the manner in which the restraint is qualified seems well calculated at once to secure to the States a reasonable discretion in providing for the conveniency of their imports and exports and to the United States a reasonable check against the abuse of this discretion

 Had they attempted to enumerate the particular powers or means not necessary or proper for carrying the general powers into execution the task would have been no less chimerical and would have been liable to this further objection that every defect in the enumeration would have been equivalent to a positive grant of authority

 Were the federal Constitution therefore really chargeable with the accumulation of power or with a mixture of powers having a dangerous tendency to such an accumulation no further arguments would be necessary to inspire a universal reprobation of the system

 The reasons on which Montesquieu grounds his maxim are a further demonstration of his meaning

 It may even be necessary to guard against dangerous encroachments by still further precautions

 What effect may be produced by this partial reform must be left to further experience

 But fortunately the Constitution has provided a still further safeguard

 But this principle can extend no further than to those circumstances and interests to which the authority and care of the representative relate

 There remains a further consideration which will not a little strengthen this conclusion

 Objections to the Power of the Senate To Set as a Court for Impeachments Further Considered From the New York Packet

 If any further arguments were necessary to evince the improbability of such a bias it might be found in the nature of the agency of the Senate in the business of appointments

 I venture somewhat further and hesitate not to affirm that if the manner of it be not perfect it is at least excellent

 The Executive Department Further Considered From the New York Packet

 The Executive Department Further Considered From the New York Packet

 But the power in question has a further use

 And when we proceed still one step further and look forward to the probable augmentation of the Senate by the erection of new States we shall not only perceive ample ground of confidence in the sufficiency of the members to whose agency that power will be intrusted but we shall probably be led to conclude that a body more numerous than the Senate would be likely to become would be very little fit for the proper discharge of the trust

 There is yet a further and a weightier reason for the permanency of the judicial offices which is deducible from the nature of the qualifications they require

 I mean not therefore to contend that the United States in the course of legislation upon the objects intrusted to their direction may not commit the decision of causes arising upon a particular regulation to the federal courts solely if such a measure should be deemed expedient but I hold that the State courts will be divested of no part of their primitive jurisdiction further than may relate to an appeal and I am even of opinion that in every case in which they were not expressly excluded by the future acts of the national legislature they will of course take cognizance of the causes to which those acts may give birth

 But let us further suppose that in a subsequent part of the same act it should be declared that no woman should dispose of any estate of a determinate value without the consent of three of her nearest relations signified by their signing the deed could it be inferred from this regulation that a married woman might not procure the approbation of her relations to a deed for conveying property of inferior value The position is too absurd to merit a refutation and yet this is precisely the position which those must establish who contend that the trial by juries in civil cases is abolished because it is expressly provided for in cases of a criminal nature

 In Connecticut therefore the trial by jury extends in PRACTICE further than in any other State yet mentioned

 Independent of those which relate to the structure of the government we find the following Article section clause Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor trust or profit under the United States but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment trial judgment and punishment according to law

 I go further and affirm that bills of rights in the sense and to the extent in which they are contended for are not only unnecessary in the proposed Constitution but would even be dangerous

 But there is yet a further consideration which proves beyond the possibility of a doubt that the observation is futile

 We have I think just time to catch our train at Paddington and I will go further into the matter upon our journey

 Still I must ask you to humor me a little further

 There is a further point however which is subtler and of greater interest

 But we may sleep on it now for I shall be surprised if we do not hear something further from Brook Street in the morning

 Excuse me a moment and I may be able to give you some further information about it

 Is there anything further which I can explain Dr

 I ll plunge into the matter without further preamble

 It is of enormous importance that nothing further should leak out

 You said you had a clue Well we have several but we can only test their value by further inquiry

 I have not the heart to interrupt your breakfast any further and yet I am dying to know how you got it and where it was

 I must apologize for calling so late said he and I must further beg you to be so unconventional as to allow me to leave your house presently by scrambling over your back garden wall

 When he saw her beauty and loveliness he fell in love with her and said to her Harkye Do thou take me to mate and I will be tender to thee and use thee with exceeding ruth and I will further thee in obedience to Allah Almighty

 But she answered saying I have no need of wedlock and I desire to abide here alone with my Lord and His worship but an thou wouldst have ruth upon me and further me in the obedience of Allah the Most High carry me to a place where there is water and thou wilt have done me a kindness

 When the young woman my wife saw me in this plight she said to me O man tell me thy tale for by Allah if I may effect thy deliverance I will assuredly further thee thereto

 So before leaving home he commended her to the care of his brother and besought him to aid her in her affairs and further her wishes till he should return for the brothers were on the most intimate terms

 FN Now the road which they would have followed was crossed by a sea arm but it was shallow and scant of water wherefore when they reached that place the king took up one of his children and fording the water with him set him down on the further bank and returned for his other son whom also he seated by his brother

 Quoth she I will not trust to thy word but will go with thee and help thee to whatso thou wishest and further thee myself therein

 And if it affects many other men and women as it affects you and if it lives with power from one generation to another gladdening the children as it gladdened the fathers then surely it is great literature without further qualification or need of definition

 Illustration A STREET IN CAERLEON ON USK The traditional home of King Arthur Malory s spirit is further indicated by the fact that he passed over all extravagant tales of foreign heroes and used only the best of the Arthurian romances

 As the best of Malory s work is now easily accessible we forbear further quotation

 Nay he dooth as if your journey should be through a faire vineyard at the first give you a cluster of grapes that full of that taste you may long to passe further

 In reality their source was no further distant than her own heart and their hero was seen across the breakfast table every morning

 Further examination of these minor poems shows them to be filled with sentiment that often slips over the verge of sentimentality

 Well Sir Ralph I rede thee if thou comest unhurt to Higham on the Way go no further for this time but take service with the lord abbot and be one of his men of war thou may st then become his captain if thou shouldest live which would be no bad adventure for one who cometh from Upmeads

 Ralph looked no brighter for this word and he answered nought to it but said presently And what is to be looked for beyond Higham if one goeth further Dost thou know the land any further The carle smiled Yea forsooth and down to the Wood Perilous and beyond it and the lands beyond the Wood and far away through them

 Again some two miles further on Ralph met a flock of sheep coming down a bent which the road climbed and with them were three men their drovers and they drew nigh him as he was amidst of the sheep so that he could scarce see the way

 No foot further will I go said Ralph till ye loose the woman and let her go or else tell me what her worst deed is

 By your leave Sir Gentleman said the carle we will go a few yards further on where there is a woodland brook whereof we may drink when my bottle faileth

 Then came they to a thorp of the smallest on a rising ground from the further end of which they could see the walls and towers of the Burg

 But they entered it along with men bringing wares into the town and none heeded them much till they came to the very gate on the further side of a moat that was both deep and clean but as now the bridge was down and the portcullis up so that the market people might pass in easily for it was yet early in the day

 And further let alone that it is not ill to be sundered from yonder company who mayhap will have rough work to do or ever they win home I have nought to do to bring thee to Hampton under Scaur if thou hast no will to go thither though certes I would lead thee some whither whereof thou shalt ask me nought as now yet will I say thereof this much that there thou shalt be both safe and well at ease

 But after a while they came upon a ridge somewhat high on the further side whereof was a wide valley well grassed and with few trees and no habitation of man that they might see

 On the further side they clomb up a hill somewhat steep at the crown they drew rein to give their horses breath and Ralph turned in his saddle and looked down on to the valley and as aforesaid he was clear sighted and far sighted now he said Fellow farer I see the riding of folk down below there and meseems they be spurring toward the water and they have weapons there dost thou not see the gleam I will take thy word for it fair sir said Roger and will even spur since they be the first men whom we have seen since we left the thickets

 Now was Ralph so full of wonder that he scarce knew what to say but he bethought him of that fair waste on the other side of the forest the country through which that wide river flowed so he said And that land north away beyond the wildwood canst thou tell me the tale of its wars and if it were wasted in the same wars that tormented this land The carle shook his head As to the land beyond this wood quoth he I know nought of it for beyond the wood go we never nay most often we go but a little way into it no further than we can see the glimmer of the open daylight through its trees the daylight of the land of Abundance that is enough for us

 And now he saw that there were folk come before him on this green place and keen sighted as he was could make out that three men were on the hither side of the oak trees and on the further side of them was a white horse

 Yet a little further and it grew lighter still and he heard the throstles singing a little way off and knew that they were on the edge of the pine wood and still her swift feet sped on till they came to a little grassy wood lawn with nought anear it on the side away from the wood save maples and thorn bushes it was broad daylight there though the sun had not yet arisen

 Further as I grew up the woman set me to do such work as I had strength for as needs was for there was no man dwelt anigh us and seldom did I ever see man or woman there and held no converse with any save as I shall tell thee presently though now and again a man or a woman passed by what they were I knew not nor their whence and whither but by seeing them I came to know that there were other folk in the world besides us two

 On a day of May tide I fared abroad with my goats and went far with them further from the house than I had been as yet

 Then I drove the goats out of their house and went my way towards the Dale of Lore and said to myself that the carline would teach me what further to do and I came there before the summer dark had quite prevailed and slept sweetly and softly amongst my goats after I had tethered them in the best of the pasture

 Then in a little while came those chiefs of ours and said that truce had been hanselled them for this time but on these terms that my lord and I and all those who had been in arms and whosoever would that feared the king s wrath should have leave to depart from his city so that they went and abode no nearer than fifty miles thereof till they should know his further pleasure

 Albeit that whosoever would go home peaceably might abide in the city still and need not fear the king s wrath if he stirred no further but that in any case the Sorceress should get her gone from those walls

 But now a long while years long we abode in that House of the Sorceress ere we durst seek further to the Well at the World s End

 Come said the Lady tarry not for I know that hunger hath hold of thee and look how low the sun is growing Then she caught him by the hand and fell to running with him to the edge of the stream where at the end of the further slope it ran wide and shallow before it entered into a deep pool overhung with boughs of alder and thorn

 He went further than he had looked for ere he found a prey to his mind and then he smote a roe with a shaft and slew her and broke up the carcase and dight it duly and so went his ways back

 Then he laughed and bethought him of Falcon his own steed and dived down under the water but as he came up laughing still and gasping he heard a noise of the clatter of horse hoofs as if some one were riding swiftly up the further side of the grassy table where it was stony as he had noted when they passed by

 But he said Well foster son for thou art pretty much that to me since the good town pleasureth thee little go we further afield

 But now lord Ralph I will tell thee one thing to wit that when I return hither after eight days wearing I shall be wending east as I said e en now and what will that mean save going somewhat nigher to the Wall of the World for my way lieth beyond the mountains that ye see from hence and beyond the mountains that lie the other side of those and I bid thee come with us and I will be thy warrant that so far thou shalt have no harm but when thou hast come so far and hast seen three very fair cities besides towns and castles and thorps and strange men and fair merchandize God forbid that thou shouldest wend further and so cast away thy young life for a gay coloured cloud

 Then another and an older man one that I remember a stout carle ere I left Swevenham said that this was not so but that the Tree was on the further side of the Wall of the World and that he who could lay his hand on the bole thereof was like enough to drink of the Well at the World s End

 But this word further would I say to thee that I have seen on thy neck also a pair of beads exceeding goodly

 Nay of thee also it will be looked for that thou shouldest do knightly service to the Port and even so Blaise means it to be therefore have I lied to him on thy behalf and bidden Clement also to lie which forsooth he may do better than I since he wotteth not wholly whither thou art minded and I have said thou wouldst go with Clement no further than Cheaping Knowe which lieth close to the further side of these mountains and will be back again in somewhat more than a half moon s wearing

 So Ralph went in company with some of the sergeants and others and looked at this and that about the town without hindrance save that the guard would not suffer them to pass further than the bailey of the Castle

 CHAPTER Ralph Hath Hope of Tidings Concerning the Well at the World s End Now he goes to Clement and tells him that he deems he has no need to abide their departure from Goldburg to say farewell and follow his quest further afield since it is clear that in Goldburg he should have no more tidings

 Clement spake to him and said This is the young knight who is minded to seek further east to wot if it be mere lies which he hath heard of the Well at the World s End

 Thus it goes As I left Utterbol a month ago I saw a damsel brought in captive there and she seemed to me so exceeding fair that I looked hard on her and asked one of the men at arms who is my friend concerning the market whereat she was cheapened and he told me that she had not been bought but taken out of the hands of the wild men from the further mountains

 The pavilion was hung with rich silken cloth and at the further end on a carpet of the hunting was an ivory chair whereon sat a man who was the only one sitting

 The day was clear as yesterday had been wherefore again Ralph saw the distant mountain top like a cloud and he gazed at it long till David said I see that thou art gazing hard at the mountains and perchance art longing to be beyond them were it but to see what like the land is on the further side

 Now further I would have thy leave to marshal thy maids about the seat where thou shouldest be and moreover there should be someone in thy seat even if I sat in it myself

 But whatever he hath a mind to let none hinder him but further him rather hearest thou take him with thee

 So rode Ralph till the sun was at point to rise and he was about the midst of one of those clearings or wood lawns on the further side whereof there was more thicket as he deemed then he had yet come to so he drew rein and looked about him for a minute

 They found it cleaving the pine wood which held on till the very bank of it and was thick again on the further side in a few yards space

 But at the further end whereas the wood closed in again was a little house builded of timber strong and goodly and thatched with wheat straw and beside it was a bubbling spring which ran in a brook athwart the said clearing over the house door was a carven rood and a bow and short spear were leaned against the wall of the porch

 Yet further I must needs tell thee that I know now that when I wept before thee it was partly in despite because I had found out in my heart though I bade it not tell me so much that I loved him but little

 So wore the days till Candlemass when the frost broke and the snows began to melt and the waters came down from the mountains so that the river rose over its banks and its waters covered the plain parts of the valley and those two could go dryshod but a little way out of their cavern no further than the green mound or toft which lay at the mouth thereof but the waters were thronged with fowl as mallard and teal and coots and of these they took what they would

 Thereafter they wandered about the woods with the wardens and the way leaders and the elder brought them to the ancient altar in the wood whereon the Sorceress had offered up the goat and the howe of the woman dight with the necklace of the Quest whom the Lady found dead in the snow and the place nigh the house where the Sorceress used to torment her thrall that was afterwards the Lady of Abundance yea and they went further afield till they came to the Vale of Lore and the Heath above it where they met the King s Son and the Lady

 On the morrow morn Ralph awoke and saw Ursula sleeping peacefully as he deemed and he looked about on the dreary desert and its dead men and saw no end to it though they lay on the top of one of those stony bents and he said softly to himself Will it end at all then Surely all this people of the days gone by were Seekers of the Well as we be and have they belike turned back from somewhere further on and might not escape the desert despite of all Shall we turn now shall we turn surely we might get into the kindly wood from here

 So came they to the brow and looked over it into a valley about which on all sides went the ridge save where it was broken down into a narrow pass on the further side so that the said valley was like to one of those theatres of the ancient Roman Folk whereof are some to be seen in certain lands

 Close to the water was a black rock as big as a man whereon was graven the sign of the way so they knew that there was no evil in the water wherefore they drank their fill and watered their horses abundantly and on the further bank was there abundance of good grass

 So when they had eaten they rested awhile but before they went further they despoiled them one after other and bathed in a pool of the river to wash the foul wilderness off them

 They would have taken leave of the Innocent Folk in the said vale but those others must needs go with them a little further and would not leave them till they were come to the jaws of the pass which led to the Rock of the Fighting Man

 Further than that indeed they would not or durst not go and those huge mountains they called the Wall of Strife even as they on the other side called them the Wall of the World

 But Ralph said As for that thou mayst go further than Swevenham and as far as Upmeads where there will be as many to love and cherish thee as at Swevenham

 Howsoever ye may be busied gainsay me not this and to morrow I shall further you on your way and give you a score of spears to follow thee to Goldburg

 Then as for Goldburg and Cheaping Knowe see ye to it yourselves but beyond Cheaping Knowe and the plain country thy name is known and the likeness of thee told in words and no man in those mountains shall hurt or hinder thee but all thou meetest shall aid and further thee

 Then said Ursula Lord of Utterbol this also thou mayst think on that it is no further from Utterbol to Upmeads than from Upmeads to Utterbol

 For all that is come and gone she is true and valiant and none may say that she is not fair and sweet enough for a better man than me and my great good luck it is that as I hope she looketh no further for a better

 Yea quoth the King and how far didst thou go beyond the mountains As far as Utterbol Said Ralph Yet further but not to Utterbol

 So he stayed his band and had Ursula into the rearward and bade all men look to their weapons and then they went forward heedfully and in good order and presently not only Ralph but all of them could see men standing in the jaws of the pass with the wood on either side of them and though at first they doubted if these were aught but mere strong thieves such as any wayfarers might come on they had gone but a little further when Michael knew them for the riders of Cheaping Knowe

 By sunset they were out of the wood and on the side of a rough fell so they went no further but lighted fires at the edge of the thicket and made merry round about them singing their songs concerning the deeds of their folk and jesting withal but not foully and they roasted venison of hart and hind at the fires and they had with them wine the more part whereof they had found in the slain King s carriages and they made great feast to the wayfarers and were exceeding fain of them after their fashion whereas if a man were their friend he could scarce be enough their friend and if he were their foe they could never be fierce enough with him

 But if thou deem at any time that matters go not so well with thee as thou wouldst then turn thine head to Upmeads and try it there and we shall further thee all we may

 Then Ralph turned to Ursula and raised her up and kissed her and they went down all of them from that place of death and ill hap and gat to horse on the other side of the stream and rode three miles further on by the glimmer of the moon and lay down to rest amongst the bushes of the waste with few words spoken between them

 So on a time a great company of them had ado with the Burgers somewhat recklessly and came to the worse wherefore some drew back into their fastness of the Scaur and the others still rode on and further west than their wont had been but warily when they had the Wood Perilous behind them for they had learned wisdom again

 Yea said the man belike ye shall find something less than peace betwixt here and Upmeads for rumour goes that there are alien riders come into the lands of Higham and for aught I know the said unpeace may spread further on

 There was much laughter and jeering at the Abbot s men amidst of the Dry Tree both of those who had ridden with Ralph and the new comers but they arrayed them to ride further in good order and presently were skirting the walls of Higham out of bow shot and making for the Down country by the clear of the moon

 Said Clement Yea fair lord and timely ye come both thou and thy company and now that I have my speech again which joy hath taken away from me at the first I shall tell thee this that if ye go further than the good town ye shall be met and fought withal by men who are over many and over fierce for us

 Then spake Ralph Where are my father and my mother and shall I go after them at once without resting through the dark night and all Said Clement and therewith his face brightened Nay thou needest go no further to look for them than the House of Black Canons within our walls there are they dwelling in all honour and dignity these two days past

 And yet further he wondered how it was that Ursula unholpen by the talisman should have done so much to bring him to the Well yea and how she was the first to see it while he slept

 But Ralph s brother Hugh had gotten him a horse and had fallen into the company of the Champions saying that he deemed they would go further forth than a sort of sheep tending churls and the runaways of Upmeads

 But even as they came within bowshot a great flight of arrows came from the further side of the water and the banner of the Fruitful Tree came forth from the bridge end with Nicholas and his tried men at arms behind it and then indeed great and grim was the murder and the proud men of the Burg grovelled on the ground and prayed for mercy till neither the Champions nor the men of Nicholas could smite helpless men any longer

 The author too keenly feels that he has no further claims than these and he therefore most diffidently asks for his work the indulgence of his readers

 Along the outer edge of this carrier the dunes cast up by the sea were prevented by the close tangle of thickets from drifting further inward and thus formed a breastwork which time and art were to strengthen

 The parallel need be pursued no further

 Advancing still further in his experiments upon human credulity he announced his approaching marriage with the Virgin Mary bade all his disciples to the wedding and exhibited himself before an immense crowd in company with an image of his holy bride

 Her subjects already half maddened by religious persecution were exasperated still further by the pecuniary burthens which she imposed upon them to supply the King s exigencies and she unhesitatingly confronted their frenzy in the hope of winning a smile from him

 His numbers were still further swollen by large bands of peasantry both men and women maddened by their recent injuries and thirsting for vengeance

 The edict further provided against all misprision of heresy by making those who failed to betray the suspected liable to the same punishment as if suspected or convicted themselves we forbid said the decree all persons to lodge entertain furnish with food fire or clothing or otherwise to favor any one holden or notoriously suspected of being a heretic 

 Further the prince shall appoint no foreigners to office in Brabant

 It was hinted that the young lady did not fancy the Prince but as it was not known that a word had ever been exchanged between them as the Prince in appearance and reputation was one of the most brilliant cavaliers of the age and as the approval of the bride was not usually a matter of primary consequence in such marriages of state the mystery seemed to require a further solution

 Further than this William who at that day was an easy indifferent Catholic averse to papal persecutions but almost equally averse to long puritanical prayers and faces taking far more pleasure in worldly matters than in ecclesiastical controversies was not disposed to advance in this thorny path

 You wrote me said he that you had hopes that this matter of the Prince s marriage would go no further and seeing that you did not write oftener on the subject I thought certainly that it had been terminated

 It is almost puerile to look further or deeper when such a source of convulsion lies at the very outset of any investigation

 The Cardinal further stated to his Majesty that he had been informed by these same nobles that the Duke of Alva when a hostage for the treaty of Cateau Cambresis had negotiated an alliance between the crowns of France and Spain for the extirpation of heresy by the sword

 They had charged none however because from their past services and their fidelity to his Majesty they expected to be believed on their honor without further witnesses or evidence

 Upon Philip s eager solicitations for further disclosures Margaret accordingly informed her brother of additional facts communicated to her after oaths of secrecy had been exchanged by Titelmann and his colleague del Canto

 The inquisitors had further accused him of having stolen rings jewels plate linen beds tapestry and other furniture from the establishment all which property he had sent to Friesland and of having seized one hundred thousand florins in ready money which had belonged to the last abbe an act consequently of pure embezzlement

 The Duchess announced that she could do nothing in the matter of the request until further information but that meantime she had charged Titelmann to conduct himself in his office with discretion and modesty

 An agitated and inconclusive debate followed in which however it sufficiently appeared as the Duchess informed her brother that one of two things must be done without further delay

 In one of the informal meetings of councillors now held almost daily on the subject of the impending Request Aremberg Meghen and Berlaymont maintained that the door should be shut in the face of the petitioners without taking any further notice of the petition

 In the mean time they requested her Highness to order a general surcease of the inquisition and of all executions until the King s further pleasure was made known and until new ordinances made by his Majesty with advice and consent of the states general duly assembled should be established

 In this second paper the confederates rendered thanks for the prompt reply which the Duchess had given to their Request expressed regrets that she did not feel at liberty to suspend the inquisition and declared their confidence that she would at once give such orders to the inquisitors and magistrates that prosecutions for religious matters should cease until the King s further pleasure should be declared

 As a further distinction they shaved their beards close excepting the moustachios which were left long and pendent in the Turkish fashion that custom as it seemed being an additional characteristic of Mendicants

 The confederates discussed if an exchange of vociferations could be called discussion principally two points whether in case they obtained the original objects of their petition they should pause or move still further onward and whether they should insist upon receiving some pledge from the government that no vengeance should be taken upon them for their previous proceedings

 There was some further conversation without any result

 It was further intimated by these reckless gentlemen that if they should be driven by violence into measures of self protection they had already secured friends in a certain country

 The Duchess probably astonished at the frankness of this statement is said to have demanded further explanations

 Philip further implored the Pope not to be scandalized with regard to the proposed pardon as it would be by no means extended to offenders against religion

 She further implored her brother to come forth as soon as possibe to avenge the injuries inflicted upon the ancient church adding that if deprived of that consolation she should incontinently depart this life

 The deed was not his however and he hastened in order to obviate the necessity of further violence to prepare articles of agreement upon the basis of Margaret s concessions

 The Count in the rough way habitual with him gave the culprit a sound rebuke for his intermeddling and threatened in case the offence were repeated to have him instantly bound gagged and forwarded to Brussels for further punishment

 Margaret wrote however in the same vein concerning him to Hoogstmaten affirming that nothing could be further from her intention than to characterize the proceedings of her cousin the Prince of Orange as contrary to the service of his Majesty knowing as she did how constant had been his affection and how diligent his actions in the cause of God and the King

 Brederode was already gone to the north to busy himself with further enrolments

 He pointed out that the arrangement offered them was founded upon the September concessions that the right of worship was conceded that the foreign garrison was forbidden and that nothing further could be justly demanded or honorably admitted

 At the same time Eboli was further instructed to confer with the same personages as to the most efficient means for preventing the escape of Baron Montigny to keep a vigilant eye upon his movements and to give general directions to governors and to postmasters to intercept his flight should it be attempted

 The President however came to his rescue and announced it as his legal opinion that the Governor need concern himself no further on the subject and that the code of the Fleece offered no legal impediment to the process

 It is hardly worth while to look any further into proceedings which were initiated and brought to a conclusion in the manner already narrated

 The Admiral it was further charged had advised and consented to the fusion of the finance and privy councils with that of state a measure which was clearly treasonable

 The fiction of loyalty certainly never went further

 He further charged him with the duty of shriving the victims and preparing their souls for death

 It was at least due to his long services that they should be spared further suffering

 Instead of halting at Reyden he had made his stand at Jemmingen about four leagues distant from that place and a little further down the river

 The same fifteen hundred musketeers were now advanced further towards the camp

 The President knew full well that the point had been reached beyond which the force of tyranny could go no further

 The King s orders to Alva to further the plan The Duke s remonstrances Explosion of the plot Obstinacy of Philip Renewed complaints of Alva as to the imprudent service required of him Other attempts of Philip to murder Elizabeth Don John of Austria in the Levant Battle of Lepanto Slothfulness of Selim Appointment of Medina Celi Incessant wrangling in Brussels upon the tax Persevering efforts of Orange Contempt of Alva for the Prince Proposed sentence of ignominy against his name Sonoy s mission to Germany Remarkable papers issued by the Prince The harangue Intense hatred for Alva entertained by the highest as well as lower orders Visit of Francis de Alva to Brussels His unfavourable report to the King Querulous language of the Duke Deputation to Spain Universal revolt against the tax Ferocity of Alva Execution of eighteen tradesmen secretly ordered Interrupted by the capture of Brill Beggars of the sea The younger Wild Boar of Ardennes Reconciliation between the English government and that of Alva The Netherland privateersmen ordered out of English ports De la Marck s fleet before Brill The town summoned to surrender Commissioners sent out to the fleet Flight of the magistrates and townspeople Capture of the place Indignation of Alva Popular exultation in Brussels Puns and Caricatures Bossu ordered to recover the town of Brill His defeat His perfidious entrance into Rotterdam Massacre in that city Flushing revolutionized Unsuccessful attempt of Governor de Bourgogne to recal the citizens to their obedience Expedition under Treslong from Brill to assist the town of Flushing Murder of Paccheco by the Patriots Zeraerts appointed Governor of Walcheren by Orange

 Up the ladder with you Senor you have no further use for your sword

 He was attended by a small band of French infantry while at nearly the same time the garrison was further strengthened by the arrival of a large number of volunteers from England

 In the early part of the following month Louis was still further strengthened by the arrival of thirteen hundred foot and twelve hundred horsemen under command of Count Montgomery the celebrated officer whose spear at the tournament had proved fatal to Henry the Second

 The assembly begged him to lay before them if it were possible any schemes and means which he might have devised for further resistance to the Duke of Alva

 With the fall of that city the province would be cut in twain the rebellious forces utterly dissevered and all further resistance it was thought rendered impossible

 The messenger was hanged a cruel but practical answer which put an end to all further traitorous communications

 This despatch invited a surrender at discretion but contained the solemn assurance that no punishment should be inflicted except upon those who in the judgment of the citizens themselves had deserved it and promised ample forgiveness if the town should submit without further delay

 In the course of the forenoon however it became obvious to Bossu that further resistance was idle

 With his further career this history has no concern and it is not desirable to enlarge upon the personal biography of one whose name certainly never excites pleasing emotions

 On the whole however in the embarrassed condition of affairs and while waiting for further supplies the Commander was secretly disposed to try the effect of a pardon

 The Count had even received one hundred thousand livres in hand as an earnest of the favorable intentions of France and was now busily engaged at the instance of the Prince in levying an army in Germany for the relief of Leyden and the rest of Holland while William on his part was omitting nothing whether by representations to the estates or by secret foreign missions and correspondence to further the cause of the suffering country

 It was a city walled in by bayonets and still further isolated from the people around by the impassable moat of mutual hatred

 as far as Leyden but the Green way another long dyke three quarters of a mile farther inward now rose at least a foot above the water to oppose their further progress

 Without further impediment the armada proceeded to North Aa the enemy retreating from this position also and flying to Zoeterwoude a strongly fortified village but a mile and three quarters from the city walls

 He wrote to the Prince that if the spring tide now to be expected should not together with a strong and favorable wind come immediately to their relief it would be in pain to attempt anything further and that the expedition would of necessity be abandoned

 The Prince with advice of the estates had granted the city as a reward for its sufferings a ten days annual fair without tolls or taxes and as a further manifestation of the gratitude entertained by the people of Holland and Zealand for the heroism of the citizens it was resolved that an academy or university should be forthwith established within their walls

 The estates disturbed by his vehemence and struck with its justice instantly and without further deliberation consented to his demand

 With his impoverished exchequer and ruin threatening his whole empire if this mortal combat should be continued many years longer he could have no motive for further bloodshed provided all heretics should consent to abandon the country

 The French government made use of the circumstance to justify itself in a still further alienation from the cause of the Prince than it had hitherto manifested but this was rather pretence than reality

 The Queen declared herself indisposed to go further at least before consulting parliament

 The obedient provinces had been purged of Protestants while crippled too by confiscation they offered no field for further extortion

 On the th of March letters were written by his Majesty to the states general to the provincial estates and to the courts of justice instructing them that until further orders they were all to obey the Council of State

 Moreover Councillor Hopper on further thoughts was not despatched at all to the Netherlands

 Without further ceremony the soldiers produced iron bars brought with them for the purpose forced all the gates from the hinges entered the hall of session and at a word from their commander laid hands upon the councillors and made every one prisoner

 Disrespect and rudeness could be pushed no further than it had already gone while the Prince of Orange the actual governor of the country considered his own preservation dependent upon maintaining things as they then were

 Don John further informed the King upon the envoy s authority that Elizabeth had refused assistance to the estates saying if she stirred it would be to render aid to Philip especially if France should meddle in the matter

 He further recommended that the Spanish troops thus forced to leave the Netherlands by land should be employed against the heretics in France

 The document further complained that the adherents of the Reformed religion were not allowed to frequent the different provinces in freedom according to the stipulations of Ghent that Don John notwithstanding all these short comings had been acknowledged as Governor General without the consent of the Prince that he was surrounded with a train of Spaniards Italians and other foreigners Gonzaga Escovedo and the like as well as by renegade Netherlanders like Tassis by whom he was unduly influenced against the country and the people and by whom a back door was held constantly open to the admission of evils innumerable

 We are further informed that she was a Minerva for eloquence that she composed matchless poems which she sang most exquisitely to the sound of her lute and that her familiar letters were so full of genius that poor Cicero was but a fool to her in the same branch of composition

 He further required that if the Prince of Orange did not instantly fulfil the treaty of Ghent the states should cease to hold any communication with him

 He bitterly asked what further concessions were required

 They begged further that ho would promise by a new and authentic act that the provinces of Holland and Zealand would not suffer the said exercise to be impugned or any new worship to be introduced in the other provinces of the Netherlands

 They had travelled further on the reforming path than many had done in that day and might even be called democratic in their notions

 As the skirmishing grew hotter however Goazaga observed that a spirited cavalry officer named Perotti had already advanced with a handful of men much further within the reach of the hostile forces than was deemed expedient

 A further proposition on their part for an Interim upon the plan attempted by Charles the Fifth in Germany previously to the Peace of Passau met with no more favor than it merited for certainly that name which became so odious in Germany that cats and dogs were called Interim by the common people in derision was hardly a potent word to conjure with at that moment in the Netherlands

 He observed further that in the opinion of her Majesty it was still possible to maintain peace by conforming to the counsels of the Prince of Orange and of the states general

 Should they interpose the least delay he would set upon them without further preface and he gave them notice with the arrogance becoming a Spanish general that the courier was already waiting to report to Spain the number of them left alive after the encounter

 The unlucky Prior of Renty whose disclosures to La Motte concerning the Spanish sarcasms upon his venality had so nearly caused the preliminary negotiation with that seignior to fail was the cause of still further mischief through the interception of Alonzo Curiel s private letters

 The deputies of the Union came thither he said as advocates of their provinces or their cities not as councillors of a commonwealth and sought to further those narrow interests even at the risk of destruction to their sister states

 In November he entered into a formal treaty with Terranova by which he was to receive as the price of the virtuous resolution which he contemplated the sum of ten thousand crowns in hand a further sum of ten thousand crowns within three months and a yearly pension of ten thousand florins

 Policy of electing Anjou as sovereign Commode et incommode Views of Orange Opinions at the French Court Anjou relieves Cambray Parma besieges Tourney Brave defence by the Princess of Espinoy Honorable capitulation Anjou s courtship in England The Duke s arrival in the Netherlands Portrait of Anjou Festivities in Flushing Inauguration at Antwerp The conditions or articles subscribed to by the Duke Attempt upon the life of Orange The assassin s papers Confession of Venero Gaspar Anastro His escape Execution of Venero and Zimmermann Precarious condition of the Prince His recovery Death of the Princess Premature letters of Parma Further negotiations with Orange as to the sovereignty of Holland and Zealand Character of the revised Constitution Comparison of the positions of the Prince before and after his acceptance of the countship

 This offer and acceptance however constituted but the preliminaries for it was further necessary that the letters of Renversal should be drawn up that they should be formally delivered and that a new constitution should be laid down and confirmed by mutual oaths

 The other gentlemen could of course do no less than imitate the impassibility of their chief and the repast was accordingly concluded without further interruption

 It was agreed to liberate the prisoners to restore the furniture and to send a special deputation for the purpose of making further arrangements with the Duke by word of mouth and for this deputation his Highness was requested to furnish a safe conduct

 Accordingly firmly refusing to heed the overtures of the United States and of Holland in particular he continued to further the re establishment of Anjou a measure in which as he deliberately believed lay the only chance of union and in dependence

 He succeeded in getting himself elected chief senator in Ghent and forthwith began to use all his influence to further the secret plot

 I have further enjoyed an inestimable advantage in the perusal of the whole correspondence between Philip II

 The timidity and procrastination of the court could be overcome no further

 To further this end many leading personages in France avowed to the envoys their determination to venture their lives and their fortunes and to use all the influence which they possessed at court

 For my part said he I would be glad in any thing to further them rather than to hinder them though they do not deserve it yet for the good the helping them at this time may bring ourselves

 While procuring this assistance in English troops he had been very urgent with the Queen to further the negotiations between the States and France and Paul Buys was offended with him as a mischief maker and an intriguer

 I dare be bound said he if you join with Treslong the States Admiral and send off both three score sail into his Indies we will force him to retire from conquering further and to be contented to let other princes live as well as he

 And further the wise person being pressed to answer might by conference of speeches and persuasions provoke them to offer to the Queen the ports of Flushing and Middelburg and the Brill wherein she meant not to claim any property but to hold them as gages for her expenses and for performances of their covenants

 They agreed further that all heretics should be exterminated without distinction throughout France and the Netherlands

 And now in accordance with this program Philip proceeded stealthily and industriously to further the schemes of Mucio to the exclusion of more urgent business

 His mother having since the death of Anjou no further interest in affecting to favour the Huguenots had arranged the basis of this treaty with the Spanish party

 Alexander Farnese he assured them had taken the firm determination to possess himself of that place without further delay

 Provided they would renounce the great object of the contest he seemed really desirous that they should escape further chastisement but to admit the worship of God according to the reformed creed was with him an inconceivable idea

 He asserted that the instigators of the rebellion were not seeking to further the common weal but their own private ends

 Tell them further that the siege will never be abandoned and that this bridge will be my sepulcher or my pathway into Antwerp

 Another young officer of Parma s body guard Francois de Liege by name standing on the Kalloo end of the bridge rose like a feather into the clouds and flying quite across the river alighted on the opposite bank with no further harm than a contused shoulder

 Without further loss of time he employed his men to collect the drifting boats timber and spar work and to make a hasty and temporary restoration in semblance at least of the ruined portion of his bridge

 So gay and gallant was the victor that he announced another banquet on the following day still further to celebrate the happy release of Antwerp and invited the fair ladies around him again to grace the board

 Sainte Aldegonde was now occupied in bringing about the capitulation of Antwerp without any provision for religious liberty a concession which Parma had most distinctly refused and it was not probable that Holland and Zeeland after twenty years of hard fighting and with an immediate prospect of assistance from England could now be induced to resign the great object of the contest without further struggle

 Furious cries for bread were uttered and some meagre looking individuals were thrust forward to indicate the famine which was prevailing and the necessity of concluding the treaty without further delay

 The same morning the council of Zeeland taking knowledge of his arrival sent unto him the pensioner of Middelburgh and this town to sound the causes of his coming and to will him in their behalf to keep his house and to forbear all meddling by word or writing with any whatsoever till they should further advise and determine in his cause

 For my own part I acknowledge that indeed I thought some further advice would either alter or at least detract from the accomplishment of her determination

 The ambassadors say further that they have had an interview with your deputies who are excessively provoked at this most unexpected answer from the King and are making loud complaints being all determined to take themselves off as fast as possible

 The Queen to his knowledge he said was quite ready to assume the protectorate but it was necessary that it should be formally offered with the necessary guarantees and that without further loss of time

 Sir Francis assured the envoy that he would use every effort by letter to her Majesty and by verbal instructions to his son in law Sir Philip Sidney to further the success of the negotiation and that he deeply regretted his enforced absence from the court on so important an occasion

 At the further end of these is a bowl

 Some of them meant for the service of God and the advantage of the King of Spain to further the delivery of some notable towns in Holland and Zeeland to the said King and his ministers and we are like to hear of these individuals again

 In my opinion he can neither love Queen nor country that would not wish and further it should be so

 There is but a small number of the first bands left said Sir John Conway and those so pitiful and unable ever to serve again as I leave to speak further of theirs to avoid grief to your heart

 The committee was further authorised to arrange the commission for the governor in accordance with these points and to draw up a set of instructions for

 The committee was also empowered to conclude the matter at once without further reference to the States

 Therefore there might be some suspicion conceived that by offering on their part and refusal on hers some further mischief might be secretly hidden by some odd person s device to the hurt of the cause

 Under one pretext or another continued the envoy my Lord of Leicester had long delayed to satisfy them and in so stating he went somewhat further in defence of his absent friend than the facts would warrant for he neither flatly refused it nor was willing to accept until your Majesty s pleasure should be known

 Nevertheless these rumours to the discredit of her good faith were doing infinite harm while the Earl although keeping his eyes and ears wide open was anxious not to compromise himself any further with his sovereign by appearing himself to suspect her of duplicity

 It was then agreed that Leicester should be continued in the government which he had accepted until the matter should be further considered and letters to that effect were at once written

 We find that Sir Thomas Heneage said she to Leicester hath gone further in assuring the States that we would make no peace without their privity and assent than he had commission for that our direction was if our meaning had been well set down and not mistaken by our Secretary that they should have been only let understand that in any treaty that might pass between us and Spain they might be well assured we would have no less care of their safety than of our own

 The secretary therefore stated the royal wish at present to be that the renunciation of the title should be delayed till Heneage could visit England and subsequently return to Holland with her Majesty s further directions

 Yet I will not only acknowledge with all humbleness and dutiful thanks the exceeding joy these last blessed lines brought to my long wearied heart but will with all true loyal affection attend that further joy from your sweet self which may utterly extinguish all consuming fear away

 He had recently however as we have seen received some comfort and he was still further encouraged upon the eve of Heneage s departure by receiving another affectionate epistle from the Queen

 It was however stipulated that the nonconformists of Holland and Zeeland who should be forced into exile were to have their property administered by papist trustees and further that the Spanish inquisition was not to be established in the Netherlands

 The Queen was further represented as taking great pains to excuse both the expedition of Sir Francis Drake to the Indies and the mission of Leicester to the Provinces

 For this reason he informed the King that it would be advisable to drop all further negotiation with England for the time as it was hardly probable that with such advantages gained by the Queen she would be inclined to proceed in the path which had been just secretly opened

 Nevertheless if you have authority to enter upon and to conclude this negotiation you will find my ears open to hear your propositions and I tell you further if a peace is to be made that I wish you to be the mediator thereof

 We beg you therefore to communicate without further preface that which you have been charged to say

 After the lapse of several days the servant returned to make further enquiries

 It would be further desirable that Alexander should take most of the personages of quality and sufficiency in the Provinces over with him to England in order that they should not make mischief in his absence

 He further advised that old Peter Ernest Mansfeld should be left commander in chief of the forces in the Netherlands during his own absence in England

 Martin shut himself up in the castle and having recently committed a rather discreditable homicide which still further increased his unpopularity with the patriots he made overtures to Parma

 Afterwards he meant to possess himself of the Rhine flowing in a parallel course about twenty five miles further to the east

 The famous Babington conspiracy discovered by Walsingham s travail and cost had come to convince the Queen and her counsellors if further proof were not superfluous that her throne and life were both incompatible with Philip s deep designs and that to keep that monarch out of the Netherlands was as vital to her as to keep him out of England

 I know further that your commission carreeth no authority to warrant you to intermeddle any further than with the government of the soldiers and guard of the town

 Well you may in your own conceipt confer some words to authorize you in some larger sort but believe me Sir they will not warrant you sufficiently to deal any further than I have said for I have perused a copy of your commission for that purpose

 Wherefore I do eftsoons intreat and require you to forbear to intermeddle any further

 He commenced by observing that the United Provinces still entertained the hope that her Majesty would conclude upon further thoughts to accept the sovereignty over them with reasonable conditions but the most important passages of his address were those relating to the cost of the war

 And so I will leave you to day without troubling you further

 And precisely upon the distrust thus created as a foundation they raised a back stairs council by means of which they were able to further their ambitious avaricious and seditious practices notwithstanding the good advice and remonstrances of the council of state and the States General and Provincial

 Her Majesty doth wholly lend herself to devise some further means to disgrace her poor council in respect whereof she neglecteth all other causes 

 Wilkes had heard some rumours of intrigues between Parma s agents at Deventer and Hohenlo and had confided them to Walsingham hoping that the Secretary would keep the matter in his own breast at least till further advice

 we find it strange that you should proceed further

 And although we had given you full and ample direction to proceed to a public dealing in that cause yet our own discretion seeing the difficulties and dangers that you yourself saw in the propounding of the matter ought to have led you to delay till further command from us

 Her Majesty then instructed her envoy in case he had not yet propounded the matter in the state house to the general assembly to pause entirely until he heard her further pleasure

 If you did know how infinitely her Majesty did at my departure and before for in this matter of peace she hath specially used me this good while command me pray me and persuade me to further and hasten the same with all the speed possible that might be and how on the other side I have continually been the man and the mean that have most plainly dehorted her from such post haste and that she should never make good peace without a puissant army in the field you would then say that I had now cause to fear her displeasure for being too slow and not too forward

 He was to make the same representations to the States and he was further most explicitly to inform all concerned that in case they were unmoved by these suggestions her Majesty had quite made up her mind to accept the handsome offers of peace held out by the King of Spain and to leave them to their fate

 He had pointed out the errors of the Earl s administration he had fearlessly earnestly but respectfully deplored the misplaced parsimony of the Queen he had warned her against the delusions which had taken possession of her keen intellect he had done his best to place the governor general upon good terms with the States and with his sovereign but it had been impossible for him to further his schemes for the acquisition of a virtual sovereignty over the Netherlands or to extinguish the suspicions of the States that the Queen was secretly negotiating with the Spaniard when he knew those suspicions to be just

 This little beginning on the coast of Spain might not seem to his Catholic Majesty a matter to be thankful for nor be likely to further a pacification and so Elizabeth hastened to disavow her Plymouth captain

 His Holiness proposed to Philip the invasion of England and offered a million to further the plan

 He simply and diplomatically answered however that he could not but concur with the Secretary in lamenting the misery of the Provinces and people so utterly despoiled and ruined but as it might be matter of dispute from what head this fountain of calamity was both fed and derived he would not enter further therein it being a matter much too high for his capacity

 Although said he the Queen might justly require that the cessation should be general for all the King s dominion yet in order not to stand on precise points she is content that it should extend no further than to the towns of Flushing Brief Ostend and Bergen op Zoom

 To this he said nothing wrote the envoy and so I went no further

 But Champagny here interrupted protested that the president was going too far and begged him to show the commission without further argument

 Sharp words but not sharp enough to prevent a further delay of a month for it was not till the th June that the commissioners at last came together at Bourbourg that miserable little hole on the coast between Ostend and Newport against which Gamier had warned them

 Yea God forbid else replied Alexander and further I know nothing of any bull of the Pope nor do I care for any nor do I undertake anything for him

 Oh illustrious Queen he began the churches of the United Netherlands He had got no further when the Queen interrupting exclaimed Oh I beg you at another time I cannot now listen to a speech

 He gave orders as well as might be that every ship after the danger should be passed was to return to its post and await his further orders

 But Howard decided to wrestle no further pull

 Nassau represented the Duke of Parma as evidently discouraged as having already disembarked his troops and as very little disposed to hazard any further enterprise against England

 But after the scenes on which the last full moon had looked down in those waters there could be no further pretence on the part of Farnese to issue from Sluys and Dunkerk and England and Holland were thenceforth saved from all naval enterprises on the part of Spain

 But insuperable obstacles presented themselves nor was Alexander desirous of affording still further pretexts for his slanderers

 Nevertheless it would perhaps have proved an easier task than it appeared for so great was the panic within the place that a large number of the inhabitants had fled the Cardinal Viceroy Archduke Albert had but a very insufficient guard and there were many gentlemen of high station who were anxious to further the entrance of the English and who were afterwards hanged or garotted for their hostile sentiments to the Spanish government

 At last when the case seemed almost desperate he loudly declared that sufficient had been unladen for that evening and that it was too dark and he too tired for further work

 he was now fully bent upon making his own without further loss of time

 But Gaetano although he could wring but fifty thousand crowns from his Holiness after the fatal fight of Ivry to further the good cause was lavish in expenditures from his own purse and from other sources and this too at a time when thirty three per cent

 Whereupon the suitor opened all his batteries without further delay and the spinster gave a fresh example of the inevitable fate of talking castles and listening ladies

 at the feet of the King of Spain hoping by still further drafts on his exchequer and his credulity to prolong indefinitely their own ignoble reign

 Buzanval further reminded the States that Henry had received the most encouraging promises from the protestant princes of Germany and that so great a personage as the Viscount Turenne who had now gone thither to reap the fruit of those promises would not have been sent on such a mission except that its result was certain

 He discoursed at large of his miserable estate of the factions of his servants and of their ill dispositions and then required my opinion touching his course for Brittan as also what further aid he might expect from her Majesty alleging that unless he were presently strengthened by England it was impossible for him longer to resist the greatness of the King of Spain who assailed his country by Brittany Languedoc the Low Countries by the Duke of Saxony and the Duke of Lorraine and so ended his speech passionately

 He concluded by urging him to advance into that country in person but did not pledge himself on behalf of her Majesty to any further assistance

 He had seen enough of the young prince s tactics and had no further wish to break his teeth against those scientific entrenchments

 Meantime Prince Maurice the season being so far advanced gave the world no further practical lessons in the engineering science and sent his troops into winter quarters

 Moreo had further been endeavouring to prejudice the Duke of Mayenne against the King of Spain and himself saying that he Farnese had been commissioned to take Mayenne into custody with plenty of similar lies

 He was further directed to leave Count Mansfeld at the head of affairs during this temporary absence as had been the case so often before instructing him to make use of the Marquis of Cerralbo who was already there to lighten labours that might prove too much for a man of Mansfeld s advanced age

 Those who best understand the fit remedy for this unfortunate kingdom and know the tastes and temper of the nation said he doubt giving these vast presents and rewards in order that the nobles of France may affect your cause and further your schemes

 But the Leaguers archbishop said that he could make no further advances

 What help said they can the League expect from the old and broken Philip from a king who in thirty years has not been able with all the resources of his kingdoms to subdue the revolted provinces of the Netherlands How can he hope to conquer France Pay no further heed to the legate they said who is laughing in his sleeve at the miseries and distractions of our country

 When his famous Armada had been shattered and sunk have we not seen him peevishly requiring Alexander Farnese to construct a new one immediately and to proceed therewith to conquer England out of hand Was it to be expected that he would renounce his conquest of France although the legitimate king had entered his capital had reconciled himself to the Church and was on the point of obtaining forgiveness of the pope If the Prince of Bearne had already destroyed the Holy League why should not the Duke of Mayenne and Archduke Ernest make another for him and so conquer France without further delay But although it was still possible to deceive the king who in the universality of his deceptive powers was so prone to delude himself it was difficult even for so accomplished an intriguer as Mayenne to hoodwink much longer the shrewd Spaniards who were playing so losing a game against him

 Prince Maurice lays siege to Gertruydenberg Advantages of the new system of warfare Progress of the besieging operations Superiority of Maurice s manoeuvres Adventure of Count Philip of Nassau Capitulation of Gertruydenberg Mutiny among the Spanish troops Attempt of Verdugo to retake Coeworden Suspicions of treason in the English garrison at Ostend Letter of Queen Elizabeth to Sir Edward Norris on the subject Second attempt on Coeworden Assault on Groningen by Maurice Second adventure of Philip of Nassau Narrow escape of Prince Maurice Surrender of Groningen Particulars of the siege Question of religious toleration Progress of the United Netherlands Condition of the obedient Netherlands Incompetency of Peter Mansfeld as Governor Archduke Ernest the successor of Farnese Difficulties of his position His unpopularity Great achievements of the republicans Triumphal entry of Ernest into Brussels and Antwerp Magnificence of the spectacle Disaffection of the Spanish troops Great military rebellion Philip s proposal to destroy the English fleet His assassination plans Plot to poison Queen Elizabeth Conspiracies against Prince Maurice Futile attempts at negotiation Proposal of a marriage between Henry and the Infanta Secret mission from Henry to the King of Spain Special dispatch to England and the Staten Henry obtains further aid from Queen Elizabeth and the States Council Anxiety of the Protestant countries to bring about a war with Spain Aspect of affairs at the close of the year 

 The army had been further weakened by sickness and numerous desertions

 Should Philip not appropriate the throne without further scruple in person it was on the whole decided that his favorite nephew should be the satrap of that outlying district of the Spanish empire

 The spirit further informed the poet that the forests of the Low Countries so long infested by brigands wood beggars and malefactors of all kinds would thenceforth swarm with nymphs rabbits hares and animals of that nature

 Lopez to poison Queen Elizabeth at the instigation of Count Fuentes for fifty thousand crowns to be paid by the King of Spain they charged upon the same Fuentes and upon Ybarra that they had employed the same Andrada to murder the King of France with a nosegay of roses and they alluded further to the revelations of Michael Renichon who was to murder Maurice of Nassau and kidnap Frederic William even as their father and brother had been already murdered and kidnapped

 Further achievements on the part of Maurice after the fall of Groningen were therefore renounced for that year and his troops went into garrison and winter quarters

 The king further stigmatized in energetic language the long succession of intrigues by which the monarch of Spain as chief of the Holy League had been making war upon him by means of his own subjects for the last half dozcn years

 The dying Ernest consented and upon his death Fuentes was declared governor general until the king s further pleasure should be known

 Count Charles Mansfeld tired of governing his decrepit parent Peter Ernest who since the appointment of Fuentes had lost all further chance of governing the Netherlands had now left Philip s service and gone to the Turkish wars

 But before narrating the further movements of the vigorous new governor general it is necessary to glance at the military operations in the eastern part of the Netherlands and upon the Rhine

 The two armies lay over against each other with the river between them for some days longer but it was obvious that nothing further would be attempted on either side

 But he had been always a prisoner and his soul a hopeless captive could no longer be liberated now that the tyrant in order to further his own secret purposes had at last released his body from gaol

 The English ministers having answered that this was all the queen could do the duke and Saucy rose in much excitement saying that they had then no further business than to ask for an audience of leave and to return to France as fast as possible

 The king further bound himself to carry on a sharp offensive war in Artois and Hainault

 There were strong professions of a desire on the part of the king for a peace but it was for a general peace nothing further

 The king further suggested that the enemy encouraged by his success at Cadiz the previous summer might be preparing a fresh expedition against Spain in which case the invasion of England would be easier to accomplish

 They had formerly professed the Protestant religion and had been thrown into prison for that crime but the fear of further persecution human weakness or perhaps sincere conviction had caused them to renounce the error of their ways and they now went to mass

 But the king s reply to Calvaert when after the interview with Villeroy that envoy was admitted to the royal dressing room for private conversation and took the occasion to remonstrate with his Majesty on these intrigues with the Spanish agent was that he should send off Balvena in such fashion that it would take from the cardinal archduke all hope of troubling him with any further propositions

 Buzanval the regular French envoy at the Hague even while amazing the States by rebukes for their short comings in the field and by demands for immediate co operation in the king s campaign when the king was doing nothing but besiege Amiens astonished the republican statesmen still further by telling them that his master was listening seriously to the pope s secret offers

 It was to be considered however so Henry s envoy intimated both at Greenwich and the Hague that if the king should accept the pope s intervention he would be obliged to exclude from a share in it the queen and all others not of the Catholic religion and it was feared that the same necessity which had compelled him to listen to these overtures would force him still further in the same path

 She further informed the republican envoy that the king had recently been taking the ground in these dealings with the common enemy that the two kingdoms of France and England must first be provided for that when the basis between these powers and Spain had been arranged it would be time to make arrangements for the States and that it would probably be found advisable to obtain a truce of three or four years between them and Spain in which interval the government of the provinces might remain on its actual footing

 Elizabeth further reproachfully observed that although the king talked about continuing the war he seemed really tired of that dangerous pursuit in which he had exercised himself so many long years and that he was probably beginning to find a quiet and agreeable life more to his taste

 The queen here broke forth into mighty oaths interrupting the envoy s discourse protesting over and over again by the living God that she would not and could not give the States any further assistance that she would leave them to their fate that her aid rendered in their war had lasted much longer than the siege of Troy did and swearing that she had been a fool to help them and the king of France as she had done for it was nothing but evil passions that kept the States so obstinate

 It was further agreed by the treaty which was definitely signed on the th August that in case England were invaded by the common enemy the States should send to the queen s assistance at least thirty ships of war besides five thousand infantry and five squadrons of horse

 Philip further provided that thirty thousand masses should be said for his soul five hundred slaves liberated from the galleys and five hundred maidens provided with marriage portions

 It would only be necessary to fit out another expedition on a larger scale the next year provide it with a cargo of merchandize suitable for the China market and initiate the direct polar oriental trade without further delay

 She further observed that as the agents of the Spanish Government had been perpetually sending to her she had been inclined once for all to learn what they had to say

 The next day brought them three leagues further to a place called Eckerloo

 Retreat if retreat were desired was already impossible and as to surprising the garrison of Nieuport and so obtaining that stronghold as a basis for further aggressive operations it is very certain that if any man in Flanders was more surprised than another at that moment it was Prince Maurice himself

 Vere advised that the whole army should at once be concentrated and led without delay against the archduke before he should make further progress

 The States of their own authority had endeavoured to send out those riders towards the scene of action but it was with great difficulty that they could be got into the saddle at all and they positively refused to go further than St

 They were instantly sent to the rear without being allowed to speak further in order that they might deliver their message in private to the commander in chief

 The prisoner was at once gagged that he might spread his disheartening news no further but as he persisted by signs and gestures in attempting to convey the information which he had evidently been sent forward to impart he was shot by command of the stadholder and so told no further tales

 The victor had saved the republic from impending annihilation but was incapable of further efforts during the summer

 Towards the latter part of the century however the poor little open village had been fortified to such purpose as to enable it to beat off the great Alexander Farnese when he had made an impromptu effort to seize it in the year after his successful enterprise against Dunkirk and Nieuport and subsequent preparation had fortunately been made against any further attempt

 Nothing further was accomplished by Maurice that year but meantime something had been doing within and around Ostend

 The prince manifested at first some unwillingness to forego the glory of the attack from which he confidently expected a crowning victory but yielding to the representations of his chief generals that it was better to have his town without further bloodshed he consented to treat

 There was no further object in continuing the comedy of negotiation for the ships now arriving seemed crowded with troops

 A magnificent booty was equitably divided among the captors the vanquished crew were set safely on shore and the Hollanders then pursued their home voyage without further adventures

 There were no further military operations of moment during the rest of the year

 Highly applauding the sentiments expressed and desiring to excite still further the resentment of James against Spain he painted a vivid picture of the progress of that aggressive power in the past century

 It was further provided with anchors which were to be tossed over the parapet of the doomed redoubt while the assailants thus grappled to the enemy s work were to dash over the bridge after having silenced the opposing fire by means of their own peripatetic battery

 Catharine rose frowning before him overshadowing his path and completely prohibiting all further progress

 Four or five miles further towards the west two nearly parallel streams both navigable called the Sweet and the Salt ran from Dam to Sluys

 He had got a better Ostend in Slays and he saw no motive for spending money and blood in any further attempt to gain possession of a ruin which even if conquered could only with extreme difficulty be held

 The roads and fields were fast becoming impassable sloughs and no further large operations could be expected in this campaign

 Du Terrail made no further attempts that summer although the list of his surprises was not yet full

 As there seemed no further danger to be apprehended from the broken mutinous and dispersed forces of the enemy the siege operations were conducted in a leisurely manner

 There were no further exploits on land or sea that year

 The republic would acquire in reality the grandeur which with Spain was but an empty boast would have the glory of transferring the great war beyond the limits of home into those far distant possessions where the enemy deemed himself most secure and would teach the true religion to savages sunk in their own superstitions and still further depraved by the imported idolatries of Rome

 A day of public fast humiliation thanksgiving and prayer was ordered throughout the republic for the th of May in order to propitiate the favour of Heaven on the great work to be undertaken and as a further precaution Prince Maurice ordered all garrisons in the strong places to be doubled lest the slippery enemy should take advantage of too much confidence reposed in his good faith

 What need to dilate further upon such a minister and upon such a system of government To bribe and to be bribed to maintain stipendiaries in every foreign Government to place the greatness of the empire upon the weakness distraction and misery of other nations to stimulate civil war revolts of nobles and citizens against authority separation of provinces religious discontents in every land of Christendom such were the simple rules ever faithfully enforced

 towards the republic State of France Further peace negotiations Desire of King James of England for the restoration of the States to Spain Arrival of the French commissioners President Jeannin before the States General Dangers of a truce with Spain Dutch legation to England Arrival of Lewis Verreyken at the Hague with Philip s ratification Rejection of the Spanish treaty Withdrawal of the Dutch fleet from the Peninsula The peace project denounced by the party of Prince Maurice Opposition of Maurice to the plans of Barneveld Amended ratification presented to the States General Discussion of the conditions Determination to conclude a peace Indian trade Exploits of Admiral Matelieff in the Malay peninsula He lays siege to Malacca Victory over the Spanish fleet Endeavour to open a trade with China Return of Matelieff to Holland

 He had further intimated his opinion that instead of waiting for the king s consent it more comported with the king s dignity for the archdukes to enter into negotiations to make a preliminary and brief armistice with the enemy and then to solicit the royal approval of what had been done

 Otherwise number two was to be delivered and it contained a request to be relieved from all further employment in the king s service

 With this form it was added the king was to comply within six weeks if he desired to proceed further in negotiations with the States

 He did not forget that when the subject had been discussed by the favourers of the scheme in Barneveld s own house Barneveld himself had prophesied that one day or another the rights would burst out which his Excellency had to become prince of the provinces on strength of the signed and sealed documents addressed to the late Prince of Orange that he had further alluded to the efforts then on foot to make him Duke of Gelderland adding with a sneer that Zeeland was all agog on the subject while in that province there were individuals very desirous of becoming children of Zebedee

 It was further intimated however that the ratification was only received for reference to the estates of each of the provinces and it was promised that within six weeks the commissioners should be informed whether the provinces would consent or refuse to treat

 Before he could take a decision he had the satisfaction of seeing the enemy panic struck save him any further trouble

 Movements of the Emperor Rudolph Marquis Spinola s reception at the Hague Meeting of Spinola and Prince Maurice Treaty of the Republic with the French Government The Spanish commissioners before the States General Beginning of negotiations Stormy discussions Real object of Spain in the negotiations Question of the India trade Abandonment of the peace project Negotiations for a truce Prolongation of the armistice Further delays Treaty of the States with England Proposals of the Spanish ambassadors to Henry of France and to James of England Friar Neyen at the court of Spain Spanish procrastination Decision of Philip on the conditions of peace Further conference at the Hague Answer of the States General to the proposals of the Spanish Government General rupture

 It was further stipulated in the convention that the debt of the States to England then amounting to L sterling should be settled by annual payments of L to begin with the expected peace

 He was still further appalled at last by discovering that the delay was absolutely for the delay s sake

 New marriage project between France and Spain Formal proposition of negotiating for a truce between the States and Spain Exertions of Prince Maurice to counteract the designs of Barneveld Strife between the two parties in the republic Animosity of the people against Barneveld Return of the Spanish commissioners Further trifling Dismissal of the commissioners Close of the negotiations Accidental discovery of the secret instructions of the archdukes to the commissioners Opposing factions in the republic Oration of President Jeannin before the States General Comparison between the Dutch and Swiss republics Calumnies against the Advocate Ambassador Lambert in France Henry s letter to Prince Maurice Reconciliation of Maurice and Barneveld Agreement of the States to accept a truce

 It was further decided on the th September to wait until the end of the month for the answer from Spain

 To express a hope that the king might perhaps give his future approval to a proceeding for which his signed and sealed consent had been exacted as an indispensable preliminary was carrying effrontery further than had yet been attempted in these amazing negotiations

 To this end they had sincerely and faithfully dealt with the gentlemen deputed for that purpose by their High Mightinesses the States doing everything they could think of to further the cause of peace

 On the other hand what good could it do to the cause of peace that these wonderful instructions should be published throughout the republic They might almost seem a fiction invented by the war party to inspire a general disgust for any further negotiation

 He intimated to the king and his ministers that Jeannin and his colleagues were pushing the truce at the Hague much further and faster than his Majesty could possibly approve and that they were obviously exceeding their instructions

 It was further debated as to the number of troops that it be advisable for the States to maintain during the truce and Barneveld expressed his decided opinion that thirty thousand men at least would be required

 In case anything to the contrary should be attempted by the king or the archdukes and the deliberations protracted in consequence more than eight days it was further decided by unanimous vote that the negotiations should at once be broken off and the war forthwith renewed with the help if possible of the kings princes and states friends of the good cause

 The other five provinces dared to make no further effort in that direction against the two controlling states of the republic

 Had not something been gained for the world when this language was held by a Catholic on the very spot where less than a half century before the whole population of the Netherlands men women and children had been condemned to death by a foreign tyrant for the simple reason that it was just legal and a Christian duty to punish the weak for refusing to follow the religion of the strong As for the perils which some affect to fear said Jeannin further if this liberty of worship is accorded experience teaches us every day that diversity of religion is not the cause of the ruin of states and that a government does not cease to be good nor its subjects to live in peace and friend ship with one another rendering due obedience to the laws and to their rulers as well as if they had all been of the same religion without having another thought save for the preservation of the dignity and grandeur of the state in which God had caused them to be born

 It was agreed that in case of his marriage he should receive a further yearly sum of florins and this addition was soon afterwards voted to him outright it being obvious that the prince would remain all his days a bachelor

 Need men look further than to this simple fact to learn why Spain was decaying while the republic was rising The ordinary budget of the United Provinces was about equal to that of England varying not much from four millions of florins or four hundred thousand pounds

 Believe and cause to be believed that the present condition of our affairs requires more aid in counsel and money than ever before and that nothing could be better bestowed than to further this end

 He professed an ardent attachment to her family a profound reverence for the virtues sacrifices and achievements of her lamented husband and a warm desire to do everything to further the interests of the son who had proved himself so worthy of his parentage

 He further expressed the conviction that Henry ought to have such authority over the Netherlands that they would embrace blindly whatever counsel he chose to give them even if they saw in it their inevitable ruin and this not so much from remembrance of assistance rendered by him but from the necessity in which they should always feel of depending totally upon him

 He further summoned all pretenders to the duchies to appear before him in person or by proxy to make good their claims

 The States General were further apprised by the King that his interests and theirs were so considerable in the matter that they would probably be obliged to go into a brisk and open war in order to prevent the Spaniard from establishing himself in the duchies

 He desired them further to send their forces at once to the frontier of Gelderland under Prince Maurice without committing any overt act of hostility but in order to show that both the King and the States were thoroughly in earnest

 It seemed he said as if the Archdukes thought they had no further need of them or as if a stamp of the foot could raise new armies out of the earth

 I shall give my nephew who loves the chase a thousand times better than he does ladies livres a year and I wish no other favour from her than her affection without making further pretensions

 Henry out of good nature or perhaps for less creditable reasons had come to the rescue of the accused princess and had caused the process to be stopped further enquiry to be quashed and the son to be recognized as legitimate Prince of Conde

 The Dowager had subsequently done her best to further the King s suit to her son s wife for which the Prince bitterly reproached her to her face heaping on her epithets which she well deserved

 If he should come to Breda or to any other place within the jurisdiction of the States they were requested to make sure of his person at once and not to permit him to retire until further instructions should be received from the King

 De Praslin captain of the body guards and lieutenant of Champagne it was further mentioned was to be sent immediately on secret mission concerning this affair to the States and to the Archdukes

 The great Spinola fell in love with her at once sent for the illustrious Rubens from Antwerp to paint her portrait and offered Mademoiselle de Chateau Vert crowns in gold if she would do her best to further his suit with her mistress

 After those commissioners had gone further hindrances had been found in the extraordinary tempests high floods rising of the waters both of the ocean and the rivers and the very disastrous inundations throughout nearly all the United Provinces with the immense and exorbitant damage thus inflicted both on the public and on many individuals in addition to all which were to be mentioned the troubles in the city of Utrecht

 Further assistance in men artillery and supplies were promised under certain contingencies and the plan of the campaign on the Meuse in conjunction with the King of France was duly mapped

 The commissioners were further to point out the various contraventions on the part of the Archdukes of the Treaty of Truce and were to give an exposition of the manner in which the States General had quelled the tumults at Utrecht and reasons why such a course had of necessity been adopted

 The Marquis de Coeuvres remained in disgrace after the failure of his mission Henry believing that like all the world he had fallen in love with the Princess and had only sought to recommend himself not to further the suit of his sovereign

 To further either of these expedients the Archduke would do his best

 Partly to give check in advance to the intrigues which would probably at a later date be made by Conde supported by the power of Spain to invalidate the legitimacy of the Dauphin but more especially perhaps to further and to conceal what the faithful Sully called the damnable artifices of the Queen s intimate councillors sinister designs too dark to be even whispered at that epoch and of which history during the lapse of more than two centuries and a half has scarcely dared to speak above its breath it was deemed all important that the coronation should take place

 Conde having no further reason to remain in exile received as a gift from the trembling Mary de Medici the magnificent Hotel Gondy where the Dutch ambassadors had so recently been lodged for which she paid crowns together with crowns to furnish it crowns to pay his debts more as yearly pension

 Aerssens worked assiduously two hours long on one occasion to effect a reconciliation between the two great Protestant chiefs but found Bouillon s demands so shameful and unreasonable that he felt obliged to renounce all further attempts

 He further declared in language not to be mistaken that the States would never abandon the princes and their cause

 The friends of the crown he said had no occasion to further it and it would be much better to listen to propositions for a treaty

 He desired further information from the commissioners especially in regard to those articles of their instructions which referred to a general rupture

 Thus having spoken with the air of a man who had left nothing further to be said on predestination or justification the King rose took off his hat and drank a bumper to the health of the States General and his Excellency Prince Maurice and success to the affair of Cleve

 It was further agreed that Leopold in requital of these services should receive the crown of Bohemia be elected King of the Romans and declared heir to the Emperor so far as Rudolph could make him his heir

 Spinola then took and garrisoned the city of Xanten but went no further

 Until further notice they decreed that no man should be required to believe more than had been laid down in the Five Points I

 They had given no further pledge than this to the Union

 The Envoy was likewise instructed to do his best to further the matrimonial alliance which had begun to be discussed between the Prince of Wales and the second daughter of France

 You will do your best to further this great end

 A despatch came from Spain forbidding a further step in the negotiation without express order from the King

 You will do your best to further it

 I have the deepest affection for the cause of the Duke of Savoy but I cannot further it so long as I cannot tell what his Majesty specifically is resolved to do and what hope is held out from Venice Germany and other quarters

 Vaudemont was at the head of a further force of cavalry and foot paid for by Spain and the Pope additional soldiers riders and infantry together had been gathered by Maximilian of Bavaria at the expense of the League

 We hope that nothing further will be asked of us no scruples be felt as to our good intentions he said and that if Spain and the Archdukes are not ready now to fulfil the treaty their Majesties will know how to resent this trifling with their authority and dignity and how to set matters to rights with their own hands in the duchies

 I protest he said further that I seek nothing in your state but all possible friendship and good fellowship

 His Majesty says further added the King that as he has been at various times admonished by me and is daily admonished by other princes that he ought to execute the treaty of Xanten by surrendering the city of Wesel and all other places occupied by Spinola he now declares himself ready to carry out that treaty in every point

 We hope wrote Barneveld that the alliance of his Highness the Prince of Wales with the daughter of the Spanish king will make no further progress as it will place us in the deepest embarrassment and pain

 He assured me again that he should not proceed further in the business without communicating it to his good friends and neighbours that he considered My Lords the States as his best friends and allies who ought therefore to conceive no jealousy in the matter

 Delays and excuses having followed instead of the punishment originally demanded James had now instructed his special envoy in case of further delay or evasion to repudiate all further friendship or intercourse with the Archduke to ratify the recall of his minister resident Trumbull and in effect to announce formal hostilities

 He pledged himself to that government that if the Protestants in Bohemia continued rebellious he would do his best to frustrate their designs and would induce his son in law to have no further connection with them

 Next day he came before the Assembly to express his sentiments to complain of the rudeness with which the resolution of th August had been communicated to him and to demand further explanations

 Amsterdam Enkhuyzen Flushing being without any effort of his own within his control he quietly slipped down the river Meuse on the night of the th September accompanied by his brother Frederic Henrys and before six o clock next morning had introduced a couple of companies of trustworthy troops into Brielle had summoned the magistrates before him and compelled them to desist from all further intention of levying mercenaries

 Moreover to obtain Union by stretching all the ancient historical privileges and liberties of the separate provinces upon the Procrustean bed of a single dogma to look for nationality only in common subjection to an infallible priesthood to accept a Catechism as the palladium upon which the safety of the State was to depend for all time and beyond which there was to be no further message from Heaven such was not healthy constitutionalism in the eyes of a great statesman

 No doubt that without the fervent spirit of Calvinism it would have been difficult to wage war with such immortal hate as the Netherlands had waged it no doubt the spirit of republican and even democratic liberty lay hidden within that rigid husk but it was dishonour to the martyrs who had died by thousands at the stake and on the battle field for the rights of conscience if the only result of their mighty warfare against wrong had been to substitute a new dogma for an old one to stifle for ever the right of free enquiry theological criticism and the hope of further light from on high and to proclaim it a libel on the Republic that within its borders all heretics whether Arminian or Papist were safe from the death penalty or even from bodily punishment

 He was further asked why he hated the Arminians so much

 They further reminded the council of state that by its institution the States Provincial had not abdicated their respective sovereignties but had reserved it in all matters not specifically mentioned in the original instruction by which it was created

 They however made oath to serve against those who should seek to trouble the peace of the Province of Utrecht in ecclesiastical or political matters and further against all enemies of the common country

 They further resolved that a legal provincial synod should be convoked by the States of Holland and under their authority and supervision

 They further resolved that as they were bound by solemn oath to maintain the laws and liberties of Holland they could not surrender this right to the Generality nor allow it to be usurped by any one but in order to settle the question of the Five Points the only cause known to them of the present disturbances they were content under their own authority to convoke a provincial synod within three months at their own cost and to invite the respective provinces as many of them as thought good to send to this meeting a certain number of pious and learned theologians

 Whereupon he shut the window and left van der Myle to make such application of the parable as he thought proper vouchsafing no further answer to Barneveld s communication

 It was further stated that the Catholics having in each town a church and free exercise of their religion would soon be in a great majority

 After a little further conversation in this vein the Prince grew more excited

 And further exhorting them to conciliation and compromise he enlarged on the effect of their internal dissensions on their exterior relations

 They were then informed that the world had no further need of their services and were allowed to bow themselves out of the presence

 He desired further that note might be taken of this declaration as record of his good and upright intentions

 The quick wited Grotius instantly discovered the device read the intelligence thus communicated in the proofsheets of Secundus and made use of the system to obtain further intelligence

 The canons the sentence and long prayers and orations in Latin by President Bogerman gladdened the souls of an immense multitude which were further enlivened by the decree that both Creed and Catechism had stood the test of several criticisms and come out unchanged by a single hair

 There need be no further mention of them here

 He had done his best to further and did not deny having inspired the advice given in the famous letters from the King of Great Britain to the States in that there should be mutual toleration and abstinence from discussion of disputed doctrines neither of them essential to salvation

 These feelings he said he had expressed fifty two years before to three eminent professors of theology in whom he confided and they had assured him that he might tranquilly continue in such belief without examining further

 He bade him further to communicate to the family the messages sent that night through Walaeus by the Stadholder

 The request caused much further grumbling but was complied with at last and the chest deposited on the deck

 No further incident occurred

 They had better be worms with a promise of further reward and an intimation she said and eat dirt for their food than crawl in so base a business

 His wife loathing his crime and spurning all further communication with him abandoned him to his fate

 History disdains to follow further the career of the renegade traitor end assassin

 From studying and investigating the sources of history with my own eyes I went a step further I refused the guidance of modern writers and proceeding from one point of presumption to another I came to the magnanimous conviction that I could not know history as I ought to know it unless I wrote it for myself

 His present work certainly is not a fair specimen of what he is able to accomplish and its failure or partial success ought only to inspirit him for further effort

 The further effort for which he was to be inspirited had already begun

 He had just published the first two volumes of his History of the Netherlands and was ready for the further labors of its continuation when the threats followed by the outbreak of the great civil contention in his native land brought him back from the struggles of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to the conflict of the nineteenth

 Seward to say and there would seem now no further motive for concealing the truth that I was told in Europe on what I regarded as reliable authority that there was reason to believe that on the receipt of Mr

 No further fault was found with him so far as appears in the discharge of his duties to which he must have devoted himself faithfully for he writes to me under the date of December I have worked harder in the discharge of this mission than I ever did in my life

 Jay entitled Motley s Appeal to History in which the propriety of the society s action is questioned and the wrong done to him insisted upon and further illustrated

 We dispatched a note of severe censure to Motley at once and ordered him to abstain from any further connection with that question

 The ground of my doubt has lain in the possibility of such a trip further disordering the circulation

 It is however quite likely that what you fear for the brain may have had its counterpart in the nerve structures of the eye and as he is short sighted this tendency may be further intensified

 The beautiful but shallow Tormes instead of proving a source of blessing and wealth to this part of Castile is of no further utility than to turn the wheels of various small water mills standing upon weirs of stone which at certain distances traverse the river

 Stay said he my dear friend I have heard of your society and will do my best to further its views

 Of this theory or rather conjecture as it is unsubstantiated by the slightest proof it is needless to take further notice than to observe that provided the Phoenician language as many of the TRULY LEARNED have supposed and almost proved was a dialect of the Hebrew or closely allied to it it were as unreasonable to suppose that the Basque is derived from it as that the Kamschatdale and Cherokee are dialects of the Greek or Latin

 A few days after I received an order to send two copies of the Testament to the office of the political governor with which I complied and in less than twenty four hours an alguazil arrived at the shop with a notice prohibiting the further sale of the work

 I will add one further word which is this that I do not understand that there is any place where an alteration of the social and political relations of the negro and the white man can be made except in the State Legislature not in the Congress of the United States and as I do not really apprehend the approach of any such thing myself and as Judge Douglas seems to be in constant horror that some such danger is rapidly approaching I propose as the best means to prevent it that the Judge be kept at home and placed in the State Legislature to fight the measure

 I will state without quoting further for all will have an opportunity of reading it hereafter that Judge Trumbull brings forward what he regards as sufficient evidence to substantiate this charge

 At a second trial he introduces the same witnesses who tell the same story as before and a third witness who tells the same thing and in addition gives further testimony corroborative of the charge

 If he does say they are false and forged I will then look further into it and presume I can procure the certificates of the proper officers that they are genuine copies

 Among the interrogatories that Judge Douglas propounded to me at Freeport there was one in about this language Are you opposed to the acquisition of any further territory to the United States unless slavery shall first be prohibited therein I answered as I thought in this way that I am not generally opposed to the acquisition of additional territory and that I would support a proposition for the acquisition of additional territory according as my supporting it was or was not calculated to aggravate this slavery question amongst us

 Consequently he was in favor of the acquisition of further territory as fast as we might need it in disregard of how it might affect the slavery question

 It is a power not under the control of the representatives of the people any further than they the President and the Senate can be considered the representatives of the people

 We go further than that we don t propose to disturb it where in one instance we think the Constitution would permit us

 I then went on and stated the other points decided in the case namely that the bringing of a negro into the State of Illinois and holding him in slavery for two years here was a matter in regard to which they would not decide whether it would make him free or not that they decided the further point that taking him into a United States Territory where slavery was prohibited by Act of Congress did not make him free because that Act of Congress as they held was unconstitutional

 Clay says a little further on I desire no concealment of my opinions in regard to the institution of slavery

 Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States old as well as new North as well as South

 We might by arresting the further spread of it and placing it where the fathers originally placed it put it where the public mind should rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction

 I have said and I repeat my wish is that the further spread of it may be arrested and that it may be where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction I have expressed that as my wish I entertain the opinion upon evidence sufficient to my mind that the fathers of this government placed that institution where the public mind did rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction

 And when I say that I desire to see the further spread of it arrested I only say I desire to see that done which the fathers have first done

 The King looked pleased with this encouragement coming as it did from so excellent authority and continued with good heart Now mark ye all we will try him further

 He made two or three further efforts to help himself but being promptly forestalled each time he finally gave up with a sigh of resignation and a murmured Beshrew me but I marvel they do not require to breathe for me also Slippered and wrapped in a sumptuous robe he laid himself down at last to rest but not to sleep for his head was too full of thoughts and the room too full of people

 After some further talk in which the Lord St

 The Lord Chancellor entered and knelt by the King s couch saying I have given order and according to the King s command the peers of the realm in their robes do now stand at the bar of the House where having confirmed the Duke of Norfolk s doom they humbly wait his majesty s further pleasure in the matter

 He very soon realised this fact and straightway busied himself about his own affairs without further thought of John Canty

 He said with a right royal burst of generosity Discomfort thyself no further lad

 So encouraged was he indeed that he spoke up and said in a quite hopeful voice Now am I persuaded that if your Majesty will but tax your memory yet a little further it will resolve the puzzle of the Great Seal a loss which was of moment yesterday although of none to day since its term of service ended with our late lord s life

 The under sheriff was about to remove his prisoner Tom gave him a sign to wait then he said Good sir I would look into this matter further

 Tom sighed and said There good soul trouble thyself no further thy power is departed out of thee

 Whilst they moved about with the light the King made good use of his eyes and took the bearings of what seemed to be a good sized stall at the further end of the place purposing to grope his way to it when he should be left to himself

 But the fourth time he groped a little further and his hand lightly swept against something soft and warm

 His Majesty s royalty was accepted without further question or discussion and the two little girls began at once to inquire into how he came to be where he was and how he came to be so unroyally clad and whither he was bound and all about his affairs

 Next there was a deal of bustle and preparation and much passing and repassing of officials through that part of the crowd that stood on the further side of the women and whilst this proceeded a deep hush gradually fell upon the people

 But now his trial came on to his great gratification and he thought he could welcome any sentence provided a further imprisonment should not be a part of it

 All knew that a further delay must follow for the King must be prepared and robed for the solemn ceremony but this delay would be pleasantly occupied by the assembling of the peers of the realm in their stately robes

 This humane and kindly Blue Law Code of two hundred and forty years ago stands all by itself with ages of bloody law on the further side of it and a century and three quarters of bloody English law on THIS side of it

 It does not appear that the Christians were further disturbed under his reign

 Further he was not fond of change nor unsteady but he loved to stay in the same places and to employ himself about the same things and after his paroxysms of headache he came immediately fresh and vigorous to his usual occupations

 Further I owe it to the gods that I was not hurried into any offence against any of them though I had a disposition which if opportunity had offered might have led me to do something of this kind but through their favor there never was such a concurrence of circumstances as put me to the trial

 Further I am thankful to the gods that I was not longer brought up with my grandfather s concubine and that I preserved the flower of my youth and that I did not make proof of my virility before the proper season but even deferred the time that I was subjected to a ruler and a father who was able to take away all pride from me and to bring me to the knowledge that it is possible for a man to live in a palace without wanting either guards or embroidered dresses or torches and statues and such like show but that it is in such a man s power to bring himself very near to the fashion of a private person without being for this reason either meaner in thought or more remiss in action with respect to the things which must be done for the public interest in a manner that befits a ruler

 And further let the deity which is in thee be the guardian of a living being manly and of ripe age and engaged in matter political and a Roman and a ruler who has taken his post like a man waiting for the signal which summons him from life and ready to go having need neither of oath nor of any man s testimony

 And further it traverses the whole universe and the surrounding vacuum and surveys its form and it extends itself into the infinity of time and embraces and comprehends the periodical renovation of all things and it comprehends that those who come after us will see nothing new nor have those before us seen anything more but in a manner he who is forty years old if he has any understanding at all has seen by virtue of the uniformity that prevails all things which have been and all that will be

 When thou art troubled about anything thou hast forgotten this that all things happen according to the universal nature and forgotten this that a man s wrongful act is nothing to thee and further thou hast forgotten this that everything which happens always happened so and will happen so and now happens so everywhere forgotten this too how close is the kinship between a man and the whole human race for it is a community not of a little blood or seed but of intelligence

 It is also conceivable that such changes have taken place changes in the order of things as we are compelled by the imperfection of language to call them but which are no changes and further it is certain that our knowledge of the true sequence of all actual phenomena as for instance the phenomena of generation growth and dissolution is and ever must be imperfect

 He stopped a short time at Logstown though the French were one hundred and fifty miles further up the river and directed his course to Piqua the great town of the Twightwees where Gist and Croghan had been so well received by the Miamis and the French flag struck in the council house

 The chiefs according to etiquette sat for some moments silent after he had concluded as if ruminating on what had been said or to give him time for further remark

 The envoy further added that in order to maintain the peace and amity between both empires his master expected that his brother of Blefuscu would give orders to have me sent back to Lilliput bound hand and foot to be punished as a traitor

 I thought it my part to obey and for fear of falling laid myself at full length upon the handkerchief with the remainder of which he lapped me up to the head for further security and in this manner carried me home to his house

 To confirm what I have now said and further to show the miserable effects of a confined education I shall here insert a passage which will hardly obtain belief

 In hopes to ingratiate myself further into his majesty s favour I told him of an invention discovered between three and four hundred years ago to make a certain powder into a heap of which the smallest spark of fire falling would kindle the whole in a moment although it were as big as a mountain and make it all fly up in the air together with a noise and agitation greater than thunder

 But further to confirm all I had said I entreated him to give order that my cabinet should be brought of which I had the key in my pocket for he had already informed me how the seamen disposed of my closet

 This advantage has enabled them to extend their discoveries much further than our astronomers in Europe for they have made a catalogue of ten thousand fixed stars whereas the largest of ours do not contain above one third part of that number

 When I gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants he made no further answer than by telling me that I had not been long enough among them to form a judgment and that the different nations of the world had different customs with other common topics to the same purpose

 His lordship added That he would not by any further particulars prevent the pleasure I should certainly take in viewing the grand academy whither he was resolved I should go

 And he proposed further that by employing spiders the charge of dyeing silks should be wholly saved whereof I was fully convinced when he showed me a vast number of flies most beautifully coloured wherewith he fed his spiders assuring us that the webs would take a tincture from them and as he had them of all hues he hoped to fit everybody s fancy as soon as he could find proper food for the flies of certain gums oils and other glutinous matter to give a strength and consistence to the threads

 A further account of the academy

 He received my proposition with more compliance than is usual among writers especially those of the projecting species professing he would be glad to receive further information

 A further account of Glubbdubdrib

 The spot as he described it was about the compass of a silver threepence but in the course of time grew larger and changed its colour for at twelve years old it became green so continued till five and twenty then turned to a deep blue at five and forty it grew coal black and as large as an English shilling but never admitted any further alteration

 After some further discourse which I then conjectured might relate to me the two friends took their leaves with the same compliment of striking each other s hoof and the gray made me signs that I should walk before him wherein I thought it prudent to comply till I could find a better director

 He asked me who made the ship and how it was possible that the Houyhnhnms of my country would leave it to the management of brutes My answer was that I durst proceed no further in my relation unless he would give me his word and honour that he would not be offended and then I would tell him the wonders I had so often promised

 I begged his honour would please to excuse me from proceeding any further because I was very certain that the account he expected from me would be highly displeasing

 Therefore he desired to be further satisfied what I meant by law and the dispensers thereof according to the present practice in my own country because he thought nature and reason were sufficient guides for a reasonable animal as we pretended to be in showing us what he ought to do and what to avoid

 I assured his honour that the law was a science in which I had not much conversed further than by employing advocates in vain upon some injustices that had been done me however I would give him all the satisfaction I was able

 My master further assured me which I also observed myself that in the fields where the shining stones abound the fiercest and most frequent battles are fought occasioned by perpetual inroads of the neighbouring Yahoos

 His honour had further observed that a female Yahoo would often stand behind a bank or a bush to gaze on the young males passing by and then appear and hide using many antic gestures and grimaces at which time it was observed that she had a most offensive smell and when any of the males advanced would slowly retire looking often back and with a counterfeit show of fear run off into some convenient place where she knew the male would follow her

 As I ought to have understood human nature much better than I supposed it possible for my master to do so it was easy to apply the character he gave of the Yahoos to myself and my countrymen and I believed I could yet make further discoveries from my own observation

 I could with great pleasure enlarge further upon the manners and virtues of this excellent people but intending in a short time to publish a volume by itself expressly upon that subject I refer the reader thither and in the mean time proceed to relate my own sad catastrophe

 After I had discovered this island I considered no further but resolved it should if possible be the first place of my banishment leaving the consequence to fortune

 But I forbear descanting further and rather leave the judicious reader to his own remarks and application

 His leisure time he used for further pursuit of the classical studies which he had begun at Harvard and his chief pleasure in life lay in writing out the results of his reading in simple condensed form for young or busy readers

 Some helmets had a further improvement called a BEVER from the Italian bevere to drink

 Arthur having had an opportunity of explaining to Guenever his great esteem for her merit was in the joy of his heart and was still further delighted by hearing from Merlin the late exploits of Gawain at London by means of which his immediate return to his dominions was rendered unnecessary and he was left at liberty to protract his stay at the court of Laodegan

 And then he came lower and watched how his own horse stood and suddenly he leapt on the further side of his horse from the knight

 The other with similar courtesy solemnly renounced all further projects of vengeance for his brother s death and the two knights now become fast friends embraced each other with the greatest cordiality

 The general satisfaction was still further increased by the discovery of the real culprit

 Tristram could not resolve to depart without some further communication with his beloved so he concealed himself in the forest till at last he contrived to attract her attention by means of twigs which he curiously peeled and sent down the stream under her window

 It is done said Sir Gawain I shall seek no further

 Then he cried Ah my lord Arthur will ye leave me here alone among mine enemies Comfort thyself said the king for in me is no further help for I will to the Isle of Avalon to heal me of my grievous wound

 And because I said I would vouch for it he would come before long and maintain his cause against both of them they imprisoned me in this cave and said that I should be put to death unless he came to deliver me by a certain day and that is no further off than to morrow and I have no one to send to seek him for me

 And one of them arose and as he came upon the road to meet her she passed by and he followed as fast as he could being on foot and the greater was his speed the further was she from him

 And he came to an open level plain and put spurs to his horse and the more he urged his horse the further was she from him

 Kay said he I engaged not to go further than thou thyself

 And he spake on this wise Elphin be it known to thee beyond a doubt that it is but folly for a man to trust in the virtues of his wife further than he can see her and that thou mayest be certain of thy wife s vileness behold her finger with thy signet ring upon it which was cut from her hand last night while she slept the sleep of intoxication

 It showed no further sign of fight and at daybreak the magic beasts disappeared

 Anbessa however received a fatal wound in one of his engagements and the Saracens being thus checked from further advance retired to Narbonne

 What further adventures he met with will be told in another chapter

 His bearing was however changed and he disclaimed all thoughts of further contest with one who he said had already conquered him by his courtesy

 Alas I see myself to day poor humbled miserable and destined perhaps to yet further afflictions

 His heart felt now no further influenced by the recollection of her than to be moved with an ardent desire to retrieve his fame by some distinguished exploit

 The knight s horse lay dead and it seemed as if another moment would end the combat for terror and fatigue had quite disabled the knight for further resistance

 And this led to the further admission that so far as we can know there may be no difference between the substance of matter and the substance of spirit Disquisitions p

 But once formed these crystals change no further

 But I shall be asked at once Do you mean to say that there is no difference between the habit of mind of a mathematician and that of a naturalist Do you imagine that Laplace might have been put into the Jardin des Plantes and Cuvier into the Observatory with equal advantage to the progress of the sciences they professed To which I would reply that nothing could be further from my thoughts

 Comte as his manner is contradicts himself two pages further on but that will hardly relieve him from the responsibility of such a paragraph as the above

 On the other hand there are persons not to be outdone in all loyalty and just respect for womankind but by nature hard of head and haters of delusion however charming who not only repudiate the new woman worship which so many sentimentalists and some philosophers are desirous of setting up but carrying their audacity further deny even the natural equality of the sexes

 Ask the man who is investigating any question profoundly and thoroughly be it historical philosophical philological physical literary or theological who is trying to make himself master of any abstract subject except perhaps political economy and geology both of which are intensely Anglican sciences whether he is not compelled to read half a dozen times as many German as English books And whether of these English books more than one in ten is the work of a fellow of a college or a professor of an English university Is this from any lack of power in the English as compared with the German mind The countrymen of Grote and of Mill of Faraday of Robert Brown of Lyell and of Darwin to go no further back than the contemporaries of men of middle age can afford to smile at such a suggestion

 Further we need what for want of a better name I must call Physical Geography

 So far as school education is concerned I want to go no further just now and I believe that such instruction would make an excellent introduction to that preparatory scientific training which as I have indicated is so essential for the successful pursuit of our most important professions

 That the study of nature further than was requisite for the satisfaction of everyday wants should have any bearing on human life was far from the thoughts of men thus trained

 I said further that even at that time a great and increasing attention was being paid to physical science in our schools and colleges and that most assuredly such attention must go on growing and increasing until education in these matters occupied a very much larger share of the time which is given to teaching and training than had been the case heretofore

 I must call your attention further to this fact that all the subjects of our thoughts all feelings and propositions leaving aside our sensations as the mere materials and occasions of thinking and feeling all our mental furniture may be classified under one of two heads as either within the province of the intellect something that can be put into propositions and affirmed or denied or as within the province of feeling or that which before the name was defiled was called the aesthetic side of our nature and which can neither be proved nor disproved but only felt and known

 But when I proceed to consider that these young men may be said to represent the great bulk of what the Colleges have to show for their enormous wealth plus at least a hundred and fifty pounds a year apiece which each undergraduate costs his parents or guardians I feel inclined to ask whether the rate in aid of the education of the wealthy and professional classes thus levied on the resources of the community is not after all a little heavy And still further I am tempted to inquire what has become of the indigent scholars the sons of the masses of the people whose daily labour just suffices to meet their daily wants for whose benefit these rich foundations were largely if not mainly instituted It seems as if Pharaoh s dream had been rigorously carried out and that even the fat scholar has eaten the lean one

 And I should like further to call your attention to the important circumstance that in thus proposing the exclusion of the study of such branches of knowledge as Zoology and Botany from those compulsory upon the medical student I am not for a moment suggesting their exclusion from the University

 I am justified therefore in looking forward to the time when the student who proposes to devote himself to medicine will come not absolutely raw and inexperienced as he is at present but in a certain state of preparation for further study and I look to the university to help him still further forward in that stage of preparation through the organisation of its biological department

 But so sure as it is that men live not by bread but by ideas so sure is it that the future of the world lies in the hands of those who are able to carry the interpretation of nature a step further than their predecessors so certain is it that the highest function of a university is to seek out those men cherish them and give their ability to serve their kind full play

 But as science made the marvellous progress which it did make at the latter end of the last and the beginning of the present century thinking men began to discern that under this title of Natural History there were included very heterogeneous constituents that for example geology and mineralogy were in many respects widely different from botany and zoology that a man might obtain an extensive knowledge of the structure and functions of plants and animals without having need to enter upon the study of geology or mineralogy and vice vers and further as knowledge advanced it became clear that there was a great analogy a very close alliance between those two sciences of botany and zoology which deal with human beings while they are much more widely separated from all other studies

 So far as I recollect Solomon makes use of the image for purposes of comparison but I will not proceed further into that matter

 The purpose of this course is not to make skilled dissectors but to give every student a clear and definite conception by means of sense images of the characteristic structure of each of the leading modifications of the animal kingdom and that is perfectly possible by going no further than the length of that list of forms which I have enumerated

 You are further aware that the men who come up to the University of London are the picked men of the medical schools of London and therefore such observations as I may have to make upon the state of knowledge of these gentlemen if they be justified in regard to any faults I may have to find cannot be held to indicate defects in the capacity or in the power of application of those gentlemen but must be laid more or less to the account of the prevalent system of medical education

 All the members of the late commission were agreed that these were the main points to be attended to in any proposals for the further improvement of medical training and qualification

 The plan would have the further advantage that all those corporate bodies which have obtained as many of them have a great and just prestige by the admirable way in which they have done their work would reap their just reward in the thronging of students thenceforward as formerly to obtain their qualifications while those who have neglected their duties who have in some one or two cases I am sorry to say absolutely disgraced themselves would sink into oblivion and come to a happy and natural euthanasia in which their misdeeds and themselves would be entirely forgotten

 Further than this it hardly went

 Upon my asking further if I might hence infer that the lawfulness of teaching any religious formulary in a rate school would thus depend exclusively on local circumstances and would accordingly be so decided by the Education Department in case of dispute I was informed in explanation that their lordships letter was intended to convey to me that no general rule beyond that stated in the first paragraph of their letter could at present be laid down by them and that their decision in each particular case must depend on the special circumstances accompanying it

 Further there can be no doubt that affection for the Being thus defined and described by theologic science would be properly termed religion but it would not be the whole of religion

 By the study of what other book could children be so much humanised and made to feel that each figure in that vast historical procession fills like themselves but a momentary space in the interval between two eternities and earns the blessings or the curses of all time according to its effort to do good and hate evil even as they also are earning their payment for their work On the whole then I am in favour of reading the Bible with such grammatical geographical and historical explanations by a lay teacher as may be needful with rigid exclusion of any further theological teaching than that contained in the Bible itself

 XVI TECHNICAL EDUCATION Any candid observer of the phenomena of modern society will readily admit that bores must be classed among the enemies of the human race and a little consideration will probably lead him to the further admission that no species of that extensive genus of noxious creatures is more objectionable than the educational bore

 Further I should like him to know the elements of physical science and especially of physics and chemistry and I should take care that this elementary knowledge was real

 And you will observe that in thus widening the definition of our object I have gone no further than the Mayor in his speech when he not obscurely hinted and most justly hinted that in dealing with this question there are other matters than technical education in the strict sense to be considered

 If it is found practicable to add further training of the hand and eye by instruction in modelling or in simple carpentry well and good

 Let me further call your attention to the fact that the terrible battle of competition between the different nations of the world is no transitory phenomenon and does not depend upon this or that fluctuation of the market or upon any condition that is likely to pass away

 I am not sure but a direct apology would be in better taste but the strength derived from the purpose I had in view in writing and publishing them sustains me without saying anything further by way of excuse

 There is a tale of joy and woe Round ev ry hearth in ev ry land Which ne er may ever further go Than round that humble home like band

 I entered the office and went up to him opened up my passport and said Before going further I wish to state that I am an American not too proud to fight and want to join your army

 With a look of contempt he further informed us that the allied anti aircraft shells when exploding emitted white smoke while the German shells gave forth black smoke and as he expressed it It must be an Allemand because our pom poms are shelling and I know our batteries are not off their bally nappers and are certainly not strafeing our own planes and another piece of advice don t chuck your weight about until you ve been up the line and learnt something

 Hereupon he set his right hand upon his cheek FN and he fell to weeping and suffered the first third of the dark hours to pass when he said to himself There remaineth naught of thy life save the remnant of this night But the while he was conjecturing and taking thought behold an army of the locusts to whom he had thrown the flour upon his road came speeding over him like a cloud dispread and said to him with the tongue of the case FN Fear not neither grieve for we have flocked hither to solace thee and ward from thee the woe wherein thou art so take thou no further heed

 Such was her case but now we will recount Inshallah what further befel her

 But as soon as Yusuf passed out of the palace door he took off the gown which was upon him and turband d it around his head together with his bow and quiver and he stinted not to stem the stream until he had reached the further bank where he found and greeted the lord Yahya and his Mamelukes

 One day of the days quoth I to him Come up with me to the Palace roof that we may gaze upon the view when we saw from its height a herd of gazelles and I cried Ah that I had one of these Hereat said he By Allah and by the life of thine eyes and by the blackness of their pupils I will in very deed fill thy Palace therewith and with such words he went forth and saddled his steed and swam the river to the further side where he rode down three roes within sight of me

 It proposes nothing save and except to restore this government to its original tone in regard to this element of slavery and there to maintain it looking for no further change in reference to it than that which the original framers of the Government themselves expected and looked forward to

 Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it and place it where the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction or its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the States old as well as new North as well as South

 I should expect it is true that judge Douglas had reminded you or informed you if you had never before heard it that I had once in my life declared it as my opinion that this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free that a house divided against itself cannot stand and as I had expressed it I did not expect the house to fall that I did not expect the Union to be dissolved but that I did expect that it would cease to be divided that it would become all one thing or all the other that either the opponents of slavery would arrest the further spread of it and place it where the public mind would rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction or the friends of slavery will push it forward until it becomes alike lawful in all the States old or new free as well as slave

 Whereas a joint committee of both houses of Congress has waited on the President of the United States and requested him to recommend a day of public humiliation prayer and fasting to be observed by the people of the United States with religious solemnities and the offering of fervent supplications to Almighty God for the safety and welfare of these States His blessings on their arms and a speedy restoration of peace and Whereas it is fit and becoming in all people at all times to acknowledge and revere the supreme government of God to bow in humble submission to His chastisements to confess and deplore their sins and transgressions in the full conviction that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and to pray with all fervency and contrition for the pardon of their past offences and for a blessing upon their present and prospective action and Whereas when our own beloved country once by the blessing of God united prosperous and happy is now afflicted with faction and civil war it is peculiarly fit for us to recognize the hand of God in this terrible visitation and in sorrowful remembrance of our own faults and crimes as a nation and as individuals to humble ourselves before Him and to pray for His mercy to pray that we may be spared further punishment though most justly deserved that our arms may be blessed and made effectual for the re establishment of order law and peace throughout the wide extent of our country and that the inestimable boon of civil and religious liberty earned under His guidance and blessing by the labors and sufferings of our fathers may be restored in all its original excellence Therefore I Abraham Lincoln President of the United States do appoint the last Thursday in September next as a day of humiliation prayer and fasting for all the people of the nation

 The Secretary of War will order that one or the other of the corps of General McDowell and General Sumner remain in front of Washington until further orders from the department to operate at or in the direction of Manassas Junction or otherwise as occasion may require that the other Corps not so ordered to remain go forward to General McClellan as speedily as possible that General McClellan commence his forward movements from his new base at once and that such incidental modifications as the foregoing may render proper be also made

 FURTHER REPRIMAND OF McCLELLAN TO GENERAL G

 Whereas by my proclamation of the th of April one thousand eight hundred and sixty one it was declared that the ports of certain States including those of Beaufort in the State of North Carolina Port Royal in the State of South Carolina and New Orleans in the State of Louisiana were for reasons therein set forth intended to be placed under blockade and whereas the said ports of Beaufort Port Royal and New Orleans have since been blockaded but as the blockade of the same ports may now be safely relaxed with advantage to the interests of commerce Now therefore be it known that I Abraham Lincoln President of the United States pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section of the act of Congress approved on the th of July last entitled An act further to provide for the collection of duties on imports and for other purposes do hereby declare that the blockade of the said ports of Beaufort Port Royal and New Orleans shall so far cease and determine from and after the first day of June next that commercial intercourse with those ports except as to persons things and information contraband of war may from that time be carried on subject to the laws of the United States and to the limitations and in pursuance of the regulations which are prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury in his order of this date which is appended to this proclamation

 Thereupon he returned to Tarabulus but as he drew near thereto he was met outside the city by a bevy of small boys who were playing at forfeits and lo and behold cried one to his comrades O lads do ye remember such and such a year when our Kazi was brought to bed FN But the Judge hearing these words returned forthright to Damascus by the way he came saying to himself Hie thee not save to Baghdad city for tis further away than Damascus and set out at once for the House of Peace

 The object of the federations he said will be to guarantee as far as possible the beneficent reign of peace and they will have the further effect of securing in every nation the triumph of liberty over despotism

 This then is the first point settled property in product if we grant so much does not carry with it property in the means of production that seems to me to need no further demonstration

 But the land considering the productive power of its inhabitants and their ability to multiply is very limited further by the immense variety of products and the extreme division of labor the social task is made easy of accomplishment

 Further numerous difficulties relative to the police system and the organization of industry might be raised here

 Everything might depend on it and so in answer to Mr Harding s further consolation the archdeacon suggested that a telegraph message should be immediately sent off to London

 When he left the hospital from which he had been so ruthlessly driven and settled himself down in his own modest manner in the High Street of Barchester he had not expected that others would make more fuss about it than he was inclined to do himself and the extent of his hope was that the movement might have been made in time to prevent any further paragraphs in the Jupiter

 In truth Mr Slope having made a declaration of affection afterwards withdrew it on finding that the doctor had no immediate worldly funds with which to endow his child and it may easily be conceived that Miss Proudie after such an announcement on his part was not readily disposed to receive any further show of affection

 He brought with him some models which he had originated at Rome and which really gave much fair promise that his father was induced to go to further expense in furthering these views

 La Signora Madeline Vicinironi who having no legs to stand on had bespoken a sofa in his drawing room who could she be He however could now make no further inquiry as Dr and Mrs Stanhope were announced

 The matter however had become too tedious for the readers of the Jupiter and a little note had therefore been appended to one of Mr Slope s most telling rejoinders in which it had been stated that no further letters from the reverend gentlemen could be inserted except as advertisements

 The next morning Mr Harding returned to Barchester no further word having been spoken in his hearing respecting Mr Slope s acquaintance with his younger daughter

 Twelve hundred a year of her own said Slope and very shortly afterwards took his leave avoiding as far as it was possible for him to do any further allusion to the hospital

 Mr Slope had thus left her quite bewildered and could not willingly admit into his brain any scheme a part of which would be the necessity of abandoning all further special relationship with this lady

 Have not often the profoundest efforts of genius been used to baffle the aspirations of the reader to raise false hopes and false fears and to give rise to expectations which are never realised Are not promises all but made of delightful horrors in lieu of which the writer produces nothing but commonplace realities in his final chapter And is there not a species of deceit in this to which the honesty of the present age should lend no countenance And what can be the worth of that solicitude which a peep into the third volume can utterly dissipate What the value of those literary charms which are absolutely destroyed by their enjoyment When we have once learnt what was the picture before which was hung Mrs Radcliffe s solemn curtain we feel no further interest about either the frame or the veil

 I fear an interview would lead to further ill will

 He had a feeling that if he ever meant to oppose the now almost unendurable despotism of his wife he must lose no further time in doing so that if he even meant to be himself master in his own diocese let alone his own house he should begin at once

 Let photographers and daguerreotypers do what they will and improve as they may with further skill on that which skill has already done they will never achieve a portrait of the human face as we may under the burdens which we so often feel too heavy for our shoulders we must either bear them up like men or own ourselves too weak for the work we have undertaken

 Nothing further was said about him

 Poor Mr Harding felt himself completely snubbed and of course said nothing further but Mr Arabin who had yielded submissively in the small matters of the cellar and kitchen grate found himself obliged to oppose reforms which might be of a nature too expensive for his pocket

 It was further agreed also that they would lunch at the squire s house and return home after the afternoon service

 That further feminine step in advance which combines paint and petticoats together had not found votary in Miss Thorne

 From the gateway two paths led obliquely across the court that to the left reaching the hall door which was in the corner made by the angle of the house and that to the right leading to the back entrance which was at the further end of the longer portion of the building

 At the further end of the room was a huge fire place which afforded much ground of difference between the brother and sister

 He wrote again to the bishop expressing a hope that nothing further would be done in the matter of the hospital till the consideration promised by his lordship had been given and then sent off a warm appeal to his friend the master imploring him to come to Plumstead and assist in driving the bishop into compliance

 With the object of carrying this point he rode over to Puddingdale and had a further interview with the worthy expectant of clerical good things

 Did I Did I go so far as that Well perhaps it may be that in my anxiety on your behalf I did commit myself further than I should have done

 Ah forgetful inexperienced man Can you cause that little trembling victim to be divorced from the woman who possesses him Can you provide that they shall be separated at bed and board Is he not flesh of her flesh and bone of her bone and must he not so continue It is very well now for you to stand your ground and triumph as she is driven ignominiously from the room but can you be present when those curtains are drawn when that awful helmet of proof has been tied beneath the chin when the small remnants of the bishop s prowess shall be cowed by the tassel above his head Can you then intrude yourself when the wife wishes to speak to my lord alone But for the moment Mr Slope s triumph was complete for Mrs Proudie without further parley left the room and did not forget to shut the door after her

 I much fear that I can do nothing further for you in this matter

 If you have nothing further to say I shall be obliged by being permitted to say good night I am very tired

 But I have done my duty I can do nothing further

 Why indeed should he have wished to have aught further to say to the future wife of Mr Slope I am sorry to hear that you are too leave so soon said he striving in vain to use his ordinary voice

 But if not To speak sooth however his sufferings on that dreadful night had been as poignant as to leave him little spirit for further rebellion

 The bishop said nothing further to excuse either himself or his chaplain and having shown himself passive and docile was again taken into favour

 The Stanhope party was finally arranged in the odious manner already described and Eleanor got into the doctor s waiting carriage full of apprehension and presentiment of further misfortunes whereas Mr Slope entered the vehicle elate with triumph

 Miss Thorne said nothing further

 But she saw that it was useless for her to push the matter further

 Was it after all true that she had been conducting herself in a way that justified the world in thinking that she liked the man After all could it be possible that the archdeacon and Mr Arabin were right and that she was wrong Charlotte Stanhope had also been watching Mr Slope and had come to the conclusion that it behoved her brother to lose no further time if he meant to gain the widow

 Eleanor was however spared any further immediate degradation for Dr Stanhope gave her his arm across the courtyard and Mr Slope was fain to throw away his attention upon Charlotte

 There were targets and bows and arrows prepared at the further end of the lawn

 Miss Thorne sighed but said nothing further

 Any further conversation between these congenial souls was prevented by the advent of Mr Thorne who came to lead the countess to the tent

 A glance a word a motion suffices by some such acute exercise of her feminine senses the signora was aware that Mr Arabin loved Eleanor Bold and therefore by a further exercise of her peculiar feminine propensities it was quite natural for her to entrap Mr Arabin into her net

 But Not a word further

 I will not hear a word further

 Mr Arabin bowed to Mr Slope began eating his food without saying a word further

 If we greet at that what ll we do when true sorrow comes across us How would you be now dame if the boy there had broke his neck when he got the tumble Mrs Greenacre was humbled and said nothing further on the matter

 Such being the state of the case it was not to be supposed that Mr Plomacy could refuse such a favour to Mr Greenacre but nevertheless he not grant it without some further show of austere authority

 What have I done that you should pass on me so severe a sentence and then he paused a moment during which the widow walked steadily on with measured step saying nothing further

 Mr Slope had no further desire to converse with the master of Lazarus and was very soon on his road back to Barchester

 Eleanor as we have said having declared her intention of never holding further communication with Mr Slope ran hurriedly back towards the house

 Was she to wait there till Mr Slope caught her or was she to go in among the crowd with tears in her eyes and passion in her face She might in truth have stood there long enough without any reasonable fear of further immediate persecution from Mr Slope but we are all inclined to magnify the bugbears which frighten us

 Bertie was to be told in confidence of the whole affair and when the carriage was gone off with the first load Eleanor was to be left under Bertie s special protection so as to insure her from any further aggression from Mr Slope

 And then Mr Arabin finding it impossible to say anything further stood silent till Charlotte had completed her plans and Mrs Bold stood equally silent intently occupied as it appeared in the arrangement of her rings

 He was comfortably ensconced in the ha ha with his back to the sloping side smoking a cigar and eagerly engaged in conversation with some youngster from the further side of the county whom he had never met before who was also smoking under Bertie s pupilage and listening with open ears to an account given by his companion of some of the pastimes of the Eastern clime

 If a man gave him credit that was the man s look out Bertie Stanhope troubled himself nothing further

 It may be taken as a faithful promise that no further letter whatever shall be transcribed at length in these pages

 But Bertie who was close to the door and heard the call required no further bidding but walked in with a perfectly unconcerned and cheerful air

 No I shall suggest nothing further

 Bertie deprived of his occupation threw himself back in his chair and waited further orders

 He dreamed of that soft hand which had kissed so often and of the imperial brow which his lips had once pressed and he then dreamed also of further favours

 The archdeacon groaned deeply but he had no further answer to make

 He had not come over to Plumstead to have further contention with his son in law about Mr Slope so he allowed it to pass by

 But perplexed as he was he was doomed to further perplexity

 Think of it how she would she could not but accept it as a fact that Mr Arabin was fond of her and then when she went further and asked herself the question she could not but accept it as a fact also that she was fond of him

 When Miss Thorne went a little further and declared that she did not know a prettier vicarage house in the country than St Ewold s Mrs Bold remembering the projected bow window and the projected priestess still held her tongue though her ears tingled with the conviction that all the world would know that she was in love with Mr Arabin

 Then it appeared that he had nothing further to say so after gazing for a moment in silence at the brightness of the setting sun he returned to the fire

 My Nelly my child my happy happy child We need not pursue the interview any further

 Of her and her happiness of Mr Arabin and his virtues he would talk as much as Eleanor desired and to tell the truth that was not a little but about the deanery he would now say nothing further

 There shall be no mystery with you archdeacon though of course it must go no further at present

 Well well well well said the archdeacon loudly joyously and with supreme good humour well well well well so after all we have no further cause to fear Mr Slope

 Of the bishop and his wife very little further need be said

 Very speedily a further vacancy on the bench of bishops gave Dr Proudie the seat in the House of Lords which he at first so anxiously longed for

 But But But said Mr Harding and then failing to get any further he looked imploringly at the archdeacon

 There is now nothing else to be told but the gala doings of Mr Arabin s marriage nothing more to be described than the wedding dresses no further dialogue to be recorded than that which took place between the archdeacon who married them and Mr Arabin and Eleanor who were married

 Dear sir of force I must attempt you further Take some remembrance of us as a tribute Not as fee

 And Tyeglev had guessed three This incident strengthened still further his reputation as a mysterious fatal character

 Before the doors of our barn stretched a wide plain gradually sloping away in the distance a little river gleamed here and there in the winding hollows low growing woods could be seen further on the horizon

 I went a few steps further

 Further search led to nothing and I went back to the hut with the comb in my hand and my cheeks tingling

 Where are you going Have you only just come And what is the letter Do you promise to deliver it said Tyeglev and moved away a few steps further

 but first Tyeglev moved still further away and became a long dark blur

 For five or six steps all round it was a little transparent but further away it stood up like a wall thick and white like cotton wool

 Ilya Stepanitch Tyeglev My voice died away near me without an answer it seemed as though the fog would not let it go further

 Semyon and I shouted several times into the shanty something stirred at the further end of it the straw rustled and a hoarse voice shouted I am on guard

 Further on he had alluded to destiny to persecution to his vocation which had remained unfulfilled to a mystery which he would bear with him to the grave to people who had not cared to understand him he had even quoted lines from some poet who had said of the crowd that it wore life like a dog collar and clung to vice like a burdock and it was not free from mistakes in spelling

 Once or twice he stopped listened and stole on further

 VII This new acquaintance whom we will call Emilie led him through a dark damp little lobby into a fairly large but low pitched and untidy room with a huge cupboard against the further wall and a sofa covered with American leather above the doors and between the windows hung three portraits in oils with the paint peeling off two representing bishops in clerical caps and one a Turk in a turban cardboard boxes were lying about in the corners there were chairs of different sorts and a crooked legged card table on which a man s cap was lying beside an unfinished glass of kvass

 She moved away to the further end of the sofa and drew her feet up under her

 XXI Colibri stood on the further side of the table and running her fingers several times over the strings of the guitar and to the surprise of Kuzma Vassilyevitch who was expecting a lively merry song began singing a slow monotonous air accompanying each separate sound which seemed as though it were wrung out of her by force with a rhythmical swaying of her body to right and left

 I thanked the old man and without further discussion ordered my carriage and drove to Belyov

 Brother Porfiry Petrovitch observed my aunt as soon as she noticed not without regret that my father s anger had so to speak flickered out don t you worry yourself further it s not worth dirtying your hands over

 I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty five and I don t reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever

 After that the talk got further and further away and I couldn t make out the words any more but I could hear the mumble and now and then a laugh too but it seemed a long ways off

 A big double loaf come along and I most got it with a long stick but my foot slipped and she floated out further

 I could hear the booming now and then further and further off and by and by after an hour I didn t hear it no more

 I never waited for to look further but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever I could

 I slunk along another piece further then listened again and so on and so on

 It would get so dark that it looked all blue black outside and lovely and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider webby and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild and next when it was just about the bluest and blackest FST it was as bright as glory and you d have a little glimpse of tree tops a plunging about away off yonder in the storm hundreds of yards further than you could see before dark as sin again in a second and now you d hear the thunder let go with an awful crash and then go rumbling grumbling tumbling down the sky towards the under side of the world like rolling empty barrels down stairs where it s long stairs and they bounce a good deal you know

 Goshen s ten mile further up the river

 Jim said he didn t believe he could go any further so scared he hadn t hardly any strength left he said

 I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times to keep from knocking the islands out of the river and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing it was floating a little faster than what I was

 We heard them come along towards the crick but couldn t see them they seemed to stop and fool around a while then as we got further and further away all the time we couldn t hardly hear them at all by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river everything was quiet and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe

 And at last when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven whilst I was stealing a poor old woman s nigger that hadn t ever done me no harm and now was showing me there s One that s always on the lookout and ain t a going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared

 Then I struck up the road and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it Phelps s Sawmill and when I come to the farm houses two or three hundred yards further along I kept my eyes peeled but didn t see nobody around though it was good daylight now

 So we crept to the door and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack but couldn t make out nothing it was so dark and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further and when he nudged us Jim must glide out first and him last

 But they was all locked and chained so he took my canoe and said for me to wait till he come back or I could hunt around further or maybe I better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to

 There among some young pine trees and furze bushes I stopped panting and waited further developments

 The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened

 At last I could go no further I was exhausted with the violence of my emotion and of my flight and I staggered and fell by the wayside

 There was very little excitement in the station as the officials failing to realise that anything further than a breakdown between Byfleet and Woking junction had occurred were running the theatre trains which usually passed through Woking round by Virginia Water or Guildford

 The Sunday papers printed separate editions as further news came to hand some even in default of it

 Any further cylinders that fell it was hoped could be destroyed at once by high explosives which were being rapidly manufactured and distributed

 The front tire of the machine he got was punctured in dragging it through the window but he got up and off notwithstanding with no further injury than a cut wrist

 And while I am engaged in this description I may add in this place certain further details which although they were not all evident to us at the time will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them to form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures

 The trees near me were dead and brown but further a network of red thread scaled the still living stems

 They ain t no further use

 The terrible disasters at the Ealing and South Kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further investigations upon the latter

 Now we see further

 You should think about this further

 Hurriedly they now both ran along the path in order to reach people and got near to the ferry there Kamala collapsed and was not able to go any further

 All its further development belongs to the Athenians

 Many poets followed in the same path more action was given to the dramatic parts and greater variety to the music in which the airs were agreeably blended with the recitative duets other harmonized pieces were also added and after the lapse of a century Apostolo Zeno still further improved the melodrama

 He had more political philosophical and elegant learning than any man of his age and made further advances in some of the exact sciences

 In truth these old Spanish chronicles cannot be compared with those of any other nation and whether they have their foundation in truth or in fable they strike their strong roots further down into the deep soil of popular feeling and character

 Spanish students repaired to the famous universities of Italy and returned to Spain bringing with them the influence of Italian culture and commercial and political relations still further promoted a free communication of the manners and literature of Italy to Spain

 These discoveries roused the zeal of the Scandinavian literati and led to further investigations which resulted in the discovery of a vast number of chronicles and sagas and much has since been done by the learned men of Iceland and Denmark to bring to light the remote annals of northern Europe

 Yet there are politicians in England so grossly ignorant of the German reading of the Napoleonic lessons that they expect that Nation to sacrifice the enormous advantage they have prepared by a whole century of self sacrifice and practical patriotism by an appeal to a Court of Arbitration and the further delays which must arise by going through the medieaeval formalities of recalling Ambassadors and exchanging ultimatums

 the Crown Prince tended further to give his investigations and studies that direction and to lead him to put down in writing whatever conclusions he arrived at

 My ultimate view has now been to go through the whole once more to establish by further explanation much of the earlier treatises and perhaps to condense into results many analyses on the later ones and thus to make a moderate whole out of it forming a small octavo volume

 This revision has been inserted in the place intended for it in the first book for it does not go any further 

 All doubt is now at an end your troops do not come up you are too weak march I must and I must excuse myself from further negotiation which may cost me my head

 Each strives by physical force to compel the other to submit to his will each endeavours to throw his adversary and thus render him incapable of further resistance

 Further the co operation of allies does not depend on the Will of the belligerents and from the nature of the political relations of states to each other this co operation is frequently not afforded until after the War has commenced or it may be increased to restore the balance of power

 Further the smaller our political object the less value shall we set upon it and the more easily shall we be induced to give it up altogether

 FREQUENT PERIODS OF INACTION IN WAR REMOVE IT FURTHER FROM THE ABSOLUTE AND MAKE IT STILL MORE A CALCULATION OF PROBABILITIES

 Nay further if we look at the case in the concrete then we must say that in a whole class of cases the idea of a complete defeat of the enemy would be a mere imaginative flight especially when the enemy is considerably superior

 Still more general in its influence on the resolution to peace is the consideration of the expenditure of force already made and further required

 We cannot at present pursue this subject further than to observe that from this negative intention are to be deduced all the advantages and all the stronger forms of combat which are on the side of the Defensive and in which that philosophical dynamic law which exists between the greatness and the certainty of success is realised

 Further the motive of the fight therefore its object forms its unit

 Here the number of possible relations and consequently possible combinations is much greater the diversity of measures increased and by the gradation of objects each subordinate to another the first means employed is further apart from the ultimate object

 If we go further in the demands which War makes on it then we find the powers of the understanding predominating

 With our weak philosophy we shall not proceed further in this mysterious field

 Further every War is rich in particular facts while at the same time each is an unexplored sea full of rocks which the General may have a suspicion of but which he has never seen with his eye and round which moreover he must steer in the night

 If this fighting was a single act there would be no necessity for any further subdivision but the fight is composed of a greater or less number of single acts complete in themselves which we call combats as we have shown in the first chapter of the first book and which form new units

 Further according to a division of the subject in AGREEMENT WITH ITS NATURE the difficulties are not everywhere the same but diminish the more results manifest themselves in the material world and increase the more they pass into the moral and become motives which influence the will

 The time of day influences the combat by the difference between day and night but the influence naturally extends further than merely to the limits of these divisions as every combat has a certain duration and great battles last for several hours

 If it is further established in theory that a divided attack diminishes the probability of success still it would be just as unreasonable whenever there is a divided attack and an unsuccessful issue to regard the latter as the result of the former without further investigation into the connection between the two as where a divided attack is successful to infer from it the fallacy of that theoretical principle

 What the history of the Art of War is we have already said and we shall further explain our views on examples and on military history in general in special chapters

 In the latter we are hurried on with the moment a Commander feels himself borne along in a strong current against which he durst not contend without the most destructive consequences he suppresses the rising fears and boldly ventures further

 Marches to turn a flank right or left are easily combined the idea of keeping a small force always well concentrated to be able to meet the enemy on equal terms at any point to multiply a force by rapid movement is as easily conceived as expressed the mere contrivance in these points therefore cannot excite our admiration and with respect to such simple things there is nothing further than to admit that they are simple

 If a detachment is sent away to cut off the retreat of a flying enemy and the enemy surrenders in consequence without further resistance still it is through the combat which is offered to him by this detachment sent after him that he is brought to his decision

 Nevertheless the point of view from which we must look at all this is that through these causes the forces and defensive means of Buonaparte were suddenly very much diminished the superiority of the Allies therefore just in the same measure increased and any further resistance then became IMPOSSIBLE

 Heaven preserve every theorist from such an undertaking We shall keep to the world of things in their totality and not pursue our analysis further than is necessary from time to time to give distinctness to the idea which we wish to impart and which has come to us not by a speculative investigation but through the impression made by the realities of War in their entirety

 Further out of regard to all other so called rules theory cannot banish the moral forces beyond its frontier because the effects of the physical forces and the moral are completely fused and are not to be decomposed like a metal alloy by a chemical process

 It is true however that in modern times the Armies of European states have arrived very much at a par as regards discipline and fitness for service and that the conduct of War has as philosophers would say naturally developed itself thereby become a method common as it were to all Armies so that even from Commanders there is nothing further to be expected in the way of application of special means of Art in the limited sense such as Frederick the Second s oblique order 

 Further there is hardly any celebrated enterprise in War which was not achieved by endless exertion pains and privations and as here the weakness of the physical and moral man is ever disposed to yield only an immense force of will which manifests itself in perseverance admired by present and future generations can conduct to our goal

 Let loose from all further calculations freed from all concern for the future boldness and stratagem intensify each other and thus collect at one point an infinitesimal glimmering of hope into a single ray which may likewise serve to kindle a flame

 The assumption that the men merely on account of their greater number would lose twice as many as would have lost in their place is certainly not correct therefore the greater loss which the side suffers that has placed the half of its force in reserve must be regarded as a disadvantage in that original formation further it must be admitted that in the generality of cases the men would have the advantage at the first commencement of being able to drive their opponent out of his position and force him to a retrograde movement now whether these two advantages are a counterpoise to the disadvantage of finding ourselves with men to a certain extent disorganised by the combat opposed to an enemy who is not materially weaker in numbers and who has quite fresh troops is one that cannot be decided by pursuing an analysis further we must here rely upon experience and there will scarcely be an officer experienced in War who will not in the generality of cases assign the advantage to that side which has the fresh troops

 Further the distances are so great that the probability of hitting the right point at last even with the best arrangements is but small

 Since all methods formerly usual were upset by Buonaparte s luck and boldness and first rate Powers almost wiped out at a blow since the Spaniards by their stubborn resistance have shown what the general arming of a nation and insurgent measures on a great scale can effect in spite of weakness and porousness of individual parts since Russia by the campaign of has taught us first that an Empire of great dimensions is not to be conquered which might have been easily known before secondly that the probability of final success does not in all cases diminish in the same measure as battles capitals and provinces are lost which was formerly an incontrovertible principle with all diplomatists and therefore made them always ready to enter at once into some bad temporary peace but that a nation is often strongest in the heart of its country if the enemy s offensive power has exhausted itself and with what enormous force the defensive then springs over to the offensive further since Prussia has shown that sudden efforts may add to an Army sixfold by means of the militia and that this militia is just as fit for service abroad as in its own country since all these events have shown what an enormous factor the heart and sentiments of a Nation may be in the product of its political and military strength in fine since governments have found out all these additional aids it is not to be expected that they will let them lie idle in future Wars whether it be that danger threatens their own existence or that restless ambition drives them on

 But this speculative distinction which we have made is also necessary for our further progress in the construction of our theory because all that we have to say on the relation of attack and defence and on the completion of this double sided act concerns the state of the crisis in which the forces are placed during the tension and motion and because all the activity which can take place during the condition of equilibrium can only be regarded and treated as a corollary for that crisis is the real War and this state of equilibrium only its reflection

 On the beaten side the loss of all order and control often makes the prolongation of resistance by individual units by the further punishment they are certain to suffer more injurious than useful to the whole

 The risk of having to fight on two sides and the still more dangerous position of having no line of retreat left open paralyse the movements and the power of resistance further in case of defeat they increase the loss often raising it to its extreme point that is to destruction

 A rout only sets in when the moral force of the defeated is very severely shaken then there often ensues a complete incapability of further resistance and the whole action consists of giving way that is of flight

 But this pretended object is not the real one and our present question is only as to the latter therefore we must to the above three objects of the offensive further add a fourth which is to lead the enemy to make a false conclusion

 But in all other cases when these two circumstances have not already decided the combat therefore particularly in case the destruction of the enemy s force is the principal object the decision is reached at that moment when the conqueror ceases to feel himself in a state of disintegration that is of unserviceableness to a certain extent when therefore there is no further advantage in using the successive efforts spoken of in the twelfth chapter of the third book

 Further the moment when the crisis stage of the combat ceases with the conqueror and his original state of order is restored takes place sooner the smaller the unit he controls

 It is said the key of the position is lost it cannot therefore be defended any further the battle cannot be continued

 If at the moment of each decisive tendency of a battle it should be considered as lost then also no further forces should be used to give it a turn and consequently this decisive tendency could not precede the retreat by any length of time

 It is therefore found that the vanquished sinks much further below the original line of equilibrium than the conqueror raises himself above it on this account if we speak of the effects of victory we allude more particularly to those which manifest themselves in the army

 Neither can usually be found at once and therefore the pursuit can be carried further generally however it does not extend beyond the distance of one or at most a couple of leagues because otherwise the advance guard would not feel itself sufficiently supported

 Whatever further encounter now takes place with the enemy is a new battle not a continuation of the old and although it may be far from promising absolute success still it is a fresh combat and not merely a gathering up of the debris by the victor

 This first pursuit as far as the nearest stopping point belongs as a right to every conqueror and is hardly in any way connected with his further plans and combinations

 Nothing seemed more natural to them than to stop the combat as soon as the decision was obtained and to regard all further carnage as unnecessary cruelty

 But this calculation was still so far false as the further loss of forces by a continuance of the pursuit could bear no proportion to that which the enemy must suffer

 The victory was decided at four o clock in the afternoon but the Russians still occupied the greater part of the field of battle they were not yet disposed to give up the ground and if the attack had been renewed they would still have offered a most determined resistance which would have undoubtedly ended in their complete defeat but would have cost the conqueror much further bloodshed

 But further the effects of victory are very seldom found to stop with this first pursuit now first begins the real career to which victory lent velocity

 In the further stages of pursuit again we can distinguish three degrees the simple pursuit a hard pursuit and a parallel march to intercept

 If for instance instead of contenting ourselves with taking up every day the camp the enemy has just vacated occupying just as much of the country as he chooses to abandon we make our arrangements so as every day to encroach further and accordingly with our advance guard organised for the purpose attack his rear guard every time it attempts to halt then such a course will hasten his retreat and consequently tend to increase his disorganisation

 If the conqueror scares away the discomfited opponent at sunset from a camp which has just been taken up either for the main body of the Army or for the rear guard the conquered must either make a night march or alter his position in the night retiring further away which is much the same thing the victorious party can on the other hand pass the night in quiet

 Every defeated Army will naturally have behind it at a greater or less distance some point the attainment of which is the first purpose in view whether it be that failing in this its further retreat might be compromised as in the case of a defile or that it is important for the point itself to reach it before the enemy as in the case of a great city magazines c

 All these difficulties obviously become increased as the power of the weapons in use tends to keep the combatants further apart

 A harsher man would rejoice now in the power I have of turning upon your aunt by going no further in the business

 She did not turn her head to look at a group of dark creatures further on who fled from her presence as she skirted a ravine where they fed

 Further ahead were dimly visible an irregular dwelling house garden and outbuildings backed by a clump of firs

 The distance to the boy s house was not more than three eighths of a mile his father s cottage and one other a few yards further on forming part of the small hamlet of Mistover Knap the third and only remaining house was that of Captain Vye and Eustacia which stood quite away from the small cottages

 A light came from the interior and threw a moving shadow upon the vertical face of gravel at the further side of the pit into which the vehicle faced

 During the interval he had shifted his position even further from hers than it had originally been by adopting the reddle trade though he was really in very good circumstances still

 No it is not that I am not in a humour to hear you further

 Yeobright appeared disinclined to enter further into the question

 This brought her to a spot in which the green bottom of the dale began to widen the furze bushes to recede yet further from the path on each side till they were diminished to an isolated one here and there by the increasing fertility of the soil

 The open hills were airy and clear and the remote atmosphere appeared as it often appears on a fine winter day in distinct planes of illumination independently toned the rays which lit the nearer tracts of landscape streaming visibly across those further off a stratum of ensaffroned light was imposed on a stratum of deep blue and behind these lay still remoter scenes wrapped in frigid grey

 The earnestness with which Thomasin spoke prevented further objections

 Joe s sweetheart straight way placed brilliant silk on the scallops of the hem in question and going a little further added ribbon tufts to the shoulder pieces

 They stood together minute after minute without further speech each looking at the blackening scene and each thinking his and her own thoughts

 Every now and then a long low note from the serpent which was the chief wind instrument played at these times advanced further into the heath than the thin treble part and reached their ears alone and next a more than usual loud tread from a dancer would come the same way

 On the further side of a table bearing candles she could faintly discern faces and that was all

 The man for whom she had pre determined to nourish a passion went into the small room and across it to the further extremity

 I wish not to be further recognized

 It was a mere notion of mine she said quietly and was about to pass by without further speech when looking round to the right she saw a painfully well known figure serpentining upwards by one of the little paths which led to the top where she stood

 After some thought I have decided once and for all that we must hold no further communication

 A few steps further and she looked back

 It was eleven o clock when he came in though he had not been further than the precincts of the garden

 And as he walked further and further from the charmed atmosphere of his Olympian girl his face grew sad with a new sort of sadness

 He journeyed on about a mile further to the village in which the owner lived and returning with him to the house arrangements were completed and the man undertook that one room at least should be ready for occupation the next day

 On further thought she deemed it advisable to tell Christian precisely what the two bags contained that he might be fully impressed with their importance

 When commencing the game his intention had been nothing further than a bitter practical joke on Mrs

 About the same moment that Wildeve stepped into the highway Venn also had reached it at a point a hundred yards further on and he hearing the same wheels likewise waited till the carriage should come up

 She imagined how all those Budmouth ones who should learn what had become of her would say Look at the girl for whom nobody was good enough To Eustacia the situation seemed such a mockery of her hopes that death appeared the only door of relief if the satire of Heaven should go much further

 Having watched the company through the figures of two dances she decided to walk a little further to a cottage where she might get some refreshment and then return homeward in the shady time of evening

 On this occasion Venn had arrived on Egdon Heath only to cross to the other side he had no further connection with the interests of the Yeobright family and he had a business of his own to attend to

 On account of your rebellious manner to me I was tempted to go further than I should have done and when you still would keep playing the same tantalizing part I went further still and married her

 Why do you want to do that at this particular time when at every previous time that I have proposed it you have refused I cannot explain further than that I should like to see her alone before you go she answered with an impatient move of her head and looking at him with an anxiety more frequently seen upon those of a sanguine temperament than upon such as herself

 I think I would rather you did not accompany me further

 Don t insist further I cannot tell

 Go go Wildeve slowly went up the steps and descended into the darkness on the other side and as he walked he glanced back till the bank blotted out her form from his further view

 As the wax dropped into the fire a long flame arose from the spot and curling its tongue round the figure ate still further into its substance

 Venn soon felt himself relieved from further attendance and went to the door scarcely able yet to realize the strange catastrophe that had befallen the family in which he took so great an interest

 Hence new troubles the confederation of Targowica Russian demands for the repeal of the constitution and unconditional submission to the Empress Catharine II betrayal by Prussia invasion war desertion of the national cause by their own king and his joining the conspirators of Targowica and then the second partition of Poland October implying a further loss of territory and population

 Adalbert Zywny FOOTNOTE This is the usual spelling of the name which as the reader will see further on its possessor wrote Ziwny

 It still further illustrates the relation in which master and pupil stood to each other and by bringing us in close contact with the former makes us better acquainted with his character

 Further Chopin s correspondence which throws much light on his relation to Prince Radziwili contains nothing which would lead one to infer any such indebtedness as Liszt mentions

 Besides Elsner and Zywny who have already been noticed at some length a third musician has to be numbered among friends of the Chopin family namely Joseph Javurek the esteemed composer and professor at the Conservatorium further I must yet make mention of Anton Barcinski professor at the Polytechnic School teacher at Nicholas Chopin s institution and by and by his son in law Dr

 And further let us not undervalue the circumstance that he must have come in close contact with one of the chief actors in this unbloody revolution

 Two anecdotes that relate to this stay at Szafarnia further exemplify what has already been said of Frederick s love of fun and mischief

 Were further proof needed we should find it in the fact that he was selected to display the excellences of the aeolomelodicon when the Emperor Alexander I during his sojourn in Warsaw in FOOTNOTE The Emperor Alexander opened the Diet at Warsaw on May and closed it on June 

 Further we are told that his mother and sisters never tired of recommending him to wrap up carefully in cold and wet weather and that like a good son and brother he followed their advice

 There was for instance the pianist and composer Franz Lessel the favourite pupil of Haydn and further that interesting character Heinrich Gerhard Lentz who born and educated at Cologne went in to Paris played with success his first concerto at the Concert Spirituel published some of his compositions and taught in the best families arrived in London in lived in friendly intercourse with Clementi and Haydn and had compositions of his performed at Solomon s concerts returned to Germany in stayed with Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia till Dussek supplanted him and so wandering about reached Warsaw where he gave lessons founded a pianoforte manufactory became professor of the organ at the Conservatorium married twice and died in 

 The writer in question disapproves of the Italian master s drill method in teaching singing and says that as a composer his power of invention was inferior to his power of construction and further that he was acquainted with the scores of the best musicians of all times and an expert in accompanying on the pianoforte

 Tantae animis coelestibus irae But what was the reason of this indignation Simply this a gentleman who after the second concert came into the coffee room of the hotel where Chopin was staying on being asked by some of the guests how he liked the performance answered laconically the ballet was very pretty and although they put some further questions he would say no more having no doubt noticed a certain person

 As a further proof I may mention the visit which Count Dietrichstein paid me on the stage

 But that is not all the critic says further That if I had fallen into the hands of a pedant or a Rossinist what a stupid expression I could not have become what I am

 The allusions to music and musicians lead us naturally to inquire further after Chopin s musical experiences in Vienna

 Having saved a little money he went for his further improvement to Paris studying especially under Baillot but soon returned to accept an engagement in the Imperial Band

 That this was his usual mode of life at Vienna receives further support from the self satisfaction with which he on one occasion mentions that he had practised from early morning till two o clock in the afternoon

 Therefore without further enlarging on it I shall let Chopin depict the political aspect of Paris in as he saw it and then attempt myself a slight outline sketch of the literary and artistic aspect of the French capital which signifies France

 I may however inform the reader that the subject of romanticism will give rise to further discussion in subsequent chapters

 Of Othello there is likewise an excellent rendering in prospect further also of L Italiana in Algeri

 As a knowledge of Kalkbrenner s artistic personality will help to further our acquaintance with Chopin and as our knowledge of it is for the most part derived from the libels and caricatures of well intentioned critics who in their zeal for a nobler and more glorious art overshoot the mark of truth it will be worth our while to make inquiries regarding it

 With regard to this letter I have further to remark that Hiller who was again in Germany had lately lost his father This is at least the twentieth time that we have made arrangements to meet sometimes at my house sometimes here Footnote At Chopin s lodgings mentioned farther on

 For further information see List of Works at the end of the second volume where my sources of information are mentioned and the divergences of the different original editions as regards time of publication are indicated

 They have both still further developed their execution and Chopin is now one of the very first pianoforte players he produces as novel effects as Paganini does on the violin and performs wonders which one would never have imagined possible

 What more natural therefore than that if the artist s feelings were hurt he should take care that they should not be further tortured by unpleasant remarks in his paper

 Indeed on being further questioned on the subject he modified his original information to this that he showed Chopin unaccompanied by Schumann the way to the lady s house and left him at the door

 Enraged at this refusal Chopin declined to do anything to further his countryman s plans in Paris

 Further Karasowski who does not mention at all the meeting of Chopin and the Wodzinskis at Dresden in says that Chopin went in the middle of July to Marienbad where he knew he would find Maria and her mother and that there he discovered that she whom he loved reciprocated his affection the consequence being an engagement approved of by her relations

 He remarked further that the glasses were singularly small and the wines insipid

 To excuse themselves for what they had said against my book they instanced works of our time by cardinals and other divines of excellent repute which had been blamed for similar faults which in no way affected reputation of the author or of the publication as a whole they requested me to lend the Church the support of my eloquence this was their fair speech and to make longer stay in the place where I should be free from all further intrusion on their part

 It is not my desire at present discourage you from this course for I would have no one act in opposition to his conscience but I wish having regard to the good repute acquired by your family from its enduring concord a family than which none can be dearer to me a family thank God no member of which has ever been guilty of dishonour in regard further to the will of your good father to whom you owe so much and of your uncle I wish you to avoid extreme means avoid harshness and violence be reconciled with your relatives do not act apart but unite

 de la Boetie taking his hand said to him I was on the point of discharging my debt but my kind creditor has given me a little further time

 In truth sir having been overtaken by his fate in the flower of his age and in the full enjoyment of the most vigorous health it had been his design to publish some day works which would have demonstrated to posterity what sort of a man he was and peradventure he was indifferent enough to fame having formed such a plan in his head to proceed no further in it

 the same who so long governed our Guienne a personage whose condition and fortune have in them a great deal of the most notable and most considerable parts of grandeur having been highly incensed by the Limousins and taking their city by assault was not either by the cries of the people or the prayers and tears of the women and children abandoned to slaughter and prostrate at his feet for mercy to be stayed from prosecuting his revenge till penetrating further into the town he at last took notice of three French gentlemen These were Jean de Villemure Hugh de la Roche and Roger de Beaufort

 Nevertheless astonishment and admiration may in less generous minds beget a like effect witness the people of Thebes who having put two of their generals upon trial for their lives for having continued in arms beyond the precise term of their commission very hardly pardoned Pelopidas who bowing under the weight of so dangerous an accusation made no manner of defence for himself nor produced other arguments than prayers and supplications whereas on the contrary Epaminondas falling to recount magniloquently the exploits he had performed in their service and after a haughty and arrogant manner reproaching them with ingratitude and injustice they had not the heart to proceed any further in his trial but broke up the court and departed the whole assembly highly commending the high courage of this personage

 Was it that the height of courage was so natural and familiar to this conqueror that because he could not admire he respected it the less Or was it that he conceived valour to be a virtue so peculiar to himself that his pride could not without envy endure it in another Or was it that the natural impetuosity of his fury was incapable of opposition Certainly had it been capable of moderation it is to be believed that in the sack and desolation of Thebes to see so many valiant men lost and totally destitute of any further defence cruelly massacred before his eyes would have appeased it where there were above six thousand put to the sword of whom not one was seen to fly or heard to cry out for quarter but on the contrary every one running here and there to seek out and to provoke the victorious enemy to help them to an honourable end

 Nay Queen Margaret of Navarre Marguerite de Valois authoress of the Heptameron further adds that it would be a rudeness in a gentleman to go out as we so often do to meet any that is coming to see him let him be of what high condition soever and that it is more respectful and more civil to stay at home to receive him if only upon the account of missing him by the way and that it is enough to receive him at the door and to wait upon him

 Men of understanding do yet to this day condemn the custom of the kings of Persia to give their lieutenants and agents so little rein that upon the least arising difficulties they must fain have recourse to their further commands this delay in so vast an extent of dominion having often very much prejudiced their affairs and Crassus writing to a man whose profession it was best to understand those things and pre acquainting him to what use this mast was designed did he not seem to consult his advice and in a manner invite him to interpose his better judgment CHAPTER XVII OF FEAR Obstupui steteruntque comae et vox faucibus haesit

 And in this sense this good advice of Solon may reasonably be taken but he being a philosopher with which sort of men the favours and disgraces of Fortune stand for nothing either to the making a man happy or unhappy and with whom grandeurs and powers are accidents of a quality almost indifferent I am apt to think that he had some further aim and that his meaning was that the very felicity of life itself which depends upon the tranquillity and contentment of a well descended spirit and the resolution and assurance of a well ordered soul ought never to be attributed to any man till he has first been seen to play the last and doubtless the hardest act of his part

 Let them say what they will to premeditate is doubtless a very great advantage and besides is it nothing to go so far at least without disturbance or alteration Moreover Nature herself assists and encourages us if the death be sudden and violent we have not leisure to fear if otherwise I perceive that as I engage further in my disease I naturally enter into a certain loathing and disdain of life

 Which makes me hope that the further I remove from the first and the nearer I approach to the latter I shall the more easily exchange the one for the other

 Augustine urges of having seen a man who could command his rear to discharge as often together as he pleased Vives his commentator yet further fortifies with another example in his time of one that could break wind in tune but these cases do not suppose any more pure obedience in that part for is anything commonly more tumultuary or indiscreet To which let me add that I myself knew one so rude and ungoverned as for forty years together made his master vent with one continued and unintermitted outbursting and tis like will do so till he die of it

 Taking upon me once to justify something in use amongst us and that was received with absolute authority for a great many leagues round about us and not content as men commonly do to establish it only by force of law and example but inquiring still further into its origin I found the foundation so weak that I who made it my business to confirm others was very near being dissatisfied myself

 and voluntarily delivered himself up to their cruelty by that means to free both himself and them from further trouble

 Let him be taught to be curious in the election and choice of his reasons to abominate impertinence and consequently to affect brevity but above all let him be lessoned to acquiesce and submit to truth so soon as ever he shall discover it whether in his opponent s argument or upon better consideration of his own for he shall never be preferred to the chair for a mere clatter of words and syllogisms and is no further engaged to any argument whatever than as he shall in his own judgment approve it nor yet is arguing a trade where the liberty of recantation and getting off upon better thoughts are to be sold for ready money Neque ut omnia qux praescripta et imperata sint defendat necessitate ulla cogitur

 Going one day to Orleans I met in that plain on this side Clery two pedants who were travelling towards Bordeaux about fifty paces distant from one another and a good way further behind them I discovered a troop of horse with a gentleman at the head of them who was the late Monsieur le Comte de la Rochefoucauld

 Such as only meddle with things subject to the conduct of human capacity are excusable in doing the best they can but those other fellows that come to delude us with assurances of an extraordinary faculty beyond our understanding ought they not to be punished when they do not make good the effect of their promise and for the temerity of their imposture They have continual war with the nations that live further within the mainland beyond their mountains to which they go naked and without other arms than their bows and wooden swords fashioned at one end like the head of our javelins

 The Hungarians a very warlike people never pretend further than to reduce the enemy to their discretion for having forced this confession from them they let them go without injury or ransom excepting at the most to make them engage their word never to bear arms against them again

 Demanding of him further how many men he had to follow him he showed me a space of ground to signify as many as could march in such a compass which might be four or five thousand men and putting the question to him whether or no his authority expired with the war he told me this remained that when he went to visit the villages of his dependence they planed him paths through the thick of their woods by which he might pass at his ease

 In husbandry study hunting and all other exercises men are to proceed to the utmost limits of pleasure but must take heed of engaging further where trouble begins to mix with it

 To which we may add that saying of Cyrus that no man was fit to rule but he who in his own worth was of greater value than those he was to govern but King Hiero in Xenophon says further that in the fruition even of pleasure itself they are in a worse condition than private men forasmuch as the opportunities and facility they have of commanding those things at will takes off from the delight that ordinary folks enjoy Pinguis amor nimiumque patens in taedia nobis Vertitur et stomacho dulcis ut esca nocet

 But let us return to Hiero who further complains of the inconveniences he found in his royalty in that he could not look abroad and travel the world at liberty being as it were a prisoner in the bounds and limits of his own dominion and that in all his actions he was evermore surrounded with an importunate crowd

 Caesar calls all the lords of France having free franchise within their own demesnes roitelets or petty kings and in truth the name of sire excepted they go pretty far towards kingship for do but look into the provinces remote from court as Brittany for example take notice of the train the vassals the officers the employments service ceremony and state of a lord who lives retired from court in his own house amongst his own tenants and servants and observe withal the flight of his imagination there is nothing more royal he hears talk of his master once a year as of a king of Persia without taking any further recognition of him than by some remote kindred his secretary keeps in some register

 We may here further compare him with Alexander in the great and dangerous storm that threatened him by the sedition of the tribune Metellus who attempting to publish a decree for the calling in of Pompey with his army into the city at the time of Catiline s conspiracy was only and that stoutly opposed by Cato so that very sharp language and bitter menaces passed betwixt them in the senate about that affair but it was the next day in the forenoon that the controversy was to be decided where Metellus besides the favour of the people and of Caesar at that time of Pompey s faction was to appear accompanied with a rabble of slaves and gladiators and Cato only fortified with his own courage and constancy so that his relations domestics and many virtuous people of his friends were in great apprehensions for him and to that degree that some there were who passed over the whole night without sleep eating or drinking for the danger they saw him running into his wife and sisters did nothing but weep and torment themselves in his house whereas he on the contrary comforted every one and after having supped after his usual manner went to bed and slept profoundly till morning when one of his fellow tribunes roused him to go to the encounter

 We need look no further for examples than our own royal family where every partition creates a new surname whilst in the meantime the original of the family is totally lost

 never concerned himself further than the letters of his name of which he has altered the whole contexture to build up by anagram the Count d Alsinois whom he has handsomely endowed with the glory of his poetry and painting

 Let us go further into this matter since here we are

 CHAPTER L OF DEMOCRITUS AND HERACLITUS The judgment is an utensil proper for all subjects and will have an oar in everything which is the reason that in these Essays I take hold of all occasions where though it happen to be a subject I do not very well understand I try however sounding it at a distance and finding it too deep for my stature I keep me on the shore and this knowledge that a man can proceed no further is one effect of its virtue yes one of those of which it is most proud

 Are not they then pleasant men who think they have rendered this fit for the people s handling by translating it into the vulgar tongue Does the understanding of all therein contained only stick at words Shall I venture to say further that by coming so near to understand a little they are much wider of the whole scope than before

 And I do further believe that the liberty every one has taken to disperse the sacred writ into so many idioms carries with it a great deal more of danger than utility

 For seeing that men do not usually proceed so far it is a sign that we are pretty well advanced and since we have exceeded the ordinary bounds which is the just measure of life we ought not to expect to go much further having escaped so many precipices of death whereinto we have seen so many other men fall we should acknowledge that so extraordinary a fortune as that which has hitherto rescued us from those eminent perils and kept us alive beyond the ordinary term of living is not like to continue long

 Since ambition can teach man valour temperance and liberality and even justice too seeing that avarice can inspire the courage of a shop boy bred and nursed up in obscurity and ease with the assurance to expose himself so far from the fireside to the mercy of the waves and angry Neptune in a frail boat that she further teaches discretion and prudence and that even Venus can inflate boys under the discipline of the rod with boldness and resolution and infuse masculine courage into the heart of tender virgins in their mothers arms Hac duce custodes furtim transgressa jacentes Ad juvenem tenebris sola puella venit She leading the maiden furtively passing by the recumbent guards goes alone in the darkness to the youth

 And I have been further told by a lady whom I highly honour and esteem that near Bordeaux and about Castres where she lives a country woman a widow of chaste repute perceiving in herself the first symptoms of breeding innocently told her neighbours that if she had a husband she should think herself with child but the causes of suspicion every day more and more increasing and at last growing up to a manifest proof the poor woman was reduced to the necessity of causing it to be proclaimed in her parish church that whoever had done that deed and would frankly confess it she did not only promise to forgive but moreover to marry him if he liked the motion whereupon a young fellow that served her in the quality of a labourer encouraged by this proclamation declared that he had one holiday found her having taken too much of the bottle so fast asleep by the chimney and in so indecent a posture that he could conveniently do his business without waking her and they yet live together man and wife

 There are fantastic and senseless humours that have prompted not only individual men but whole nations to destroy themselves of which I have elsewhere given some examples and we further read of the Milesian virgins that by a frantic compact they hanged themselves one after another till the magistrate took order in it enacting that the bodies of such as should be found so hanged should be drawn by the same halter stark naked through the city

 It is most certain that in times past the recompense of this order had not only a regard to valour but had a further prospect it never was the reward of a valiant soldier but of a great captain the science of obeying was not reputed worthy of so honourable a guerdon

 He has lived long enough if he be wise to have a mind to strip himself to go to bed not to his very shirt I confess but to that and a good warm dressing gown the remaining pomps of which he has no further use he ought voluntarily to surrender to those to whom by the order of nature they belong

 Does he turn away a servant he packs up his bundle and is gone but tis no further than just out of his sight the steps of old age are so slow the senses so troubled that he will live and do his old office in the same house a year together without being perceived

 Both your goods and you belong to your families as well those past as those to come but further both your family and goods much more appertain to the public

 This same consideration carries me further I observe that the best of the ancient poets have avoided affectation and the hunting after not only fantastic Spanish and Petrarchic elevations but even the softer and more gentle touches which are the ornament of all succeeding poesy

 I am very sorry we have not a dozen Laertii Diogenes Laertius who wrote the Lives of the Philosophers or that he was not further extended for I am equally curious to know the lives and fortunes of these great instructors of the world as to know the diversities of their doctrines and opinions

 An Italian lord once said this in my presence to the disadvantage of his own nation that the subtlety of the Italians and the vivacity of their conceptions were so great and they foresaw the dangers and accidents that might befall them so far off that it was not to be thought strange if they were often in war observed to provide for their safety even before they had discovered the peril that we French and the Spaniards who were not so cunning went on further and that we must be made to see and feel the danger before we would take the alarm but that even then we could not stick to it

 Nor do I cherish error further

 or Nor carry wrong further

 which is a very pretty book of its kind nor for a thing of extreme difficulty to pass whole nights where a man has all the convenience and liberty he can desire with a long coveted mistress and yet be true to the pledge first given to satisfy himself with kisses and suchlike endearments without pressing any further

 If this were true men need not be virtuous but in public and we should be no further concerned to keep the operations of the soul which is the true seat of virtue regular and in order than as they are to arrive at the knowledge of others

 She has not taught us to follow and embrace virtue and prudence but she has imprinted in us their derivation and etymology we know how to decline Virtue if we know not how to love it if we do not know what prudence is really and in effect and by experience we have it however by jargon and heart we are not content to know the extraction kindred and alliances of our neighbours we desire moreover to have them our friends and to establish a correspondence and intelligence with them but this education of ours has taught us definitions divisions and partitions of virtue as so many surnames and branches of a genealogy without any further care of establishing any familiarity or intimacy betwixt her and us

 Tis the only way by which we communicate our thoughts and wills tis the interpreter of the soul and if it deceive us we no longer know nor have further tie upon one another if that deceive us it breaks all our correspondence and dissolves all the ties of government

 He was indeed sharp against us but yet no cruel enemy for our own people tell this story of him that one day walking about the city of Chalcedon Maris bishop of the place was so bold as to tell him that he was impious and an enemy to Christ at which they say he was no further moved than to reply Go poor wretch and lament the loss of thy eyes to which the bishop replied again I thank Jesus Christ for taking away my sight that I may not see thy impudent visage affecting in that they say a philosophical patience

 The Emperor Julian said yet further that a philosopher and a brave man ought not so much as to breathe that is to say not to allow any more to bodily necessities than what we cannot refuse keeping the soul and body still intent and busy about honourable great and virtuous things

 Cato believing that it was something the conspirators gave him notice of required him to deliver into his hand which Caesar was constrained to do to avoid further suspicion

 He still less feared his enemies than he hated them some conspiracies and cabals that were made against his life being discovered to him he satisfied himself in publishing by proclamation that they were known to him without further prosecuting the conspirators

 They must here of necessity confess that if reason be not fortune at least is on my side and with physicians fortune goes a great deal further than reason

 In my country of Gascony they look upon it as a drollery to see me in print the further off I am read from my own home the better I am esteemed

 There are secret and not to be foreseen parts in matters we have in hand especially in the nature of men mute conditions that make no show unknown sometimes even to the possessors themselves that spring and start up by incidental occasions if my prudence could not penetrate into nor foresee them I blame it not tis commissioned no further than its own limits if the event be too hard for me and take the side I have refused there is no remedy I do not blame myself I accuse my fortune and not my work this cannot be called repentance

 By this intelligence you obtain credit to proceed further and by a facile and insensible gradation fall into discourses more solid and proper for their cure

 In consideration of which I will further say this for I desire to please every one though it will be hard to do Esse unum hominem accommodatum ad tantam morum ac sermonum et voluntatum varietatem For a man to conform to such a variety of manners discourses and will

 One catches at a word and a simile another is no longer sensible of what is said in opposition to him and thinks only of going on at his own rate not of answering you another finding himself too weak to make good his rest fears all refuses all at the very beginning confounds the subject or in the very height of the dispute stops short and is silent by a peevish ignorance affecting a proud contempt or a foolishly modest avoidance of further debate provided this man strikes he cares not how much he lays himself open the other counts his words and weighs them for reasons another only brawls and uses the advantage of his lungs

 What if the plainest reasons are the best seated the meanest lowest and most beaten more adapted to affairs To maintain the authority of the counsels of kings it needs not that profane persons should participate of them or see further into them than the outmost barrier he who will husband its reputation must be reverenced upon credit and taken altogether

 And wherever I have taken in hand to strengthen some old foundations of walls and to repair some ruinous buildings in earnest I have done it more out of respect to his design than my own satisfaction and am angry at myself that I have not proceeded further to finish the beginnings he left in his house and so much the more because I am very likely to be the last possessor of my race and to give the last hand to it

 First because I conceive that a man having once parted with his labours to the world he has no further right to them let him do better if he can in some new undertaking but not adulterate what he has already sold

 I am not only better pleased in doing him service than if he conferred a benefit upon me but moreover had rather he should do himself good than me and he most obliges me when he does so and if absence be either more pleasant or convenient for him tis also more acceptable to me than his presence neither is it properly absence when we can write to one another I have sometimes made good use of our separation from one another we better filled and further extended the possession of life in being parted

 For which reason I am not afraid to insert in it several private articles which will spend their use amongst the men that are now living and that concern the particular knowledge of some who will see further into them than every common reader

 Since every one s imagination renders it more or less terrible and since every one has some choice amongst the several forms of dying let us try a little further to find some one that is wholly clear from all offence

 It is not so much that they will go as it is that they cannot stand still like a rolling stone that cannot stop till it can go no further

 This little well doing has neither body nor life it vanishes in the first mouth and goes no further than from one street to another

 So has it happened in the school of philosophy the pride of those who attributed the capacity of all things to the human mind created in others out of despite and emulation this opinion that it is capable of nothing the one maintain the same extreme in ignorance that the others do in knowledge to make it undeniably manifest that man is immoderate throughout and can never stop but of necessity and the want of ability to proceed further

 Do but observe how many slight and frivolous and if nearly examined incorporeal arguments the closest and wisest authors scatter about one good one they are but verbal quirks and fallacies to amuse and gull us but forasmuch as it may be with some profit I will sift them no further many of that sort are here and there dispersed up and down this book either borrowed or by imitation

 But according to my method of advising just and profitable things I say that you will do your consciences more right to set me at liberty unless you see further into my cause than I do and judging according to my past actions both public and private according to my intentions and according to the profit that so many of our citizens both young and old daily extract from my conversation and the fruit that you all reap from me you cannot more duly acquit yourselves towards my merit than in ordering that my poverty considered I should be maintained at the Prytanaeum at the public expense a thing that I have often known you with less reason grant to others

 No generous mind can stop in itself it will still tend further and beyond its power it has sallies beyond its effects if it do not advance and press forward and retire and rush and wheel about tis but half alive its pursuits are without bound or method its aliment is admiration the chase ambiguity which Apollo sufficiently declared in always speaking to us in a double obscure and oblique sense not feeding but amusing and puzzling us

 A stone is a body but if a man should further urge And what is a body Substance And what is substance and so on he would drive the respondent to the end of his Calepin

 The wise speak and deliver their fancies more specifically and piece by piece I who see no further into things than as use informs me present mine generally without rule and experimentally I pronounce my opinion by disjointed articles as a thing that cannot be spoken at once and in gross relation and conformity are not to be found in such low and common souls as ours

 For such a purpose I would have a man who is content with his own fortune Quod sit esse velit nihilque malit Who is pleased with what he is and desires nothing further

 Further I was going into a wilderness where though I should resume touch with the Treasury there were no telegraph offices

 What did you and Daniel Dravot do when the camels could go no further because of the rough roads that led into Kafiristan What did which do There was a party called Peachey Taliaferro Carnehan that was with Dravot

 Tulliver Further Entangles the Skein of Life Book II School Time 

 Maggie thinking it was no use to contend further began too and ate up her half puff with considerable relish as well as rapidity

 There was no reply but a further shake of the head as Mrs

 But this morning he was in a mood more becoming a man of business and in the course of his ride along the Basset lanes with their deep ruts lying so far away from a market town that the labor of drawing produce and manure was enough to take away the best part of the profits on such poor land as that parish was made of he got up a due amount of irritation against Moss as a man without capital who if murrain and blight were abroad was sure to have his share of them and who the more you tried to help him out of the mud would sink the further in

 I ll open the shutter a bit further

 The appearance of the little girls suggested to uncle Pullet the further solace of small sweet cakes of which he also kept a stock under lock and key for his own private eating on wet days but the three children had no sooner got the tempting delicacy between their fingers than aunt Pullet desired them to abstain from eating it till the tray and the plates came since with those crisp cakes they would make the floor all over crumbs

 After a little further discussion as to whether it would not be better for Mrs

 Glegg s suggestion that she would do well to let her five hundred lie still until a good investment turned up and further his parenthetic hint at his handsome provision for her in case of his death

 Tulliver Further Entangles the Skein of Life Owing to this new adjustment of Mrs

 Tulliver s prompt procedure entailed on him further promptitude in finding the convenient person who was desirous of lending five hundred pounds on bond

 But the immediate step to future success was to bring on Tom Tulliver during this first half year for by a singular coincidence there had been some negotiation concerning another pupil from the same neighborhood and it might further a decision in Mr

 Tom as I said had never been so much like a girl in his life before and at that epoch of irregular verbs his spirit was further depressed by a new means of mental development which had been thought of for him out of school hours

 With some further stammering and repetition Tom got through the next few lines

 It was happy for them if some ambitious draper of their acquaintance had not brought up his son to the Church and if that young gentleman at the age of four and twenty had not closed his college dissipations by an imprudent marriage otherwise these innocent fathers desirous of doing the best for their offspring could only escape the draper s son by happening to be on the foundation of a grammar school as yet unvisited by commissioners where two or three boys could have all to themselves the advantages of a large and lofty building together with a head master toothless dim eyed and deaf whose erudite indistinctness and inattention were engrossed by them at the rate of three hundred pounds a head a ripe scholar doubtless when first appointed but all ripeness beneath the sun has a further stage less esteemed in the market

 People who live at a distance are naturally less faulty than those immediately under our own eyes and it seems superfluous when we consider the remote geographical position of the Ethiopians and how very little the Greeks had to do with them to inquire further why Homer calls them blameless

 She was not scrubbing indiscriminately for there would be further dirt of the same atrocious kind made by people who had still to fetch away their purchases but she was bent on bringing the parlor where that pipe smoking pig the bailiff had sat to such an appearance of scant comfort as could be given to it by cleanliness and the few articles of furniture bought in for the family

 Deane would say nothing decided about the matter the fact that Wakem held the mortgage on the land might put it into his head to bid for the whole estate and further to outbid the cautious firm of Guest Co

 The roach necessarily abhors the mode in which the pike gets his living and the pike is likely to think nothing further even of the most indignant roach than that he is excellent good eating it could only be when the roach choked him that the pike could entertain a strong personal animosity

 Maggie obeyed wondering but her father gave no further orders and only sat listening for Tom s footfall on the gravel apparently irritated by the wind which had risen and was roaring so as to drown all other sounds

 Glegg who had contracted a cautious liking for Tom ever since his spirited and sensible behavior when the execution was in the house was now warming into a resolution to further his prospects actively some time when an opportunity offered of doing so in a prudent manner without ultimate loss but Mrs

 Glegg rising to get her knitting with the sense that any further remark after this would be bathos

 As soon as I came to the blond haired young lady reading in the park I shut it up and determined to read no further

 But he shall know if you attempt to use deceit toward me any further

 Then seeing that Wakem had ridden off and that no further violence was possible she slackened her hold and burst into hysteric sobs while poor Mrs

 Somebody has said it s a fine thing to make two ears of corn grow where only one grew before but sir it s a fine thing too to further the exchange of commodities and bring the grains of corn to the mouths that are hungry

 It was not a suggestive remark and as the speaker did not follow it up by further development it naturally left the conversation at a standstill

 I don t know whether you consider it gentlemanly and delicate conduct to place me in a position that forced me to come out with you or whether you wished to insult me still further by thrusting an interview upon me in this way

 At last she said with a passionate assertion of her conviction as much against herself as against him That seems right at first but when I look further I m sure it is not right

 But further questions would have been too intrusive even if he could have framed them suitably and he was obliged to carry baby away again to an expectant mother

 Chapter VII contains further suggestions in regard to this problem

 SOIL ANTECEDENTS There was a further reason for mentioning that strip of onion ground

 In most soils it will do this work as well if not better than the spade and has the further good quality of being serviceable as a fork too thus combining two tools in one

 Further information may be had from the firms which sell raw materials or from your Experiment Station

 I shall therefore not go further into the first classification of soils mentioned

 It contains the proper proportions of both sand and clay and further has been put into the best of mechanical condition by good tilth

 Or better still for the few earliest frames have double glass sash the dead air space making further protection unnecessary

 Proceed so to the end of the row being careful to keep your toes from undoing your good work behind you and then finish the job by walking back over the row still further firming in each plant by pressing down the soil at either side of the stem simultaneously with the balls of the feet

 You will then have time to do it properly and will need to give it no further thought for a year

 For further treatment see Chapter XIV

 The quality is infinitely superior to the wild dandelion and may be still further improved by blanching

 Winter Baldwin Rhode Island Greening Northwestern Greening Jonathan Northern Spy Yellow Swaar Delicious Wagener King Esopus Spitzenberg Yellow Bellflower Winter Banana Seek no further Talman Sweet Roxbury Russett King David Stayman s Winesap Wolf River

 And then there is one further reason psychological perhaps but none the less important you will watch these little trees which are largely the result of your own labor and care when set in their permanent positions much more carefully than you would those direct from the nursery

 If the land is in clover sod it will have the ideal preparation especially if you can grow a patch of potatoes or corn on it one year while your trees are getting further growth

 Further information in regard to pruning and the different needs of the various fruits in regard to this important matter will be given in the next chapter

 If the tree is once started right further pruning will give little trouble

 A further purpose of pruning is to effect indirectly a thinning of the fruit so that what is grown will be larger and more valuable and also that the trees may not become exhausted by a few exceptionally heavy crops

 This is due partly at least to the fact that many methods are advocated by successful growers and that the beginner is not likely to pick out one and stick to it and further that he is led to pay more attention to how many layers he will have and at what distance he will set the plants than to proper selection and preparation of soil and other vital matters

 Personally the further I have gone into the growing of things and that has now become my business as well as my pleasure the more absorbingly interesting I find it

 We shall have no further occasion to speak of M

 Before proceeding further let us come to an understanding as to the words human face which we have just applied to Javert

 After the expiration of a few moments do what he would he resumed the gloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened saying that which he would have preferred to ignore and listened to that which he would have preferred not to hear yielding to that mysterious power which said to him Think as it said to another condemned man two thousand years ago March on Before proceeding further and in order to make ourselves fully understood let us insist upon one necessary observation

 He proceeded a few paces further then he stopped short

 He was no further advanced than at the beginning

 If he went no further that was no fault of his

 It did not concern him further

 It was a frightful old trap it rests flat on the axle it is an actual fact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs the rain came into it the wheels were rusted and eaten with moisture it would not go much further than the tilbury a regular ramshackle old stage wagon the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trusted himself to it etc

 Ah returned the road mender so you don t know that the road is under repair You will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on there is no way to proceed further

 The appearance of this man had sufficed to suffuse with light that matter which had been so obscure but a moment previously without any further explanation the whole crowd as by a sort of electric revelation understood instantly and at a single glance the simple and magnificent history of a man who was delivering himself up so that another man might not be condemned in his stead

 I do not wish to disturb the court further resumed Jean Valjean

 He remained thus mute absorbed evidently with no further thought of anything connected with this life

 A quarter of a league further on he arrived at the bottom of a little valley where there is water which passes beneath an arch made through the embankment of the road

 It was in this garden further down than the orchard that six light infantry men of the st having made their way thither and being unable to escape hunted down and caught like bears in their dens accepted the combat with two Hanoverian companies one of which was armed with carbines

 The cuirassiers relatively few in number and still further diminished by the catastrophe of the ravine had almost the whole English army against them but they multiplied themselves so that each man of them was equal to ten

 CHAPTER II IN WHICH THE READER WILL PERUSE TWO VERSES WHICH ARE OF THE DEVIL S COMPOSITION POSSIBLY Before proceeding further it will be to the purpose to narrate in some detail a singular occurrence which took place at about the same epoch in Montfermeil and which is not lacking in coincidence with certain conjectures of the indictment

 The further she went the denser the darkness became

 It had been hard to advance further than the last stall it became impossible to proceed further than the last house

 She took breath for an instant then lifted the handle of the bucket again and resumed her march proceeding a little further this time but again she was obliged to pause

 We shall see further on that this man had in fact hired a chamber in that isolated quarter

 On this occasion wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further

 Thenardier replied coldly How you do go on They exchanged no further words and a few moments later their candle was extinguished

 At the further extremity through a glass door he saw two small very white beds

 This time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that Thenardier decided that it was useless to proceed further

 However he was thought to be dead and this still further increased the obscurity which had gathered about him

 FOR A BLACK HUNT A MUTE PACK CHAPTER I THE ZIGZAGS OF STRATEGY An observation here becomes necessary in view of the pages which the reader is about to peruse and of others which will be met with further on

 CHAPTER III TO WIT THE PLAN OF PARIS IN Three hundred paces further on he arrived at a point where the street forked

 This wall however did not absolutely prevent further progress it was a wall which bordered a transverse street in which the one he had taken ended

 On that side the lane was open and about two hundred paces further on ran into a street of which it was the affluent

 This garden was oblong in shape with an alley of large poplars at the further end tolerably tall forest trees in the corners and an unshaded space in the centre where could be seen a very large solitary tree then several fruit trees gnarled and bristling like bushes beds of vegetables a melon patch whose glass frames sparkled in the moonlight and an old well

 You need fear nothing further

 Ah said Fauchelevent so there is a child He added not a word further and followed Jean Valjean as a dog follows his master

 The impossibility of approaching too close his costume of an emigre preceptor the declaration of Thenardier which made a grandfather of him and finally the belief in his death in prison added still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in Javert s mind

 The fact is that had he penetrated a little further in the Cul de Sac Genrot he would probably have done so and have been lost

 If one doubled this cape one arrived a few paces further on in front of a door which was all the more mysterious because it was not fastened

 The first minutes passed when one s eyes began to grow used to this cellar like half twilight one tried to pass the grating but got no further than six inches beyond it

 not to go any further back the king rightly desired to create a fleet

 Twenty leagues further on his audacity having increased he attacked with his pinnace and captured a large English transport which was carrying troops to Sicily and which was so loaded down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea

 And he said to his daughter in a low tone and with a wink Some love affair CHAPTER VI THE CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING MET A WARDEN Where it was that Marius went will be disclosed a little further on

 Whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further

 She had never been able to get further than her cat

 On the following days he returned as was his wont to the Luxembourg as usual he found there the father and daughter but he paid no further attention to them

 He even got to within three intervals of trees but there he felt an indescribable impossibility of proceeding further and he hesitated

 As he went further from the bench and the young girl and while his back was turned to her he fancied that she was gazing after him and that made him stumble

 He went to the Luxembourg again but he did not proceed further than his bench midway of the alley

 Below all these mines which we have just mentioned below all these galleries below this whole immense subterranean venous system of progress and utopia much further on in the earth much lower than Marat lower than Babeuf lower much lower and without any connection with the upper levels there lies the last mine

 After perusing these four letters Marius did not find himself much further advanced than before

 Oh the unfortunate wretches How pale they are How cold they are It seems as though they dwelt in a planet much further from the sun than ours

 He lowered his voice still further and said Put this in the fire

 Thenardier s well grounded observation still further obscured for Marius the dense mystery which enveloped that grave and singular person on whom Courfeyrac had bestowed the sobriquet of Monsieur Leblanc

 This trifle once out of your pocket I guarantee you that that s the end of the matter and that you have no further demands to fear

 What excited the carpenter and caused him to show this thing to his neighbors was the fact that a few paces further on he picked up another paper torn like the first and still more significant of which we reproduce a facsimile because of the historical interest attaching to these strange documents Q C D E Learn this list by heart

 The police learned nothing further about it

 The woman Magnon who was mentioned a few pages further back was the same one who had succeeded in making old Gillenormand support the two children which she had had

 But this model itself a marvellous sketch the grandiose skeleton of an idea of Napoleon s which successive gusts of wind have carried away and thrown on each occasion still further from us had become historical and had acquired a certain definiteness which contrasted with its provisional aspect

 The lad asked for no further enlightenment

 Marius since that time had not gone further than to touch Cosette s hand or her kerchief or a lock of her hair with his lips

 In the middle of another conversation he chanced to exclaim Oh One day at the Luxembourg I had a good mind to finish breaking up a veteran But he stopped short and went no further

 They had confided in each other as far as possible but this had not extended much further than their names

 I will question you no further since you do not wish it

 Once as he sat with his knees pressed together and his eyes almost closed in a despondent attitude his daughter ventured to say to him Father are you as angry with him as ever She paused not daring to proceed further

 A little further on on catching sight of a group of comfortable looking persons who seemed to be landed proprietors he shrugged his shoulders and spit out at random before him this mouthful of philosophical bile as they passed How fat those moneyed men are They re drunk They just wallow in good dinners

 A little further on they are found still better expressed by the Rue Pirouette which ran into the Rue Mondetour

 At the end of this street which was very short he found further passage barred in the direction of the Halles by a tall row of houses and he would have thought himself in a blind alley had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through which he could make his escape

 No more light was to be hoped for henceforth except the lightning of guns no further encounter except the abrupt and rapid apparition of death

 But how excusable he feels it even while holding out against it How he venerates it even while resisting it This is one of those rare moments when while doing that which it is one s duty to do one feels something which disconcerts one and which would dissuade one from proceeding further one persists it is necessary but conscience though satisfied is sad and the accomplishment of duty is complicated with a pain at the heart

 Moreover it had been a long time since he had seen him and this still further augmented the impossibility for Marius timid and reserved nature

 By way of further security and by means of a rope fastened to his neck they added to the system of ligatures which rendered every attempt at escape impossible that sort of bond which is called in prisons a martingale which starting at the neck forks on the stomach and meets the hands after passing between the legs

 Since the departure of the five they had increased its height still further

 There are beings who demand nothing further mortals who having the azure of heaven say It is enough dreamers absorbed in the wonderful dipping into the idolatry of nature indifferent to good and evil contemplators of cosmos and radiantly forgetful of man who do not understand how people can occupy themselves with the hunger of these and the thirst of those with the nudity of the poor in winter with the lymphatic curvature of the little spinal column with the pallet the attic the dungeon and the rags of shivering young girls when they can dream beneath the trees peaceful and terrible spirits they and pitilessly satisfied

 The great boots of the sewermen never ventured further than certain well known points

 Hardly had Bruneseau crossed the first articulations of that subterranean network when eight laborers out of the twenty refused to go any further

 Every time that he encountered a branch he felt of its angles and if he found that the opening which presented itself was smaller than the passage in which he was he did not enter but continued his route rightly judging that every narrower way must needs terminate in a blind alley and could only lead him further from his goal that is to say the outlet

 What more simple in fact To cry out at the first post that they passed Here is a fugitive from justice who has broken his ban to summon the gendarmes and say to them This man is yours then to go off leaving that condemned man there to ignore the rest and not to meddle further in the matter

 He sought to dull his senses rather than to gain further light

 Little by little this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of the Rue des Filles du Calvaire he halted half way in the Rue Saint Louis sometimes a little further off sometimes a little nearer

 He got as far as the Rue Pavee shook his head and turned back then he went no further than the Rue des Trois Pavillons then he did not overstep the Blancs Manteaux

 He had specialties and categories on each nail of his shop hung a social status threadbare and worn here the suit of a magistrate there the outfit of a Cure beyond the outfit of a banker in one corner the costume of a retired military man elsewhere the habiliments of a man of letters and further on the dress of a statesman

 I know enough about you to send you to the galleys and even further if I choose

 He reflected further

 So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present and seek further

 Then he betook himself to his seat rested his elbows on his desk and his jaws in his hands and stared at the wall with the stony stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go

 It was not inhabited it lay far over toward the further shore abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest

 We will leave them to smoke and chatter and brag since we have no further use for them at present

 After some further questioning counsel for the prosecution said Take the witness

 Huck accompanied them no further

 But why don t you want it known Huck would not explain further than to say that he already knew too much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything against him for the whole world he would be killed for knowing it sure

 This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing the petition to the governor for Injun Joe s pardon

 Sowerberry the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a side door while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human life to come further down

 CHAPTER IX CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS It was late next morning when Oliver awoke from a sound long sleep

 If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament I should at once find it in the fact also recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative of their quitting the pursuit when the general attention was fixed upon Oliver and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut

 CHAPTER XIV COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER S STAY AT MR

 At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street nearly full of old clothes shops the dog running forward as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping on guard stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted the house was in a ruinous condition and on the door was nailed a board intimating that it was to let which looked as if it had hung there for many years

 The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room just as the Jew and the two boys returned dragging Oliver among them

 The Jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss Nancy s rage and shrinking involuntarily back a few paces cast a glance half imploring and half cowardly at Sikes as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue

 Grimwig forbore to vex him further

 William Sikes and further that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought fit and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or evil that might be necessary to visit him it being understood that to render the compact in this respect binding any representations made by Mr

 The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver s not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject but the truth is that although Oliver felt very anxious he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of Fagin s looks and his own speculations to make any further inquiries just then

 For a long time Oliver lay awake thinking it not impossible that Nancy might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice but the girl sat brooding over the fire without moving save now and then to trim the light

 Sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes that Oliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any further

 Oliver and Sikes got in without any further ceremony and the man to whom he belonged having lingered for a minute or two to bear him up and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal mounted also

 He replied to their salutations in the same way but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached the further end of the alley when he stopped to address a salesman of small stature who had squeezed as much of his person into a child s chair as the chair would hold and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door

 Bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs

 Claypole without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs to reach the ground gazed at the beadle in drunken terror

 An ass said the doctor again after a further silence of some minutes

 Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search they did not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further prosecution hopeless and even then they gave it up with reluctance

 Bumble who had eyed the building with very rueful looks was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then when he was prevented by the appearance of Monks w ho opened a small door near which they stood and beckoned them inwards

 If he were not discharged it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well for our purposes be deaf dumb blind and an idiot

 As Noah s red nose grew redder with anger and as he crossed the road while speaking as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution the woman rose without any further remark and trudged onward by his side

 She struggled and implored by turns until twelve o clock had struck and then wearied and exhausted ceased to contest the point any further

 Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then and in a few minutes the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour

 Whether it is a wine stain fruit stain beer stain water stain paint stain pitch stain mud stain or blood stain The man got no further for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table and tearing the hat from him burst out of the house

 There was a short silence after which Toby Crackit seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil may care swagger turned to Chitling and said When was Fagin took then Just at dinner time two o clock this afternoon

 You know that Sikes is dead that Monks has confessed that there is no hope of any further gain

 Further investigations and discoveries will I trust confirm the correctness of the conclusions at which I have arrived

 This would seem to indicate that the plant was a native of America and this is confirmed by the superiority of American cotton and the further fact that the plants taken from America to India constantly degenerate while those taken from India to America as constantly improve

 Having demonstrated as we think successfully that there is no improbability in the statement of Plato that a large island almost a continent existed in the past in the Atlantic Ocean nay more that it is a geological certainty that it did exist and having further shown that it is not improbable but very possible that it may have sunk beneath the sea in the manner described by Plato we come now to the next question Is the memory of this gigantic catastrophe preserved among the traditions of mankind We think there can be no doubt that an affirmative answer must be given to this question

 The voice further said that they were to return to Babylon and conformably to the decrees of fate disinter the writings buried at Sippara in order to transmit them to men

 The Mandans celebrated their great religious festival above described in the season when the willow is first in leaf and a dove is mixed up in the ceremonies and they further relate a legend that the world was once a great tortoise borne on the waters and covered with earth and that when one day in digging the soil a tribe of white men who had made holes in the earth to a great depth digging for badgers at length pierced the shell of the tortoise it sank and the water covering it drowned all men with the exception of one who saved himself in a boat and when the earth re emerged sent out a dove who returned with a branch of willow in its beak

 He further shows satisfactorily that the majority of the names of the twenty days employed by the Aztecs are those of a zodiac used since the most remote antiquity among the peoples of Eastern Asia

 The Samaritan makes it the old Hebrew the Moab stone inscription gives it the later Ph nicians simplified the archaic form still further until it became then it passed into the archaic Greek form is the later Greeks made from which it passed into the present form N

 It is probable that a full study of the Central American monuments may throw stronger light upon the connection between the Maya and the European alphabets and that further discoveries of inscriptions in Europe may approximate the alphabets of the New and Old World still more closely by supplying intermediate forms

 As regards bronze there is first the discovery of copper and the way of getting it from its ore then the discovery of tin and the way to get it from its ore and then the further discovery that by an admixture of tin with copper in proper proportions an alloy with the qualities of a hard metal can be produced

 If we needed any further proof that the empire of the Titans was the empire of Atlantis we would find it in the names of the Titans among these were Oceanus Saturn or Chronos and Atlas they were all the sons of Uranos

 We are further told chap

 Their palate was still further regaled by confections and pastry for which their maize flower and sugar furnished them ample materials

 Speaking of the Barbary States these authors further say Ibid

 From non Biblical sources says Winchell we obtain further information respecting the early dispersion of the Japhethites or Indo Europeans called also Aryans

 A still further evidence of the civilization of this ancient race is found in the fact that before the dispersion from their original home the Aryans had reached such a degree of development that they possessed a regularly organized religion they worshipped God they believed in an evil spirit they believed in a heaven for the just

 Gentle Lavinia let me kiss thy lips Or make some sign how I may do thee ease Shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius And thou and I sit round about some fountain Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks How they are stain d like meadows yet not dry With miry slime left on them by a flood And in the fountain shall we gaze so long Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness And made a brine pit with our bitter tears Or shall we cut away our hands like thine Or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows Pass the remainder of our hateful days What shall we do let us that have our tongues Plot some device of further misery To make us wonder d at in time to come

 HERMIA Lysander riddles very prettily Now much beshrew my manners and my pride If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied But gentle friend for love and courtesy Lie further off in human modesty Such separation as may well be said Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid So far be distant and good night sweet friend Thy love ne er alter till thy sweet life end LYSANDER Amen amen to that fair prayer say I And then end life when I end loyalty Here is my bed Sleep give thee all his rest HERMIA With half that wish the wisher s eyes be pressed They sleep

 As to the date of the poem in its present form it cannot go back further than about because of the exactness of the rhymes nor could it have been written later than because of certain allusions to it in the sixth book of Parzival which we know to have been written at this date

 On the further advice of the birds Sigurd first fetches the treasure from the cave and then journeys to the mountain Hindarfjall where he rescues the sleeping Valkyrie Sigrdrifu Brynhild Brunhild who stung by the sleep thorn of Wodan and clad in full armor lies asleep within a castle that is surrounded by a wall of flame

 One day however when the ladies go down to the river to take a bath Brynhild will not bathe further down stream than Gudrun that is in the water which flows from Gudrun to her giving as the reason that her father was mightier and her husband braver since he had ridden through the fire while Sigurd had been a menial

 Other Edda songs relate the further adventures of Gudrun but they do not concern us here as the Nibelungenlied stops with the death of the Nibelungs

 After betrothing himself to the maiden he sets forth in search of further adventures and falls into the power of an evil race who by their magic arts lure him to them cause his destruction and then obtain his treasure and the maiden for themselves

 Further up the river that is to the south the Burgundians had established a kingdom in what is now the Rhenish Palatinate their capital being Worms and their king Gundahar or Gundicarius as the Romans called him

 Among the best of these are first the night watch when Folker first plays the Burgundians to sleep with his violin and then stands guard with Hagen thus preventing the surprise planned by Kriemhild further the visit to the church on the following morning when the men of both parties clash and lastly the tournament between the Huns and the Burgundians which gives the author an excellent chance to show the prowess of the various heroes

 A further peculiarity of the Nibelungen strophe is the frequent omission of the unaccented syllable in the second half of the last line of the strophe between the second and third stresses

 In closing this brief study of the Nibelungenlied just a word or two further with reference to the poem its character and its place in German literature

 the name generally appears with a further shifting as Chriemhilt as if the initial consonant were Germanic k 

 Troja was then further corrupted to Tronje and Tronege 

 Siegfried was bold strong and tall he threw the stone still further and made a broader jump

 It is a further development of Siegfried s fight in which he slew Schilbung and Nibelung and became the ruler of the Nibelung land

 Siegfried the valiant knight must needs attend her further

 The mighty king spake further They come to us early on the morrow if ye would greet them set quickly to work that we abide them not within the castle

 Then spake King Gunther I swore an oath that nevermore would I do her harm and will keep it further for she is my sister

 They purveyed them night quarters as far as the Danube s shore but Gunther rode no further than a little from the town

 We must fare further down to Rudeger s land

 At once he ceased to ask for further tidings

 List further to the tale of how ye may cross to the other bank

 Let me counsel you quoth Hagen to beg Sir Dietrich and his good knights to tell you the tidings further and to let you know the Lady Kriemhild s mood

 He is probably confused here with his son for Hagen s stay with Etzel in various legends as also in our poem a few lines further down

 Quoth she Now tell me further why ye did this through the which ye have earned my hate Ye slew Siegfried my dear husband for which I have cause enow to weep until mine end

 Quoth he Now give over these threats and stand further back or I ll wot the armor rings of some with blood

 Those that sprang towards him on the steps to show their prowess he dealt so heavy a sword stroke that for fear they must needs stand further back

 Thus he forced Etzel s warriors to take lodgement further from the hall

 I would not counsel that spake Hagen but bid the Hunnish knights stand further back

 Pray tarry awhile most noble Rudeger so spake Hagen I and my lords would fain have further parley as doth befit our need

 The twain Folker and Hagen stepped further back as they had vowed to him afore

 With murderous intent Gunther and Gernot let him in good heroes they Giselher stood further back which irked him sore in truth

 And still further that this proclamation is intended to present the people of the States wherein the national authority has been suspended and loyal State governments have been subverted a mode in and by which the national authority and loyal State governments may be re established within said States or in any of them and while the mode presented is the best the EXECUTIVE can suggest with his present impressions it must not be understood that no other possible mode would be acceptable

 In my judgment they have aided and will further aid the cause for which they were intended

 The objections to a premature presentation of a plan by the National Executive consist in the danger of committals on points which could be more safely left to further developments

 Please suspend execution in any and all sentences of death in your department until further order

 Whereas at the late session Congress passed a bill to guarantee to certain states whose governments have been usurped or overthrown a republican form of government a copy of which is hereunto annexed and Whereas the said bill was presented to the President of the United States for his approval less than one hour before the sine die adjournment of said session and was not signed by him and Whereas the said bill contains among other things a plan for restoring the States in rebellion to their proper practical relation in the Union which plan expresses the sense of Congress upon that subject and which plan it is now thought fit to lay before the people for their consideration Now therefore I Abraham Lincoln President of the United States do proclaim declare and make known that while I am as I was in December last when by proclamation I propounded a plan for restoration unprepared by a formal approval of this bill to be inflexibly committed to any single plan of restoration and while I am also unprepared to declare that the free State constitutions and governments already adopted and installed in Arkansas and Louisiana shall be set aside and held for naught thereby repelling and discouraging the loyal citizens who have set up the same as to further effort or to declare a constitutional competency in Congress to abolish slavery in States but am at the same time sincerely hoping and expecting that a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery throughout the nation may be adopted nevertheless I am fully satisfied with the system for restoration contained in the bill as one very proper plan for the loyal people of any State choosing to adopt it and that I am and at all times shall be prepared to give the Executive aid and assistance to any such people so soon as the military resistance to the United States shall have been suppressed in any such States and the people thereof shall have sufficiently returned to their obedience to the Constitution and the laws of the United States in which cases militia governors will be appointed with directions to proceed according to the bill

 Winding its way among countless islands and imbedded in mountains the holy lake extended a dozen leagues still further to the south

 With the high plain that there interposed itself to the further passage of the water commenced a portage of as many miles which conducted the adventurer to the banks of the Hudson at a point where with the usual obstructions of the rapids or rifts as they were then termed in the language of the country the river became navigable to the tide

 For many minutes the intricacy of the route admitted of no further dialogue after which they emerged from the broad border of underbrush which grew along the line of the highway and entered under the high but dark arches of the forest

 But when it cuts the ragged hole after a bound or two there is commonly a stagnation of further leaping be it Indian or be it deer We are four able bodies to one wounded man Is life grievous to you interrupted the scout

 At the further extremity of a narrow deep cavern in the rock whose length appeared much extended by the perspective and the nature of the light by which it was seen was seated the scout holding a blazing knot of pine

 A spectral looking figure stalked from out of the darkness behind the scout and seizing a blazing brand held it toward the further extremity of their place of retreat

 He approached the further end of the cavern to an outlet which like the others was concealed by blankets and removing the thick screen breathed the fresh and reviving air from the cataract

 In this manner hours passed without further interruption

 A long and anxious watch succeeded but without any further evidences of a renewed attack and Duncan began to hope that their fire had proved more fatal than was supposed and that their enemies had been effectually repulsed

 When his son pointed out to the experienced warrior the situation of their dangerous enemy the usual exclamatory hugh burst from his lips after which no further expression of surprise or alarm was suffered to escape him

 To us you can be of no further service here but your precious life may be saved for other and nearer friends

 Magua seemed also content to rest the controversy as well as all further communication there for he resumed the leaning attitude against the rock from which in momentary energy he had arisen

 To be delivered into the hands of Sir William Johnson was far preferable to being led into the wilds of Canada but in order to effect even the former it would be necessary to traverse the forest for many weary leagues each step of which was carrying him further from the scene of the war and consequently from the post not only of honor but of duty

 Let him go let him go tis but one man and he without rifle or bow many a long mile from his French commerades and like a rattler that lost his fangs he can do no further mischief until such time as he and we too may leave the prints of our moccasins over a long reach of sandy plain

 The scout who by this time was seated examining into the state of his rifle with a species of parental assiduity now looked up at the other in a displeasure that he did not affect to conceal roughly interrupting further speech

 If my marks do not fail me we shall find the place a few rods further to our left

 The young man was relieved from the awkwardness of making any further protestations of his own demerits by an exclamation from Chingachgook and the attitude of riveted attention assumed by his son

 Then we rallied behind our fallen trees and made head against him under Sir William who was made Sir William for that very deed and well did we pay him for the disgrace of the morning Hundreds of Frenchmen saw the sun that day for the last time and even their leader Dieskau himself fell into our hands so cut and torn with the lead that he has gone back to his own country unfit for further acts in war

 You see we are too obviously within the sentinels of the enemy what course do you propose to follow Yes said Hawkeye rousing himself again tis as you say too late to harbor further thoughts about it

 Further words were unnecessary for Hawkeye merely uttering the mandate to follow moved along the route by which they had just entered their present critical and even dangerous situation

 Have we no further need of them demanded Heyward

 But a narrow opening between the crests of the hills pointed out the passage by which they found their way still further north to spread their pure and ample sheets again before pouring out their tribute into the distant Champlain

 From the woods a little further to the south rose numerous dark and lurid smokes that were easily to be distinguished from the purer exhalations of the springs and which the scout also showed to Heyward as evidences that the enemy lay in force in that direction

 Whenever this unknown individual encountered one of the numberless sentinels who crossed his path his answer was prompt and as it appeared satisfactory for he was uniformly allowed to proceed without further interrogation

 In a moment he saw a dark form rise as it were out of the lake and steal without further noise to the land within a few feet of the place where he himself stood

 Without deigning to bestow further words or to wait for any answer the savage cast his rifle into the hollow of his arm and moved silently through the encampment toward the woods where his own tribe was known to lie

 The savages now fell back and seemed content to let their enemies advance without further molestation

 To me thou canst not be of further use

 They have found the little foot exclaimed the scout moving forward without attending further to his own portion of the duty

 Duncan observed with uneasiness that the scout began to look anxiously about him as if searching for some further means of assisting their flight

 As the Hurons had made no further efforts to conceal their footsteps the progress of the pursuers was no longer delayed by uncertainty

 You see we have reached their settlement or encampment whispered the young man and here is one of the savages himself in a very embarrassing position for our further movements

 He hunts the moose to day with his young men and tomorrow as I hear they pass further into the forests and nigher to the borders of Canada

 You then suspect it is a portion of that people among whom Cora resides The scout nodded his head in assent though he seemed anxious to waive the further discussion of a subject that appeared painful

 He saw at a glance that the circumstance might possibly be improved to further his own ends

 Magua was content with his success or too much occupied with his secret purposes to push his inquiries any further

 Though obliged to come nearly in contact with the monster the Huron who had at first so warily determined the character of his strange visitor was now content with proceeding without wasting a moment in further examination but Heyward was unable to prevent his eyes from looking backward in salutary watchfulness against attacks in the rear

 The bear growled frequently at his heels and once or twice its enormous paws were laid on his person as if disposed to prevent his further passage into the den

 Instead of continuing its discontented growls or manifesting any further signs of anger the whole of its shaggy body shook violently as if agitated by some strange internal convulsion

 So after I had shot the imps I got in pretty nigh to the lodges without further commotion

 Heyward she said looking him full in the face with a touching expression of innocence and dependency give me the sacred presence and the holy sanction of that parent before you urge me further

 I take the woman to a distance where I will strengthen her against any further attacks

 The scout heard them attentively but impatiently and finally closed the discussion by answering in a tone that instantly silenced Alice while it told Heyward how fruitless any further remonstrances would be

 But the bear instead of obeying maintained the seat it had taken and growled The cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued David improving the hint he received they must stand further off

 This time the scout seized the rifle with avidity nor had Magua though he watched the movements of the marksman with jealous eyes any further cause for apprehension

 But their way was becoming intricate in those dark and gloomy passages and the glimpses of the retiring warriors less distinct and frequent and for a moment the trace was believed to be lost when a white robe was seen fluttering in the further extremity of a passage that seemed to lead up the mountain

 Stay dog of the Wyandots exclaimed Uncas shaking his bright tomahawk at Magua a Delaware girl calls stay I will go no further cried Cora stopping unexpectedly on a ledge of rock that overhung a deep precipice at no great distance from the summit of the mountain

 Kill me if thou wilt detestable Huron I will go no further

 But when the labors of the kind beings who had performed these sad and friendly offices were so far completed they hesitated in a way to show that they knew not how much further they might proceed

 To these he added a more solid present of one hundred and forty four thousand Byzantines of gold with a further assurance of two hundred and sixteen thousand so soon as Henry should have entered in arms the Apulian territories and confirmed by an oath the league against the common enemy

 The office of skipper which rather than let the Expedition come to a stand I undertook required no great ability in one not too old to learn it saved a salary and what was much more valuable than gold saved the Expedition from the drawback of any one thinking that he was indispensable to its further progress

 Beyond northwards lie vast fields and forests of palm and tropical trees with the massive mountain of Morambala towering amidst the white clouds and further away more distant hills appear in the blue horizon

 It was as tough a bit of travel as they ever had in Africa and after some painful marching the Badema guides refused to go further the Banyai they said would be angry if they showed white men the country and there was besides no practicable approach to the spot neither elephant nor hippopotamus nor even a crocodile could reach the cataract

 The speech or more probably our bad manners made some impression on our guide for he declined although offered double pay to go any further

 The presence of the steamer which showed that they had an entirely new people to deal with probably contributed to this result for Tingane was notorious for being the barrier to all intercourse between the Portuguese black traders and the natives further inland none were allowed to pass him either way

 After having made in a straight line one hundred miles although the windings of the river had fully doubled the distance we found further progress with the steamer arrested in degrees minutes south by magnificent cataracts which we called The Murchison after one whose name has already a world wide fame and whose generous kindness we can never repay

 The majestic mountain Chipirone to which we have given the name of Mount Clarendon now looms in sight and further to the N

 It was remarked to a number of men near the Shire Lakelet a little further on towards Nyassa You should plant plenty of cotton and probably the English will come and buy it

 Whatever beer is in the house of the deceased is poured out on the ground with the meal and all cooking and water pots are broken as being of no further use

 As things are now the native traders in ivory and malachite have to submit to heavy exactions and if we could give them the same prices which they at present get after carrying their merchandise miles beyond this to the Coast it might induce them to return without going further

 Indeed two of them at this point made up their minds to go no further and turned back to Tette

 We did not find the law in operation in any tribe beyond the range of Portuguese traders or further than the sphere of travel of those Arabs who imitated Portuguese customs in trade

 They told us that plenty of it was seen among the hills but being long ago aware that we were now in an immense coalfield we did not care to examine it further

 The buaze trees and bamboos are now seen on the hills but the jujube or zisyphus which has evidently been introduced from India extends no further up the river

 Moffat introduced the missionaries to his old friend and shows still further that the notion of losing their country by admitting foreigners does not come as the first idea to the native mind

 Willows however grow on the banks and water soon began to appear in the hollows and a few miles further up it was a fine flowing stream deliciously cold

 One of us lay with his head over a projecting crag and watched the descending calico till after his companions had paid out feet the weight rested on a sloping projection probably feet from the water below the actual bottom being still further down

 Further east stands Garden Island then as the river was at its lowest came a good deal of the bare rock of its bed with a score of narrow falls which at the time of flood constitute one enormous cascade of nearly another half mile

 Sacred to what deity would be this awful chasm and that dark grove over which hovers an ever abiding pillar of cloud The ancient Batoka chieftains used Kazeruka now Garden Island and Boaruka the island further west also on the lip of the Falls as sacred spots for worshipping the Deity

 He made no further difficulty about Mr

 The pretty little tianyane or ourebi is abundant further on and herds of blue weldebeests or brindled gnus Katoblepas Gorgon amused us by their fantastic capers

 None but Ma Pulenyane approached the place the others stood at a respectful distance they invariably avoid everything connected with the dead and no such thing as taking portions of human bodies to make charms of as is the custom further north has ever been known among the Makololo

 The crack of the Great Falls was here continued the rocks are the same as further up but perhaps less weather worn and now partially stratified in great thick masses

 The inhabitants complained of hunger and said they had no food to sell and no hut for us to sleep in but if we would only go on a little further we should come to a village where they had plenty to eat but we had travelled far enough and determined to remain where we were

 Next forenoon we halted at the village of our old friend Mbame to obtain new carriers because Chibisa s men never before having been hired and not having yet learned to trust us did not choose to go further

 We followed the river for the most part to avail ourselves of the still reaches for sailing but a comparatively smooth country lies further inland over which a good road could be made

 About the beginning of the upper third the lake is crossed by taking advantage of the island Chizumara which name in the native tongue means the ending further north they go round the end instead though that takes several days

 Still further north the plain becomes more narrow until near where we turned it disappears altogether and the mountains rise abruptly out of the lake forming the north east boundary of what was described to us as an extensive table land well suited for pasturage and agriculture and now only partially occupied by a tribe of Zulus who came from the south some years ago

 Our land party were afraid to go further

 A few miles further another and still larger band of pirates were fallen in with and hundreds of crows and kites hovered over and round the rocks on which they lived

 The boat had gone about minutes further to the north the land party probably half that distance but fever prevented the instruments being used

 The Pioneer s draught being too much for the upper part of the Shire it was not deemed advisable to bring her up on the next trip further than the Ruo the Bishop therefore resolved to explore the country from Magomero to the mouth of that river and to meet the ship with his sisters and Mrs

 A shoal twenty miles below Chibisa s checked our further progress and we lay there five weary weeks till the permanent rise of the river took place

 The excessive fatigue that our friends had undergone in the voyage up to Chibisa s in no wise deterred them from this further attempt for the benefit of their countrymen but the fresh labour with diminished rations was too much for their strength

 Though feeling convinced that it was unfit for navigation except for eight months of the year we pushed on resolved to see if further inland the accounts we had received from different naval officers of its great capabilities would prove correct or if by communication with Lake Nyassa even the upper part could be turned to account

 There was no trade on the river where they lived but beyond that part there was a brisk canoe trade in rice and salt those further in the interior cultivating rice and sending it down the river to be exchanged for salt which is extracted from the earth in certain places on the banks

 Our allies have occupied the Fort of Mosambique for three hundred years but in this as in all other cases have no power further than they can see from a gun carriage

 The height opposite extends a few miles further west and then branches off in a northerly direction

 As we pushed on westwards we found that the river makes a little southing and some reaches were deeper than any near the sea but when we had ascended about miles by the river s course from the sea soft tufa rocks began to appear ten miles beyond the river became more narrow and rocky and when according to our measurement we had ascended miles our further progress was arrested

 The incidents worth noticing were but few seven canoes with loads of salt and rice kept company with us for some days and the further we went inland the more civil the people became

 Near the island there is a rocky rapid with narrow passages fit only for native canoes the fall is small and the banks quite low but these rocks were an effectual barrier to all further progress in boats

 The distance from Ngomano a spot thirty miles further up to the Arab crossing places of Lake Nyassa Tsenga or Kotakota was said to be twelve days

 With all their little comforts destroyed the survivors were thrown still further back into barbarism

 Livingstone s further explorations Effects of slave trade Kirk s range Ajawa migration Native fishermen Arab slave crossing Splendid highlands

 There are several other prominent peaks one for instance still further north called Chirobve

 was in flight before these Mazitu under a chief with the rather formidable name of Mowhiriwhiri we therefore resolved to go on to Chinsamba s still further in the same direction and hear what he said about it

 We liked Chinsamba very well and found that he was decidedly opposed to our risking our lives by going further to the N

 Further on the water was chiefly found in pools and wells

 Then still further in the same direction some watercourses were said to flow into that same Loangwa of the Lake and others into the Loangwa which flows to the south west and enters the Zambesi at Zumbo and is here called the Loangwa of the Maravi

 Here where Arab traders have been the cubit called mokono or elbow begins to take the place of the fathom in use further south

 We were anxious to get off the slave route to people not visited before by traders but Muazi naturally feared that if we went to what is said to be a well watered country abounding in elephants we might relieve him of the ivory which he now obtains at a cheap rate and sells to the slave traders as they pass Kasungu to the east but at last he consented warning us that great difficulty would be experienced in obtaining food a district had been depopulated by slave wars and a night or two must be spent in it but he would give us good guides who would go three days with us before turning and then further progress must depend on ourselves

 Flowing still further in the same direction the Loapula forms Lake Mofue or Mofu and after this it is said to pass the town of Cazembe bend to the north and enter Lake Tanganyika

 Their geographical opinions are now only stated without any further comment than that the itinerary given by the Arabs and others shows that the Loapula is twice crossed on the way to Cazembe s and we may add that we have never found any difficulty from the alleged incapacity of the negro to tell which way a river flows

 The headman of this village of Chinanga was off in a foray against some people further north to supply slaves to the traders expected along the slave route we had just left and was said after having expelled the inhabitants to be living in their stockade and devouring their corn

 Our guide who belonged to the stockade near to which we had slept declined to risk himself further than his home

 It is curious that the taste for red hair should be so general among the Africans here and further north in the south black mica called Sebilo and even soot are used to deepen the colour of the hair here many smear the head with red ochre others plait the inner bark of a tree stained red into it and a red powder called Mukuru is employed which some say is obtained from the ground and others from the roots of a tree

 Here it is called Zimbi further south Mesari and in the centre of the country Meshuati

 Goats and sheep thrive and Nyango the chieftainess further to the south has herds of horned cattle

 It is not likely that their enterprise will lead them further north for Chasundu informed us that the Babisa under sell the agents from Tette

 As will be mentioned further on men were sent with us to bring up more medicine

 On the Alps Whose spurs strike plainwards and on fields of Gaul The cloudy heights of Apennine look down In further distance on his nearer slopes The Sabine turns the ploughshare Umbrian kine And Marsian fatten with his pineclad rocks He girds the tribes of Latium nor leaves Hesperia s soil until the waves that beat On Scylla s cave compel

 Twice called and thrice Antonius lingered still but Caesar thought To reap in full the favour of the gods Not sit supine and knowing danger yields To whom heaven favours he upon the waves Feared by Antonius fleets in shallow boat Embarked and daring sought the further shore

 Driven on the Libyan realms more fruitful here Pompeius stayed the fleet nor further dared In Garamantian waves

 Why further then Seek we our deities Let those who doubt And halting tremble for their coming fates Go ask the oracles

 Now was the heat more dense and through that clime Than which no further on the Southern side The gods permit they trod and scarcer still The water till in middle sands they found One bounteous spring which clustered serpents held Though scaroe the space sufficed

 By further space removed No land than Juba s realm by rumour s voice Drear mournful

 Greatest of the kings By Memphis worshipped Alexander grudged To Nile its mystery and to furthest earth Sent chosen Ethiops whom the crimson zone Stayed in their further march while flowed his stream Warm at their feet

 And now what am I to say further I really do not know beyond once more repeating that everything is described in the accompanying manuscript exactly as it happened

 Can it be that extremes meet and that the very excess and splendour of her mind led her by means of some strange physical reaction to worship at the shrine of matter Was that ancient Kallikrates nothing but a splendid animal loved for his hereditary Greek beauty Or is the true explanation what I believe it to be namely that Ayesha seeing further than we can see perceived the germ and smouldering spark of greatness which lay hid within her lover s soul and well knew that under the influence of her gift of life watered by her wisdom and shone upon with the sunshine of her presence it would bloom like a flower and flash out like a star filling the world with light and fragrance Here also I am not able to answer but must leave the reader to form his own judgment on the facts before him as detailed by Mr

 As this letter added nothing material to my knowledge and certainly raised no further objection in my mind to entering on the task I had promised my dead friend to undertake there was only one course open to me namely to write to Messrs

 Very well answered Leo putting down the miniature at which he had been gazing affectionately and now let us read the letter and without further ado he broke the seal and read aloud as follows My Son Leo When you open this if you ever live to do so you will have attained to manhood and I shall have been long enough dead to be absolutely forgotten by nearly all who knew me

 Before we had gone fifty yards we perceived that all hopes of getting further up the stream in the whale boat were at an end for not two hundred yards above where we had stopped were a succession of shallows and mudbanks with not six inches of water over them

 I do not know that there is any necessity for me to describe the next four days of our voyage in detail further than to say that they were on the whole the most miserable that I ever spent in my life forming one monotonous record of heavy labour heat misery and mosquitoes

 I shrugged my shoulders at this and he proceeded to say that no further instructions had been received on the subject of our disposal and this being so he was about to start to interview She who must be obeyed generally spoken of for the sake of brevity as Hiya or She simply who he gave us to understand was the Queen of the Amahagger and learn her wishes

 Near to the entrance of the cave both pictures and writings were worn away but further in they were in many cases absolutely fresh and perfect as the day on which the sculptor had ceased work on them

 The regiment of guards did not come further than the entrance to the cave where they formed up to let us pass through

 And indeed if any further confirmation was required we had but to look at the wall of the cave above to find it

 No further evidence was taken

 But if thou dost kiss I tell thee of a surety wilt thou eat out thy breast with love of me and die and she bent yet further towards me till her soft hair brushed my brow and her fragrant breath played upon my face and made me faint and weak

 His nerves already seriously shaken by what he had undergone since we had arrived in this terrible country were as may be imagined still further disturbed by the spectacle of these masses of departed humanity whereof the forms still remained perfect before his eyes though their voices were for ever lost in the eternal silence of the tomb

 At six o clock we together with Job waited on Ayesha who set to work to terrify our poor servant still further by showing him pictures on the pool of water in the font like vessel

 She paused awhile and then continued But stay if thy heart is yet hardened against the mighty truth and thou dost require a further pledge of that which thou dost find too deep to understand even now shall it be given to thee and to thee also oh my Holly

 Just as the first ray of the rising sun shot like a golden arrow athwart this storied desolation we gained the further gateway of the outer wall and having given one more glance at the hoar and pillared majesty through which we had journeyed and with the exception of Job for whom ruins had no charms breathed a sigh of regret that we had not had more time to explore it passed through the great moat and on to the plain beyond

 Therefore will I cross the first because no harm will come unto me and without further ado she trod lightly but firmly across the frail bridge and in another second was standing safe upon the heaving stone

 It may be further observed that officers are also particularly attentive to their persons fond of dancing crowded rooms adventures and ridicule

 May not the same remark be applied to women Nay the argument may be carried still further for they are both thrown out of a useful station by the unnatural distinctions established in civilized life

 He carries the arguments which he pretends to draw from the indications of nature still further and insinuates that truth and fortitude the corner stones of all human virtue shall be cultivated with certain restrictions because with respect to the female character obedience is the grand lesson which ought to be impressed with unrelenting rigour

 Gregory goes much further he actually recommends dissimulation and advises an innocent girl to give the lie to her feelings and not dance with spirit when gaiety of heart would make her feet eloquent without making her gestures immodest

 I will go still further and advance without dreaming of a paradox that an unhappy marriage is often very advantageous to a family and that the neglected wife is in general the best mother

 Further should experience prove that they cannot attain the same degree of strength of mind perseverance and fortitude let their virtues be the same in kind though they may vainly struggle for the same degree and the superiority of man will be equally clear if not clearer and truth as it is a simple principle which admits of no modification would be common to both

 I shall not pursue this argument any further than to establish an obvious inference that as sound politics diffuse liberty mankind including woman will become more wise and virtuous

 I am aware that this argument would carry me further than it may be supposed I wish to go but I follow truth and still adhering to my first position I will allow that bodily strength seems to give man a natural superiority over woman and this is the only solid basis on which the superiority of the sex can be built

 I will go further and affirm as an indisputable fact that most of the women in the circle of my observation who have acted like rational creatures or shown any vigour of intellect have accidentally been allowed to run wild as some of the elegant formers of the fair sex would insinuate

 The baneful consequences which flow from inattention to health during infancy and youth extend further than is supposed dependence of body naturally produces dependence of mind and how can she be a good wife or mother the greater part of whose time is employed to guard against or endure sickness nor can it be expected that a woman will resolutely endeavour to strengthen her constitution and abstain from enervating indulgences if artificial notions of beauty and false descriptions of sensibility have been early entangled with her motives of action

 To carry the remark still further if fear in girls instead of being cherished perhaps created were treated in the same manner as cowardice in boys we should quickly see women with more dignified aspects

 I have followed this train of reasoning much further till I have concluded that a person of genius is the most improper person to be employed in education public or private

 A further conclusion obviously presents itself if polygamy be necessary woman must be inferior to man and made for him

 Each sex he further argues should preserve its peculiar tone and manner a meek husband may make a wife impertinent but mildness of disposition on the woman s side will always bring a man back to reason at least if he be not absolutely a brute and will sooner or later triumph over him

 Rousseau would carry his male aristocracy still further for he insinuates that he should not blame those who contend for leaving woman in a state of the most profound ignorance if it were not necessary in order to preserve her chastity and justify the man s choice in the eyes of the world to give her a little knowledge of men and the customs produced by human passions else she might propagate at home without being rendered less voluptuous and innocent by the exercise of her understanding excepting indeed during the first year of marriage when she might employ it to dress like Sophia

 I carry this sentiment still further

 To carry the observation still further modesty must heartily disclaim and refuse to dwell with that debauchery of mind which leads a man coolly to bring forward without a blush indecent allusions or obscene witticisms in the presence of a fellow creature women are now out of the question for then it is brutality

 It is however carried still further and woman weak woman made by her education the slave of sensibility is required on the most trying occasions to resist that sensibility

 A man of delicacy carries his notions of modesty still further for neither weakness nor sensibility will gratify him he looks for affection

 It would be needless to caution you against putting your hand by chance under your neck handkerchief for a modest woman never did so I could proceed still further till I animadverted on some still more indelicate customs which men never fall into

 This sympathy extends still further till a man well pleased observes force in arguments that do not carry conviction to his own bosom and he gladly places in the fairest light to himself the shows of reason that have led others astray rejoiced to find some reason in all the errors of man though before convinced that he who rules the day makes his sun to shine on all

 The formation of the mind must be begun very early and the temper in particular requires the most judicious attention an attention which women cannot pay who only love their children because they are their children and seek no further for the foundation of their duty than in the feelings of the moment

 Forcibly impressed by the reflections which the sight of schools as they are at present conducted naturally suggested I have formerly delivered my opinion rather warmly in favour of a private education but further experience has led me to view the subject in a different light

 This argument may be carried further than philosophers are aware of for if nature destined woman in particular for the discharge of domestic duties she made her susceptible of the attached affections in a great degree

 I have actually heard this barbarous aversion to innovation carried still further and a sensible woman stigmatized as an unnatural mother who has thus been wisely solicitous to preserve the health of her children when in the midst of her care she has lost one by some of the casualties of infancy which no prudence can ward off

 Contending therefore that the sexual distinction which men have so warmly insisted upon is arbitrary I have dwelt on an observation that several sensible men with whom I have conversed on the subject allowed to be well founded and it is simply this that the little chastity to be found amongst men and consequent disregard of modesty tend to degrade both sexes and further that the modesty of women characterized as such will often be only the artful veil of wantonness instead of being the natural reflection of purity till modesty be universally respected

 Over the next months we believe further steps should be taken to refine Rapid Dominance and to develop paper systems and force designs that will add crucial specificity to this concept

 Before proceeding further an example is useful to focus some of the as yet unknowable consequences of these broader realities changes and trends

 The defense industrial base will continue to compress and it is not clear that the necessary level of efficiencies or increases in effectiveness in using this base can be identified and implemented suggesting further pressures on a defense budget that is only likely to be cut

 Based on this subsequent steps will involve expanding mission capability packages concepts consisting of operations harmonized with doctrine organization and systems and then move on to field prototype systems for further test and evaluation as advanced concept technology demonstrations

 Assumptions about reliance on technology and R D providing insurance policies for future defense needs may prove ill advised if and as DOD is forced to cut back and reduce those programs even further

 military capability and further training and education

 If the political objective is to achieve a level of Shock and Awe beyond only temporary paralysis then further actions must follow

 Further assume that Iraq has improved and rebuilt its military and that in a series of simultaneous and nearly instantaneous actions our primary objective was still to shut Iraq down threaten or destroy its leadership and isolate and destroy its military forces as we did in 

 The size of this technological lead between ourselves and the rest of the world especially in the base for new information products and services should widen further in knowledge and in application

 Further the standard to maintain the ability to perform these missions is high and dependent on both resources and on supporting intelligence especially human intelligence not an American strong point

 The classic misfire is the adversary who is not impressed and instead is further provoked to action by the unintended actions of the aggressor

 However the examples suggest that further intellectual and conceptual effort is a worthwhile investment in dealing with national security options in the future

 Finally to return to the idea that deception disinformation and misinformation are crucial aspects of waging war Rapid Dominance would seek to achieve several further capabilities

 Achille Lauro deterrent to further moves e

 The required trust and confidence for sharing sensitive information and support between these agencies and the military needs to be developed further

 This area will be developed further in the computational technologies section

 This is an issue that needs further exploration and analysis

 The required trust and confidence for sharing sensitive information and support between these agencies and the military needs to be developed further

 Do we know the funding tail to such a policy and are we as a nation ready to accept this cost when if Rapid Dominance is applied in situations that are less than of vital interest This subject needs further development beyond the limitations of this book

 The impact of real time video media coverage of these events beamed simultaneously into government headquarters and civilian living rooms worldwide is a phenomenon that impacted events on the battlefield and further highlighted the compassion of that decision

 The lessons learned from this tragic incident as well as the applicability of Rapid Dominance techniques in this environment need further study

 The theory of Rapid Dominance clearly needs further development gaming and simulation

 The Shock and Awe that resulted from the use of these weapons not only brought an abrupt end to the war with Japan through unconditional surrender but have deterred the further use of these weapons for over years

 How to apply elements of Shock and Awe against rogue states terrorist elements international drug and crime cartels as well as in the more traditional MRCs and LRCs needs much further study and analysis

 This list of capabilities would be useful to focus scarce R D dollars to fill in the holes with technology intelligence and surveillance collection priorities innovative thought to further develop the concept War College papers and Wargaming series and development of CINC plans and requirements to meet these capabilities

 I would like to reserve comments in this area until the project is further developed

 The geography of the area of conflict will further define deep strike

 And the substance of the Cyropaedia which is in fact a political romance describing the education of the ideal ruler trained to rule as a benevolent despot over his admiring and willing subjects should add a further element of enjoyment for the reader of this famous book in its English garb

 Further the boys are instructed in temperance and self restraint and they find the utmost help towards the attainment of this virtue in the self respecting behaviour of their elders shown them day by day

 In the same way the youths who have fulfilled the duties of their class are entitled eventually to rank with the men and to share in office and honour but they must first spend their full time among the youths if not they go no further

 But I never got any further in my sentence because the master thrashed me here and said that the verdict would have been excellent if I had been appointed to say what fitted and what did not but I had been called in to decide to whom the coat belonged and the point to consider was who had a right to it Was he who took a thing by violence to keep it or he who had had it made and bought it for his own And the master taught me that what is lawful is just and what is in the teeth of law is based on violence and therefore he said the judge must always see that his verdict tallies with the law

 And now he added what need of further words I will leave you now to choose your own men and when all is ready you will march into Media at their head

 They were no sooner clear of the city so says the story than they met with favourable omens of thunder and lightning and after that they went forward without further divination for they felt that no man could mistake the signs from the Ruler of the gods

 And do you remember said his father how we thought that it would be a noble work enough if a man could train himself really and truly to be beautiful and brave and earn all he needed for his household and himself That we said was a work of which a man might well be proud but if he went further still if he had the skill and the science to be the guide and governor of other men supplying all their wants and making them all they ought to be that it seemed to us would be indeed a marvel

 He drew the distinction between our duty to friends and our duty to enemies and he went further still he taught men that it was just and right to deceive even a friend for his own good or steal his property

 For the rest you do not need me to tell you now how you should draw up your troops or conduct your march by day or night along broad roads or narrow lanes over hills or level ground or how you should encamp and post your pickets or advance into battle or retreat before the foe or march past a hostile city or attack a fortress or retire from it or cross a river or pass through a defile or guard against a charge of cavalry or an attack from lancers or archers or what you should do if the enemy comes into sight when you are marching in column and how you are to take up position against him or how deploy into action if you are in line and he takes you in flank or rear and how you are to learn all you can about his movements while keeping your own as secret as may be these are matters on which you need no further word of mine all that I know about them you have heard a hundred times and I am sure you have not neglected any other authority on whom you thought you could rely

 And further being convinced that wherever the feeling of emulation can be roused there the eagerness to excel is greatest he instituted competitions for everything in which he thought his soldiers should be trained

 There was a further matter to which he gave much care he wished no man to take his meal at morning or at night till he had sweated for it

 Further he always insisted that the army servants should share and share alike with the soldiers in everything for he held that those who did such service for the army were as much to be honoured as heralds or ambassadors

 But when these duties were fulfilled there was no further pause

 Now Cyaxares felt no doubt a certain jealousy that the Persians should be the first to broach the matter but he may also have felt that it was really wiser to run no further risks for the present he had moreover abandoned himself to feasting and merrymaking and he saw that most of his Medes were in like case

 But if we meet them in open country and they learn how to divide their forces and take us in front and flank and rear I wonder how many pairs of eyes and hands each man of us would need Finally he added I have no great wish myself to disturb my Medes in their enjoyment and drive them out to further dangers

 I go further I say that we should leave the distribution of the spoil to the Medes the Hyrcanians and Tigranes and count it gain if they allot us the smaller share for then they will be all the more willing to stay with us

 Further if any man of you comes to us and shows a friendly spirit giving us information and helping us in any way we will treat him not as a servant but as a friend and benefactor

 Tell me then before we go further did you see any wrong in this Was it not rather a service and a kindly act Certainly said Cyaxares so far as that went I saw nothing but kindliness

 You will tell us whether we ought to pursue the campaign further or whether the time has now come to disband our army

 In this interview Cyrus character still further developed

 You sir who command the camel corps will take up your post behind the carriages and look for further orders to Artagersas

 Meanwhile Abradatas and his companions could make no further way there was not a gap through the Egyptian lines on either hand and they could but charge the single soldiers where they stood overthrow them by the sheer weight of horse and car and crush them and their arms beneath the hoofs and wheels

 Further on this day year the city will overflow once more with wealth and beauty

 Now by the gods above us cried Croesus you need take no further thought about your answer if you will do for me what you say I shall live the life that all men called the happiest of lives and I knew that they were right

 When the whole phalanx was in close order they fell back from the walls slowly facing the foe until they were out of range then they turned marched a few paces and then wheeled round again to the left and halted facing the walls but the further they got the less often they paused until feeling themselves secure they quickened their pace and went off in an uninterrupted march until they reached their quarters

 Further he added I foresee another absurd consequence

 If externalism has to be adopted to hedge royalty still a further inner change is demanded there must be a corresponding spiritual growth

 On his side Cyrus looked on the piety of his subjects as a blessing to himself reckoning as they do who prefer to sail in the company of pious men rather than with those who are suspected of wicked deeds and he reckoned further that if all his partners were god fearing they would be the less prone to crime against each other or against himself for he knew he was the benefactor of his fellows

 Further he laid it down that in every matter needing arbitration whether it were a suit at law or a trial of skill the parties should concur in their choice of a judge

 Cyrus noted this and quietly before the man could reach him sent another messenger to say he had no further need of him and that was the last time Da pharnes was ever summoned

 And I believe Cyrus that the man who takes good fortune well is further to seek than he who can endure adversity for success engenders insolence in many hearts while suffering teaches sobriety and fortitude

 Further I think it right that certain of you who live here and yet on whom I may lay the task of travelling to these nations and working for me among them should possess houses there and estates where tribute may be brought them and where they may find a place of their own to lodge in

 On the whole I think Xenophon can t get further

 The night proved so cloudy that I could make no further observations

 at the distance of miles further we passed the mouth of a large creek discharging itself in the center of a deep bend

 and myself were both on shore at that moment a circumstance which rarely happened and tho we were on the shore opposite to the perogue were too far distant to be heard or to do more than remain spectators of her fate in this perogue were embarked our papers Instruments books medicine a great part of our merchandize and in short almost every article indispensibly necessary to further the views or insure the success of the enterprize in which we are now launched to the distance of miles

 Lewis May Wednesday May th as soon as a slight shower of rain passed over this morning we spread the articles to dry which had got wet yesterday in the white perogue tho the day proved so cloudy and damp that they received but little benifit from the sun or air we were enabled to put them in such a state as to prevent their sustaining further injury

 the air is so pure in this open country that mountains and other elivated objects appear much nearer than they really are these mountains do not appear to be further than m

 Clark s black man who had negligently left her in the perogue the rifle was much bent he had also broken the spindle pivit and shattered the stock of one of the bluntderbushes on board with this damage I felt well content happey indeed that we had sustaned no further injury

 to mistake the stream at this period of the season two months of the traveling season having now elapsed and to ascend such stream to the rocky Mountain or perhaps much further before we could inform ourselves whether it did approach the Columbia or not and then be obliged to return and take the other stream would not only loose us the whole of this season but would probably so dishearten the party that it might defeat the expedition altogether

 The parties who had been sent up the rivers in canoes informed that they ascended some distance and had then left their canoes and walked up the rivers a considerable distance further barely leaving themselves time to return the North fork was not so rappid as the other and afforded the easiest navigation of course Six feet appeared to be the shallowest water of the S

 we agreed to go up those rivers one day and a halfs march or further if it should appear necessary to satisfy us more fully of the point in question

 From the ridge at which place I Struck the river last I could discover that the river run west of South a long distance and has a Strong rapid Current as this river Continued its width debth rapidity and the Course west of South going up further would be useless I deturmined to return I accordingly Set out thro the plain on a Course N

 I discovered his danger and the trepedation which he was in gave me still further concern for I expected every instant to see him loose his strength and slip off altho much allarmed at his situation I disguised my feelings and spoke very calmly to him and assured him that he was in no kind of danger to take the knife out of his belt behind him with his wright hand and dig a hole with it in the face of the bank to receive his wright foot which he did and then raised himself to his knees I then directed him to take off his mockersons and to come forward on his hands and knees holding the knife in one hand and the gun in the other this he happily effected and escaped

 I think therefore that we shall find that the Missouri enters the rocky mountains to the North of we did take the liberty of placing his discoveries or at least the Southern extremity of them about a degree further N

 in the sketh which we sent on to the government this spring mearly from the Indian information of the bearing from Fort Mandan of the entrance of the Missouri into the Rocky Mountains and I reather suspect that actual observation will take him at least one other degree further North

 and determined to set out the day after tomorrow I wished to make some further observations at this place and as we had determined to leave our blacksmith s bellows and tools here it was necessary to repare some of our arms and particularly my Airgun the main spring of which was broken before we left this place

 Clark was therefore to make a further deposit in the morning in addition to one Keg of lbs

 I had proceded on this course about two miles with Goodrich at some distance behind me whin my ears were saluted with the agreeable sound of a fall of water and advancing a little further I saw the spray arrise above the plain like a collumn of smoke which would frequently dispear again in an instant caused I presume by the wind which blew pretty hard from the S

 and the party of my success in finding the falls and settle in their minds all further doubts as to the Missouri

 I should have returned from hence but hearing a tremendious roaring above me I continued my rout across the point of a hill a few hundred yards further and was again presented by one of the most beatifull objects in nature a cascade of about fifty feet perpendicular streching at rightangles across the river from side to side to the distance of at least a quarter of a mile

 I took aim at it and fired it instantly disappeared in it s burrow I loaded my gun and exmined the place which was dusty and saw the track from which I am still further convinced that it was of the tiger kind

 we determined to leave the white perogue at this place and substitute the Iron boat and also to make a further deposit of a part of our stores

 Shannon could give me no further account of R

 Clark spoke I determined to visit it today as I could better spare this day from my attention to the boat than probably any other when the work would be further advanced accordingly after seting the hands at their several employments I took Drewyer and seet out for the fountain and passed through a level beautiful plain for about Six miles when I reached the brake of the river hills here we were overtaken by a violent gust of wind and rain from the S

 this evening the hunters returned with the canoes and brought thre buffaloe skins only and two Antelope deer and three wolf skins they reported that the buffaloe had gone further down the river

 but to make any further experiments in our present situation seemed to me madness the buffaloe had principally dserted us and the season was now advancing fast

 I therefore relinquished all further hope of my favorite boat and ordered her to be sunk in the water that the skins might become soft in order the better to take her in peices tomorrow and deposite the iron fraim at this place as it could probably be of no further service to us

 having nothing further to do I amused myself in fishing and caught a few small fish they were of the species of white chub mentioned below the falls tho they are small and few in number

 the wind abated and they came on about miles further and encamped

 Clark s party or mine and had set the plain on fire to allarm the more distant natives and fled themselves further into the interior of the mountains

 the party were so much fortiegued with their march and their feet cut with the flint and perced with the prickly pears untill they had become so painfull that he proceeded but little further before he determined to encamp on the river and wait my arrival

 the country was rough mountainous much as that of yesterday untill towards evening when the river entered a beautifull and extensive plain country of about or miles wide which extended upwards further that the eye could reach this valley is bounded by two nearly parallel ranges of high mountains which have their summits partially covered with snow

 Those mountains are high and a great perportion of them rocky Vallies fertile I observe on the highest pinicals of Some of the mountains to the West Snow lying in Spots Some Still further North are covered with Snow and cant be Seen from this point The Winds in those mountains are not Settled generally with the river to day the wind blow hard from the West at the Camp

 saw a great abundance of the common thistles also a number of the wild onions of which we collected a further supply

 Charbono gave out one of his ankles failed him and he was unable to proceede any further

 at the distance of one mile further we passed the entrance of a small run which falls in just above a rocky clift on Lard

 further we arrived at A

 C s indisposition was a further inducement for my remaining here a couple of days I therefore informed the men of my intention and they put their deer skins in the water in order to prepare them for dressing tomorrow

 we traveled about six miles further and encamped on the stard

 valley in passing which I fell in with a river about yards wide which I waideg and then continued my rout down to it s junction with the river just mentioned and from thence to the entrance of the creek which falls in about miles below still continuing my rout down this stream about three miles further and about M

 still continuing down we passed the entrance of the creek about miles lower down and at the distance of three miles further arrived at it s junction with a river yds

 side about miles further when the mountains put in close on both sides and arrose to great hight partially covered with snow

 Lewis and informed me that they had explored both forks for or miles that the one we were assending was impractiabl much further up turned imediately to the north The middle fork he reported was jintle and after a Short distanc turned to the S

 from the rattle snake Clifts we arrived in a hadsome open and leavel vally where the river divided itself nearly into two equal branches here I halted and examined those streams and readily discovered from their size that it would be vain to attempt the navigation of either any further

 further in a S

 at the distance of miles further the road took us to the most distant fountain of the waters of the mighty Missouri in surch of which we have spent so many toilsome days and wristless nights

 after we had marched about a mile in this order he halted them ang gave a second harang after which six or eight of the young men road forward to their encampment and no further regularity was observed in the order of march

 the Shoshonees do not cultivate this plant but obtain it from the Rocky mountain Indians and some of the bands of their own nation who live further south

 but he added on further enquiry that there was but little more timber below the junction of those rivers than I saw here and that the river was confined between inacessable mountains was very rapid and rocky insomuch that it was impossible for us to pass either by land or water down this river to the great lake where the white men lived as he had been informed

 thus after runing them from five to six or seven miles the fresh horses that were in waiting head them and drive them back persuing them as far or perhaps further quite to the other extreem of the hunters who now in turn pursue on their fresh horses thus worrying the poor animal down and finally killing them with their arrows

 he said that this being the state of the country in that direction that himself nor none of his nation had ever been further down the river than these mountains

 the Chief further informed me that he had understood from the persed nosed Indians who inhabit this river below the rocky mountains that it ran a great way toward the seting sun and finally lost itself in a great lake of water which was illy taisted and where the white men lived

 I saw that any further effort to prevent their going would only add strength to their suspicions and therefore said no more

 to give them further confidence I put my cocked hat with feather on the chief and my over shirt being of the Indian form my hair deshivled and skin well browned with the sun I wanted no further addition to make me a complete Indian in appearance the men followed my example and we were son completely metamorphosed

 I reflected that I had as yet done but little very little indeed to further the hapiness of the human race or to advance the information of the succeeding generation

 after they had turned out their horses and arranged their camp I called the Cheifs and warriors together and addressed them a second time gave them some further presents particularly the second and third Cheifs who it appeared had agreeably to their promise exerted themselves in my favour

 he therefore determined to leave the horses and the majority of the party here and with his guide and three men to continue his rout down the river still further in order more fully to satisfy himself as to it s practicability

 here his guide informed him that by ascending this creek some distance they would have a better road and would cut off a considerable bend which the river made to the south accordingly he pursued a well beaten Indian track which led up this creek about six miles then leaving the creek on the wright he passed over a ridge and at the distance of a mile arrived at the river where it passes through a well timbered bottom of about eighty acres of land they passed this bottom and asscended a steep and elivated point of a mountain from whence the guide shewed him the brake of the river through the mountains for about miles further

 Clark August August rd Friday We Set out early proceed on with great dificuelty as the rocks were So Sharp large and unsettled and the hill sides Steep that the horses could with the greatest risque and dificulty get on no provisions as the Sammons given us yesterday by the Indians were eaten last night one goose killed this morning at miles we came to a place the horses Could not pass without going into the river we passed one mile to a verry bad riffle the water Confined in a narrow Channel beeting against the left Shore as we have no parth further and the Mounts

 side of the river about miles further and encamped on a large creek which falls in on the West as our guide informes that we should leave the river at this place and the weather appearing settled and fair I determined to halt the next day rest our horses and take some scelestial Observations

 had made roads to and below one of the Indians had made a whole to bathe I tasted this water and found it hot not bad tasted The last in further examonation I found this water nearly boiling hot at the places it Spouted from the rocks which a hard Corse Grit and of great size the rocks on the Side of the Mountain of the Same texture I put my finger in the water at first could not bare it in a Second as Several roads led from these Springs in different derections my Guide took a wrong road and took us out of our rout miles through intolerable rout after falling into the right road I proceeded on thro tolerabl rout for abt

 after leaving the ridge we asscended and decended several steep mountains in the distance of miles further when we struck a Creek about yards wide our course being S

 We often pity the poor because they have no leisure to mourn their departed relatives and necessity obliges them to labour through their severest afflictions but is not active employment the best remedy for overwhelming sorrow the surest antidote for despair It may be a rough comforter it may seem hard to be harassed with the cares of life when we have no relish for its enjoyments to be goaded to labour when the heart is ready to break and the vexed spirit implores for rest only to weep in silence but is not labour better than the rest we covet and are not those petty tormenting cares less hurtful than a continual brooding over the great affliction that oppresses us Besides we cannot have cares and anxieties and toil without hope if it be but the hope of fulfilling our joyless task accomplishing some needful project or escaping some further annoyance

 I suggested she had better do so at once and then there would be no further trouble either with remembering or forgetting

 But still I must stay out that day and the following one as I had promised to do so though resisting all entreaties and inducements to prolong my visit further I insisted upon departing the next morning affirming that my mother would be lonely without me and that she impatiently expected my return

 I told him we were doing very well that we had had a considerable addition to our pupils after the Christmas vacation and expected a still further increase at the close of this

 My Diary from which I have compiled these pages goes but little further

 About this time it was that Antigonus the son of Aristobulus came to Caesar and became in a surprising manner the occasion of Antipater s further advancement for whereas he ought to have lamented that his father appeared to have been poisoned on account of his quarrels with Pompey and to have complained of Scipio s barbarity towards his brother and not to mix any invidious passion when he was suing for mercy besides those things he came before Caesar and accused Hyrcanus and Antipater how they had driven him and his brethren entirely out of their native country and had acted in a great many instances unjustly and extravagantly with relation to their nation and that as to the assistance they had sent him into Egypt it was not done out of good will to him but out of the fear they were in from former quarrels and in order to gain pardon for their friendship to his enemy Pompey

 Nor was he mistaken in the conjecture he made for Herod got his army together out of the anger he bare him for his threatening him with the accusation in a public court and led it to Jerusalem in order to throw Hyrcanus down from his kingdom and this he had soon done unless his father and brother had gone out together and broken the force of his fury and this by exhorting him to carry his revenge no further than to threatening and affrighting but to spare the king under whom he had been advanced to such a degree of power and that he ought not to be so much provoked at his being tried as to forget to be thankful that he was acquitted nor so long to think upon what was of a melancholy nature as to be ungrateful for his deliverance and if we ought to reckon that God is the arbitrator of success in war an unjust cause is of more disadvantage than an army can be of advantage and that therefore he ought not to be entirely confident of success in a case where he is to fight against his king his supporter and one that had often been his benefactor and that had never been severe to him any otherwise than as he had hearkened to evil counselors and this no further than by bringing a shadow of injustice upon him

 And do not you disturb yourselves at the quaking of inanimate creatures nor do you imagine that this earthquake is a sign of another calamity for such affections of the elements are according to the course of nature nor does it import any thing further to men than what mischief it does immediately of itself

 So he concealed nothing of the truth but spike thus before his face O Caesar as I was made king of the Jews by Antony so do I profess that I have used my royal authority in the best manner and entirely for his advantage nor will I conceal this further that thou hadst certainly found me in arms and an inseparable companion of his had not the Arabians hindered me

 I do therefore assure thee that I will confirm the kingdom to thee by decree I shall also endeavor to do thee some further kindness hereafter that thou mayst find no loss in the want of Antony

 And when Caesar had further bestowed upon him another additional country he built there also a temple of white marble hard by the fountains of Jordan the place is called Panium where is a top of a mountain that is raised to an immense height and at its side beneath or at its bottom a dark cave opens itself within which there is a horrible precipice that descends abruptly to a vast depth it contains a mighty quantity of water which is immovable and when any body lets down any thing to measure the depth of the earth beneath the water no length of cord is sufficient to reach it

 Many also there were who provoked them further and many of their seeming friends insinuated themselves into their acquaintance to spy out what they did

 When Herod heard this he examined Tero with his son and the barber by the torture but as the others denied the accusation and he said nothing further Herod gave order that Tero should be racked more severely but his son out of pity to his father promised to discover the whole to the king if he would grant that his father should be no longer tortured 

 At length he turned his speech to Pheroras and told him that he would give him his choice of these two things Whether he would keep in with his brother or with his wife And when Pheroras said that he would die rather than forsake his wife Herod not knowing what to do further in that matter turned his speech to Antipater and charged him to have no intercourse either with Pheroras s wife or with Pheroras himself or with any one belonging to her

 These last being put to the torture confessed that they had prevailed with Corinthus for a large sum of money to kill Herod and when they had been further examined before Saturninus the president of Syria they were sent to Rome

 The king was deeply affected with so many suspicions and had the maid servants and some of the free women also tortured one of which cried out in her agonies May that God that governs the earth and the heaven punish this author of all these our miseries Antipater s mother The king took a handle from this confession and proceeded to inquire further into the truth of the matter

 And when he asked them first of all whether they had been so hardy as to cut down the golden eagle they confessed they had done so and when he asked them by whose command they had done it they replied at the command of the law of their country and when he further asked them how they could be so joyful when they were to be put to death they replied because they should enjoy greater happiness after they were dead

 He also reproached him further that his mourning for his father was only pretended while he put on a sad countenance in the day time but drank to great excess in the night from which behavior he said the late disturbance among the multitude came while they had an indignation thereat

 He added further that he would administer the government as a good prince and not like a tyrant for that he would be satisfied with the honor of being called emperor but would in every one of his actions permit them all to give him their advice for that although he had not been by nature for moderation yet would the death of Caius afford him a sufficient demonstration how soberly he ought to act in that station

 You might also see then the high priests themselves with dust sprinkled in great plenty upon their heads with bosoms deprived of any covering but what was rent these besought every one of the eminent men by name and the multitude in common that they would not for a small offense betray their country to those that were desirous to have it laid waste saying What benefit will it bring to the soldiers to have a salutation from the Jews or what amendment of your affairs will it bring you if you do not now go out to meet them and that if they saluted them civilly all handle would be cut off from Florus to begin a war that they should thereby gain their country and freedom from all further sufferings and that besides it would be a sign of great want of command of themselves if they should yield to a few seditious persons while it was fitter for them who were so great a people to force the others to act soberly

 And when they had joined to themselves many of the Sicarii who crowded in among the weaker people that was the name for such robbers as had under their bosoms swords called Sicae they grew bolder and carried their undertaking further insomuch that the king s soldiers were overpowered by their multitude and boldness and so they gave way and were driven out of the upper city by force

 And now the seditious were contented with the victory they had gotten and the buildings they had burnt down and proceeded no further

 The others readily complied with their petition sent to them Gorion the son of Nicodemus and Ananias the son of Sadduk and Judas the son of Jonathan that they might give them the security Of their right hands and of their oaths after which Metilius brought down his soldiers which soldiers while they were in arms were not meddled with by any of the seditious nor was there any appearance of treachery but as soon as according to the articles of capitulation they had all laid down their shields and their swords and were under no further suspicion of any harm but were going away Eleazar s men attacked them after a violent manner and encompassed them round and slew them while they neither defended themselves nor entreated for mercy but only cried out upon the breach of their articles of capitulation and their oaths

 But for Alexandria the sedition of the people of the place against the Jews was perpetual and this from that very time when Alexander the Great upon finding the readiness of the Jews in assisting him against the Egyptians and as a reward for such their assistance gave them equal privileges in this city with the Grecians themselves which honorary reward Continued among them under his successors who also set apart for them a particular place that they might live without being polluted by the Gentiles and were thereby not so much intermixed with foreigners as before they also gave them this further privilege that they should be called Macedonians

 Hereupon Vespasian comforted his army on occasion of what happened and as he found them angry indeed but rather wanting somewhat to do than any further exhortations he gave orders to raise the banks still higher and to erect three towers each fifty feet high and that they should cover them with plates of iron on every side that they might be both firm by their weight and not easily liable to be set on fire

 He was also abused by some as having been a coward and by others as a deserter and the city was full of indignation at him and of reproaches cast upon him their rage was also aggravated by their afflictions and more inflamed by their ill success and what usually becomes an occasion of caution to wise men I mean affliction became a spur to them to venture on further calamities and the end of one misery became still the beginning of another they therefore resolved to fall on the Romans the more vehemently as resolving to be revenged on him in revenging themselves on the Romans

 Consider further that you are to have a conflict with men in effect unarmed while you are well armed with footmen while you are horsemen with those that have no good general while you have one and as these advantages make you in effect manifold more than you are so do their disadvantages mightily diminish their number

 There was also a great slaughter made in the city while those foreigners that had not fled away already made opposition but the natural inhabitants were killed without fighting for in hopes of Titus s giving them his right hand for their security and out of a consciousness that they had not given any consent to the war they avoided fighting till Titus had slain the authors of this revolt and then put a stop to any further slaughters out of commiseration of these inhabitants of the place

 They then poured in over the parts of the wall that were thrown down with a mighty sound of trumpets and noise of armor and with a shout of the soldiers and brake in by force upon those that were in the city but these men fell upon the Romans for some time at their first entrance and prevented their going any further and with great courage beat them back and the Romans were so overpowered by the greater multitude of the people who beat them on every side that they were obliged to run into the upper parts of the city

 Now this was the work of God who therefore preserved this John that he might bring on the destruction of Jerusalem as also it was his work that Titus was prevailed with by this pretense for a delay and that he pitched his camp further off the city at Cydessa

 And indeed though the man was making haste to get away and was tormented with fears of being a captive or of losing his life yet did he prevail with himself to take out of the city along with him a multitude of women and children as far as twenty furlongs but there he left them as he proceeded further on his journey where those that were left behind made sad lamentations for the farther every one of them was come from his own people the nearer they thought themselves to be to their enemies

 So Ananus and his party believed his oath and did now receive him to their consultations without further suspicion nay so far did they believe him that they sent him as their ambassador into the temple to the zealots with proposals of accommodation for they were very desirous to avoid the pollution of the temple as much as they possibly could and that no one of their nation should be slain therein

 He added further that it was by the providence of God he was himself sent as an ambassador to them for an accommodation for that Artanus did therefore offer them such proposals that he might come upon them when they were unarmed that they ought to choose one of these two methods either to intercede with those that guarded them to save their lives or to provide some foreign assistance for themselves that if they fostered themselves with the hopes of pardon in case they were subdued they had forgotten what desperate things they had done or could suppose that as soon as the actors repented those that had suffered by them must be presently reconciled to them while those that have done injuries though they pretend to repent of them are frequently hated by the others for that sort of repentance and that the sufferers when they get the power into their hands are usually still more severe upon the actors that the friends and kindred of those that had been destroyed would always be laying plots against them and that a large body of people were very angry on account of their gross breaches of their laws and illegal judicatures insomuch that although some part might commiserate them those would be quite overborne by the majority

 Now these rulers were greatly surprised at the contents of the letter and at what those that came with it further told them whereupon they ran about the nation like madmen and made proclamation that the people should come to war so a multitude was suddenly got together sooner indeed than the time appointed in the proclamation and every body caught up their arms in order to maintain the liberty of their metropolis and twenty thousand of them were put into battle array and came to Jerusalem under four commanders John and Jacob the son of Sosas and besides these were Simon the son of Cathlas and Phineas the son of Clusothus

 But further whether do they pretend that we who are the rulers of the people have sent thus privately to the Romans or hath it been done by the common suffrages of the people If it be ourselves only that have done it let them name those friends of ours that have been sent as our servants to manage this treachery

 That one may perceive many of themselves now repenting for what they had done and might see the horrid barbarity of those that had invited them and that they had no regard to such as had saved them that they were so impudent as to perpetrate the vilest things under the eyes of those that had supported them and that their wicked actions would be laid to the charge of the Idumeans and would be so laid to their charge till somebody obstructs their proceedings or separates himself from the same wicked action that they therefore ought to retire home since the imputation of treason appears to be a Calumny and that there was no expectation of the coming of the Romans at this time and that the government of the city was secured by such walls as cannot easily be thrown down and by avoiding any further fellowship with these bad men to make some excuse for themselves as to what they had been so far deluded as to have been partners with them hitherto

 Those that were called Sicarii had taken possession of it formerly but at this time they overran the neighboring countries aiming only to procure to themselves necessaries for the fear they were then in prevented their further ravages

 Accordingly when every one of them had plundered their own villages they then retired into the desert yet were these men that now got together and joined in the conspiracy by parties too small for an army and too many for a gang of thieves and thus did they fall upon the holy places and the cities yet did it now so happen that they were sometimes very ill treated by those upon whom they fell with such violence and were taken by them as men are taken in war but still they prevented any further punishment as do robbers who as soon as their ravages are discovered run their way

 These horsemen at the first onset gave way a little as contriving to entice them further off the wall and when they had drawn them into a place fit for their purpose they made their horse encompass them round and threw their darts at them

 Now Placidus s concern was to exclude them in their flight from getting into the village and causing his horse to march continually on that side of them he then turned short upon them and at the same time his men made use of their darts and easily took their aim at those that were the nearest to them as they made those that were further off turn back by the terror they were in till at last the most courageous of them brake through those horsemen and fled to the wall of the village

 And as this sorrow of his was violent he was not able to support the torments he was under nor to apply himself further in other wars when his native country was laid waste but then as much as his passion excited him to avenge his country so much was he restrained by the consideration of his distance therefrom because fortune might prevent him and do a world of mischief before he could himself sail over the sea to Italy especially as it was still the winter season so he restrained his anger how vehement soever it was at this time

 Whether therefore we estimate the capacity of governing from the skill of a person in years we ought to have Vespasian or whether from the strength of a young man we ought to have Titus for by this means we shall have the advantage of both their ages for that they will afford strength to those that shall be made emperors they having already three legions besides other auxiliaries from the neighboring kings and will have further all the armies in the east to support them as also those in Europe so they as they are out of the distance and dread of Vitellius besides such auxiliaries as they may have in Italy itself that is Vespasian s brother and his other son Domitian the one of whom will bring in a great many of those young men that are of dignity while the other is intrusted with the government of the city which office of his will be no small means of Vespasian s obtaining the government

 Upon the whole the case may be such that if we ourselves make further delays the senate may choose an emperor whom the soldiers who are the saviors of the empire will have in contempt

 Titus also pressed upon those that were near him and sent the legion again to fortify their camp while he and those that were with him before opposed the enemy and kept them from doing further mischief insomuch that if I may be allowed neither to add any thing out of flattery nor to diminish any thing out of envy but to speak the plain truth Caesar did twice deliver that entire legion when it was in jeopardy and gave them a quiet opportunity of fortifying their camp

 So Caesar complied with their desires and with what prudence dictated to him also for he esteemed it fit to punish single persons by real executions but that the punishment of great multitudes should proceed no further than reproofs so he was reconciled to the soldiers but gave them a special charge to act more wisely for the future and he considered with himself how he might be even with the Jews for their stratagem

 The beginning of the third wall was at the tower Hippicus whence it reached as far as the north quarter of the city and the tower Psephinus and then was so far extended till it came over against the monuments of Helena which Helena was queen of Adiabene the daughter of Izates it then extended further to a great length and passed by the sepulchral caverns of the kings and bent again at the tower of the corner at the monument which is called the Monument of the Fuller and joined to the old wall at the valley called the Valley of Cedron

 This court was four square and had a wall about it peculiar to itself the height of its buildings although it were on the outside forty cubits was hidden by the steps and on the inside that height was but twenty five cubits for it being built over against a higher part of the hill with steps it was no further to be entirely discerned within being covered by the hill itself

 As to the holy house itself which was placed in the midst of the inmost court that most sacred part of the temple it was ascended to by twelve steps and in front its height and its breadth were equal and each a hundred cubits though it was behind forty cubits narrower for on its front it had what may be styled shoulders on each side that passed twenty cubits further

 But the superior part of the temple had no such little houses any further because the temple was there narrower and forty cubits higher and of a smaller body than the lower parts of it

 Now the stones that were cast were of the weight of a talent and were carried two furlongs and further

 But Castor and his companions set the tower on fire when it began to give way and leaped through the flame into a hidden vault that was under it which made the Romans further suppose that they were men of great courage as having cast themselves into the fire

 He added this further how right a thing it was to change their conduct before their calamities were become incurable and to have recourse to such advice as might preserve them while opportunity was offered them for so doing for that the Romans would not be mindful of their past actions to their disadvantage unless they persevered in their insolent behavior to the end because they were naturally mild in their conquests and preferred what was profitable before what their passions dictated to them which profit of theirs lay not in leaving the city empty of inhabitants nor the country a desert on which account Caesar did now offer them his right hand for their security

 The indication they made use of whether they had any or not was taken from the bodies of these miserable wretches which if they were in good case they supposed they were in no want at all of food but if they were wasted away they walked off without searching any further nor did they think it proper to kill such as these because they saw they would very soon die of themselves for want of food

 That therefore his opinion was that if they aimed at quickness joined with security they must build a wall round about the whole city which was he thought the only way to prevent the Jews from coming out any way and that then they would either entirely despair of saving the city and so would surrender it up to him or be still the more easily conquered when the famine had further weakened them for that besides this wall he would not lie entirely at rest afterward but would take care then to have banks raised again when those that would oppose them were become weaker

 They also slew such as joined in lamenting these men without any further examination

 After this man there ran away to Titus many of the eminent citizens and told him the entire number of the poor that were dead and that no fewer than six hundred thousand were thrown out at the gates though still the number of the rest could not be discovered and they told him further that when they were no longer able to carry out the dead bodies of the poor they laid their corpses on heaps in very large houses and shut them up therein as also that a medimnus of wheat was sold for a talent and that when a while afterward it was not possible to gather herbs by reason the city was all walled about some persons were driven to that terrible distress as to search the common sewers and old dunghills of cattle and to eat the dung which they got there and what they of old could not endure so much as to see they now used for food

 They had further difficulties also upon them sometimes by their over great security they were in that they should overcome the Jewish snares laid for them and by that boldness of the Jews which their despair of escaping had inspired them withal for some of their horsemen when they went out to gather wood or hay let their horses feed without having their bridles on during the time of foraging upon which horses the Jews sallied out in whole bodies and seized them

 In the mean time the Jews were so distressed by the fights they had been in as the war advanced higher and higher and creeping up to the holy house itself that they as it were cut off those limbs of their body which were infected in order to prevent the distemper s spreading further for they set the north west cloister which was joined to the tower of Antonia on fire and after that brake off about twenty cubits of that cloister and thereby made a beginning in burning the sanctuary two days after which or on the twenty fourth day of the forenamed month Panemus or Tamuz the Romans set fire to the cloister that joined to the other when the fire went fifteen cubits farther

 Now the Jews admired this man for his courage and were further desirous of having him slain so they persuaded him to come down to them upon security given him for his life

 So he ordered this proclamation to be made to them That they should no more come out to him as deserters nor hope for any further security for that he would henceforth spare nobody but fight them with his whole army and that they must save themselves as well as they could for that he would from henceforth treat them according to the laws of war

 Accordingly as the people were now slain the holy house was burnt down and the city was on fire there was nothing further left for the enemy to do

 The reader is to observe further that the true reason why I have so seldom taken notice of those completions in the course of these notes notwithstanding their being so very remarkable and frequently so very obvious is this that I had entirely prevented myself in that treatise beforehand to which therefore I must here once for all seriously refer every inquisitive reader

 Besides these five here enumerated who had taken Jerusalem of old Josephus upon further recollection reckons a sixth Antiq

 He said further that it was but reasonable for them to put an end to this war now it had lasted so long for that they had nothing better to wish for when they entered into it and that this happened more favorably for them and more for their glory that all the Romans had willingly accepted of those for their governors and the curators of their dominions whom they had chosen for them and had sent into their own country for that purpose which still continued under the management of those whom they had pitched on and were thankful to them for pitching upon them

 But when Collegas had made a careful inquiry into the matter he found out the truth and that not one of those Jews that were accused by Antiochus had any hand in it but that all was done by some vile persons greatly in debt who supposed that if they could once set fire to the market place and burn the public records they should have no further demands made upon them

 He had a courageous mind from his father and had made greater improvements than belonged to such an age accordingly he marched against the barbarians immediately whereupon their hearts failed them at the very rumor of his approach and they submitted themselves to him with fear and thought it a happy thing that they were brought under their old yoke again without suffering any further mischiefs

 Now this was in reality no better than a pretense and a cloak for the barbarity which was made use of by them and to color over their own avarice which they afterwards made evident by their own actions for those that were partners with them in their rebellion joined also with them in the war against the Romans and went further lengths with them in their impudent undertakings against them and when they were again convicted of dissembling in such their pretenses they still more abused those that justly reproached them for their wickedness

 Now that the earth might not fall away upon the elevation of this bank to a greater height they further laid other beams over cross them and thereby bound those beams together that lay lengthways

 However neither did Eleazar once think of flying away nor would he permit any one else to do so but when he saw their wall burned down by the fire and could devise no other way of escaping or room for their further courage and setting before their eyes what the Romans would do to them their children and their wives if they got them into their power he consulted about having them all slain

 It is true the power of the soul is great even when it is imprisoned in a mortal body for by moving it after a way that is invisible it makes the body a sensible instrument and causes it to advance further in its actions than mortal nature could otherwise do

 Nay indeed lest any Jews that lived elsewhere should convict him of his villainy he extended his false accusations further and persuaded Jonathan and certain others that were caught with him to bring an accusation of attempts for innovation against the Jews that were of the best character both at Alexandria and at Rome

 However this plot thus contrived by Catullus did not succeed according to his hopes for though he came himself to Rome and brought Jonathan and his companions along with him in bonds and thought he should have had no further inquisition made as to those lies that were forged under his government or by his means yet did Vespasian suspect the matter and made an inquiry how far it was true

 Accordingly they went on without stopping fording the RIO of Los Huasos and also the Chapaleofu a few miles further on

 After this there was nothing further to do at Fort Independence but to shake hands with the Commandant and thank him and take leave

 About a mile further he stopped again and leaving the straight route made a circuit of some miles north and south and then returned and fell back in his place at the head of the troop without saying a syllable as to what he hoped or feared

 Where could they commence a fresh quest What grief Lady Helena and Mary Grant would feel on hearing there was no further hope

 In that same year Louis Vas de Torres the second in command of the fleet of Quiros pushed further south

 The interest he excited was still further heightened by the marks of recent suffering imprinted on his countenance

 IV Verne Great admiration was bestowed on this bird and the Major s spoil would have borne the honors of the day had not Robert come across an animal a few miles further on and bravely killed it

 They looked at each other hardly knowing what to do till Ayrton proposed he should go to Black Point Station twenty miles further north and bring back a blacksmith with him

 All right said Ayrton and forbore to press the matter further

 For five miles further the horses were still treading the station lands

 Further on these protuberances rising sharply formed the first steps of the great Alps

 The climate you know Miss Mary the regenerative climate Here the poor SAVANT stuck fast unable to get further like the wagon in the mud

 Then he got up and went out of the wagon gesticulating and repeating the incomprehensible words Aland aland aland CHAPTER XVIII FOUR DAYS OF ANGUISH THE rest of the day passed on without any further incident

 Glenarvan searched no further

 He wanted to say a word further in the Captain s interest but Mary stopped him with a glance and afterward said to him No Mr

 Whether for this reason or for some other Paganel did not connect any idea of further search with this proposition of reaching Auckland

 But no indication was seen that could suggest further search in that quarter all trace of the wreck escaped them still

 It seemed doubtful whether she would go about without further damage

 They keep further north for Auckland further south for New Plymouth and the ship had struck just between these two points on the desert region of the shores of Ika na Mani a dangerous difficult coast and infested by desperate characters

 Therefore my lord we have nothing to detain us further

 But he decided that further delay was not to be thought of and an ax blow committed the raft to the mercy of the wind assisted by a current of two knots an hour

 According to the map which Paganel constantly referred to the confluence of the Waipa and Waikato ought to be reached about five miles further on and there the night halt could be made

 Glenarvan asked no further questions but hope revived in his heart

 He knew that the English and German naturalists had never penetrated further than its junction with the Waipa

 This lasted for three days to the inquiry whether he was well treated he said Yes and no without further answer he was a prisoner and except that he expected immediate execution his state seemed to him no better than that in which he had left his unfortunate friends

 More than we can use replied Paganel without any further explanation

 Further off toward the pah the lava had reached a group of twenty huts which were still smoking

 The courageous women could not be pressed further and besides the locality was suitable for camping

 When he mentioned Captain Grant John always spoke of further search

 They wished to put some further questions to him

 And yet he was prepared to go still further in disinterestedness

 This study in turn should aim first at an understanding of the literature as an expression of the authors views of life and of their personalities and especially as a portrayal and interpretation of the life of their periods and of all life as they have seen it it should aim further at an appreciation of each literary work as a product of Fine Art appealing with peculiar power both to our minds and to our emotions not least to the sense of Beauty and the whole higher nature

 Further one may ask whether the author has a deliberately formed theory of life and if so how it shows itself and of course how sound it is

 In its subtlest operations further Imagination penetrates below the surface and comprehends and brings to light the deeper forces and facts the real controlling instincts of characters the real motives for actions and the relations of material things to those of the spiritual world and of Man to Nature and God

 If there are several of them it is a further question whether the author properly contrasts them in such a way as to secure interest

 It may be asked further of poetry whether the meter and stanza structure are appropriate to the mood and thought and so handled as to bring out the emotion effectively and whether the sound is adapted to the sense for example musical where the idea is of peace or quiet beauty 

 The Britons from whom the present Welsh are descended inhabited what is now England and Wales and they were still further subdivided like most barbarous peoples into many tribes which were often at war with one another

 Their bleak country where the foggy and unhealthy marshes of the coast gave way further inland to vast and somber forests developed in them during their long inactive winters a sluggish and gloomy mood in which however the alternating spirit of aggressive enterprise was never quenched

 Early in the sixth century for example they won at Mount Badon in the south a great victory later connected in tradition with the legendary name of King Arthur which for many years gave them security from further aggressions

 This sentiment was finally to be confirmed by the loss of Normandy and other French possessions of the Norman English kings in the thirteenth century a loss which transformed England from a province of the Norman Continental empire and of a foreign nobility into an independent country and further by the wars The Hundred Years War which England Norman nobility and Saxon yeomen fighting together carried on in France in the fourteenth century

 The study of the literature of the period is further complicated by the division of English into dialects

 Further than this we know of him only that he wrote Le Morte Darthur and had finished it by 

 Little by little probably as time passed this Easter scene was further enlarged in part by additions from the closing incidents of the Savior s life

 Other Biblical scenes as well came to be enacted and further there were added stories from Christian tradition such as that of Antichrist and on their particular days the lives of Christian saints

 By the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries further the Italians had become intellectually one of the keenest races whom the world has ever known though in morals they were sinking to almost incredible corruption

 Before Chaucer was dead the study of Greek almost forgotten in Western Europe during the Middle Ages had been renewed in Italy and it received a still further impulse when at the taking of Constantinople by the Turks in Greek scholars and manuscripts were scattered to the West

 Further both Henries though perhaps as essentially selfish and tyrannical as almost any of their predecessors were politic and far sighted and they took a genuine pride in the prosperity of their kingdom

 Further though his poems are less numerous than those of Wyatt his range of subjects is somewhat broader including some appreciative treatment of external Nature

 But this use of the Italian romances further carries with it a large employment of characters incidents and imagery from classical mythology and literature among other things the elaborated similes of the classical epics

 Still further the characteristic Renaissance lack of certainty as to the proper materials for poetry is sometimes responsible for a rudely inharmonious element in the otherwise delightful romantic atmosphere

 Two further sentences of Lowell well summarize his whole general achievement His great merit is in the ideal treatment with which he glorified common things and gilded them with a ray of enthusiasm

 Shortly after the middle of the century probably the head master of Westminister School Nicholas Udall took the further step of writing for his boys on the classical model an original farce comedy the amusing Ralph Roister Doister

 Meanwhile students at the universities also had been acting Plautus and Terence and further had been writing and acting Latin tragedies as well as comedies of their own composition

 The character of Lyly s plays was largely determined by the light and spectacular nature of these entertainments and further by the fact that on most occasions the players at Court were boys

 These plays were to exert a strong influence on Shakspere s early comedies probably suggesting to him the use of prose for comedy the value of snappy and witty dialog refinement as well as affectation of style lyric atmosphere the characters and tone of high comedy contrasting so favorably with the usual coarse farce of the period and further such details as the employment of impudent boy pages as a source of amusement

 The distinction between the two sorts of drama was still further broken down in the work of Christopher Marlowe a poet of real genius decidedly the chief dramatist among Shakspere s early contemporaries and the one from whom Shakspere learned the most

 No theory further could be more preposterous to any one really acquainted with literature than the idea that the imaginative poetry of Shakspere was produced by the essentially scientific and prosaic mind of Francis Bacon

 His characteristic comedies all belong further to the particular type which he himself originated namely the Comedy of Humors

 Nevertheless this period includes in prose one writer greater than any prose writer of the previous century namely Francis Bacon and further the book which unquestionably occupies the highest place in English literature that is the King James version of the Bible and in poetry it includes one of the very greatest figures John Milton together with a varied and highly interesting assemblage of lesser lyrists

 The hold of medieval scholarly tradition it is further interesting to note was still so strong that in order to insure their permanent preservation Bacon translated them into Latin he took for granted that the English in which he first composed them and in which they will always be known was only a temporary vulgar tongue

 We may give a further word of mention to the voluminous Francis Quarles who in his own day and long after enjoyed enormous popularity especially among members of the Church of England and especially for his Emblems a book of a sort common in Europe for a century before his time in which fantastic woodcuts like Vaughan s Silex Scintillans were illustrated with short poems of religious emotion chiefly dominated by fear

 The sonnet on his twenty third birthday further is known to almost every reader of poetry as the best short expression in literature of the dedication of one s life and powers to God

 Here for nearly six years amid surroundings which nourished his poet s love for Nature he devoted his time chiefly to further mastery of the whole range of approved literature Greek Latin French Italian and English

 Further Milton s personal English and Puritan prejudices sometimes intrude in various ways

 Its language and style further are founded on the noble and simple model of the English Bible which was almost the only book that Bunyan knew and with which his whole being was saturated

 Pilgrim s Progress is perfectly intelligible to any child and further it is highly dramatic and picturesque

 The incidents however have all the further fascination of supernatural romance and the union of this element with the homely sincerity of the style accounts for much of the peculiar quality of the book

 These plays dealing mostly with love actions in the setting of the Court or of fashionable London life and carrying still further the general spirit of those of Fletcher and Shirley a generation or two earlier deliberately ridicule moral principles and institutions especially marriage and are always in one degree or another grossly indecent

 He had the further mortification of seeing the very Shadwell whom he had so unsparingly ridiculed replace him as poet laureate

 These romances carrying further the tendency which appears in Sidney s Arcadia are among the most extravagant of all products of the romantic imagination strange m langes of ancient history medieval chivalry pastoralism seventeenth century artificial manners and allegory of current events

 In the field of his main interest further his reason was persuaded by the pseudo classical arguments that English Elizabethan tragedy with its violent contrasts and irregularity was theoretically wrong

 The main characteristics of the period and its literature continue with some further development those of the Restoration and may be summarily indicated as follows 

 The men of this age carried still further the distrust and dislike felt by the previous generation for emotion enthusiasm and strong individuality both in life and in literature and exalted Reason and Regularity as their guiding stars

 Further it directly addresses the dissenting conscience in its emphasis on religion and morality

 Cato further was a main cause of a famous quarrel between Addison and Pope

 Pope accepted this hint as his guiding principle and proceeded to seek correctness by giving still further polish to the pentameter couplet of Dryden

 Further Johnson s indolence and prejudices are here again evident often when he did not know the facts he did not take the trouble to investigate a thorough Tory himself he was often unfair to men of Whig principles and for poetry of the delicately imaginative and romantic sort his rather painfully practical mind had little appreciation

 It is an interesting paradox that while Johnson s reputation as the chief English man of letters of his age seems secure for all time his works for the most part do not belong to the field of pure literature and further have long ceased almost altogether to be read

 He was rewarded by the gift of sinecure offices from the government and did some further writing including probably the patriotic lyric Rule Britannia and also pseudo classical tragedies but his only other poem of much importance is The Castle of Indolence a subject appropriate to his own good natured easy going disposition which appeared just before his death in 

 Further romantic as he was in spirit he was not able to free himself from the pseudo classical mannerisms every page of his poem abounds with the old lifeless phraseology the finny tribes for the fishes the vapoury whiteness for the snow or the hard won treasures of the year for the crops

 His Ode on the Popular Superstitions of the Highlands further was one of the earliest pieces of modern literature to return for inspiration to the store of medieval supernaturalism in this case to Celtic supernaturalism

 The extravagance of romantic writers at that time further created a sort of subspecies called in its day and since the Gothic romance

 To Coleridge who was slightly the younger of the two attaches the further pathetic interest of high genius largely thwarted by circumstances and weakness of will

 The complete degeneration of the Revolution into anarchy and tyranny further served to plunge him into a chaos of moral bewilderment from which he was gradually rescued partly by renewed communion with Nature and partly by the influence of his sister Dorothy a woman of the most sensitive nature but of strong character and admirable good sense

 Scott further is personally one of the most delightful figures in English literature and he is probably the most famous of all the Scotsmen who have ever lived

 For a dozen years before it should be added his inexhaustible energy had found further occupation in connection with a troop of horse which he had helped to organize on the threat of a French invasion and of which he acted as quartermaster training in barracks and at times drilling for hours before breakfast

 But interest seldom greatly slackens until the end which it must be further confessed is often suddenly brought about in a very inartistic fashion

 Whether had he lived he would have proved capable of handling them significantly is one of the questions which must be left to conjecture like the other question whether his power of style would have further developed

 Still further to Ruskin morality and religion are inseparable from Art so that he deals searchingly if incidentally with those subjects as well

 In further he was rejected in marriage by a young girl for whom he had formed a deep attachment and who on her death bed three years later refused with strange cruelty to see him

 Further the restless stirrings of his age beginning to arouse itself from the social lethargy of centuries appeared to him pitifully unintelligent and devoid of results

 Two volumes of poems which he published in and were greeted by the critics with their usual harshness which deeply wounded his sensitive spirit and checked his further publication for ten years though the second of these volumes contains some pieces which in their later revised form are among his chief lyric triumphs

 His engagement with Miss Eleanor Siddal a milliner s apprentice whose face appears in many of his pictures was prolonged by his lack of means for nine years further he was an agnostic while she held a simple religious faith and she was carrying on a losing struggle with tuberculosis

 The Romanticism appears further in the volcanic but sometimes melodramatic power of the love story where the heroine is a somewhat idealized double of the authoress and where the imperfect portrayal of the hero reflects the limitations of Miss Bront s own experience

 With Froude too this results in exaggeration and further he is sadly inaccurate but his books are splendidly fascinating

 In addition to the special questions here included the treatment of the various authors in the text often suggests topics for further consideration and of course the material of the preliminary chapter is assumed

 Francis Vavassor a learned French jesuit entered at greater length on this subject and produced further proofs from internal evidence from the use of the word Piraeus in describing the harbour of Athens a name which was not given till two hundred years after Aesop and from the introduction of other modern words that many of these fables must have been at least committed to writing posterior to the time of Aesop and more boldly suggests Babrias as their author or collector

 The Imperial Government merely gave land and did not take one third of the proposed guarantee and the following further memorandum was sent to me Although little disposed to believe that Her Majesty s Government will not accede to the proposal of co operation they have made in relation to the opening of communication from Canada to the Pacific the undersigned have the honour to state in answer to the letter of Mr

 And if further proof were wanting that these gentlemen deserved the previously quoted strictures of the Duke always bearing in mind the trouble responsibility and expense incurred mainly at their instance upon the Pacific project the following gives it No

 Her Majesty s Government are further of opinion that without a submarine Transatlantic telegraph the proposed line in America will be of comparatively small value to the Imperial Government and that whenever a scheme of the former kind is renewed it is almost certain that this country must be called upon to bear a much larger charge for it than that which it is now proposed to devolve upon the British Colonies in respect of the land telegraph and communication

 It will however be necessary before any proposal is made officially to the Colonies that the Duke of Newcastle should receive further details

 His Grace takes for granted that if the Imperial Government and that of British Columbia should find on further inquiry that some other point on the coast would supply a more convenient terminus the Company would be ready to adopt it

 His Grace sees no objection to the grant of land contemplated in this Article but the rights stipulated for are so indeterminate that without further explanation they could scarcely be promised in the shape in which they are asked

 Subject to these observations and to such questions of detail as further consideration may elicit the Duke of Newcastle cordially approves of the Company s proposals and is prepared to sanction the grants of land contemplated in the rd Article

 That charter began thus Charles the Second by the grace of God King of England Scotland France and Ireland Defender of the Faith to all to whom these presents shall come greeting Whereas our dear intirely beloved cousin Prince Rupert Count Palatine of the Rhine Duke of Bavaria and Cumberland George Duke of Albemarle William Earl of Craven Henry Lord Arlington Anthony Lord Ashley Sir John Robinson and Sir Robert Vyner Knights and Baronets Sir Peter Colleton Baronet Sir Edward Hungerford Knight of the Bath Sir Paul Neele Sir John Griffith Sir Philip Carteret and Sir James Hayes Knights John Kirke Francis Millington William Prettyman John Fenn Esquires and John Portman citizen and goldsmith of London have at their own great costs and charges undertaken an expedition for Hudson s Bay in the Northwest parts of America for the discovery of a new passage into the South Sea and for the finding of some trade for furs minerals and other considerable commodities and by such their undertaking have already made such discoveries as do encourage them to proceed farther in pursuance of their said design by means whereof there may probably arise great advantage to us and our kingdom And whereas the said undertakers for their further encouragement in the said design have humbly besought us to incorporate them and grant unto them and their successors the whole trade and commerce of all those seas streights and bays rivers lakes creeks and sounds in whatsoever latitude they shall be that lie within the entrance of the streights commonly called Hudson s Streights together with all the lands countries and territories upon the coasts and confines of the seas streights bays lakes rivers creeks and sounds aforesaid which are not now actually possessed by any of our subjects or by the subjects of any other Christian Prince or State

 It will be seen that one object aimed at in granting a charter to the Hudson s Bay Company was to further the discovery of the North west Passage

 Edward Thompson who had been a ship surgeon being examined as to the probability of a North west Passage said He had the greatest reason to believe there is one from the winds tides and black whales and he thinks the place to be at Chesterfield s inlet that the reason of their coming back was they met the other boat which had been five leagues further and the crew told them the water was much fresher and shallower there but where he was the water was fifty fathoms deep and the tide very strong the ebb six hours and the flood two to the best of his remembrance that it is not common for the tide to flow only two hours but he imagines it to be obstructed by another tide from the westward that the rapidity of the tide upwards was so great that the spray of the water flew over the bow of the schooner and was so salt that it candied on men s shoes but that the tide did not run in so rapid a manner the other way

 Captain William Moore being asked whether he believed there was a North west Passage to the South Seas said He believes there is a communication but whether navigable or not he cannot say that if there is any such communication tis further northward than he expected that if it is but short as tis probable to conclude from the height of the tides tis possible it might be navigable and it was the opinion of all the persons sent on that discovery that a north west wind made the highest tides

 And it was further Resolved that in the opinion of this Committee that each subscriber shall have l

 In further testimony a member of Congress said on the th March on the debate on the abortive Bill for regulating trade with British North American Provinces Mr

 Endnote The Government of the United States being equally desirous with Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain to avoid further misunderstanding between their respective citizens and subjects in regard to the extent of the right of fishing on the coasts of British North America secured to each by Article I of a Convention between the United States and Great Britain signed at London on the th day of October and being also desirous to regulate the commerce and navigation between their respective territories and people and more especially between Her Majesty s possessions in North America and the United States in such manner as to render the same reciprocally beneficial and satisfactory have respectively named Plenipotentiaries to confer and agree thereupon that is to say the President of the United States of America William L

 It is further agreed that British subjects shall have the right freely to navigate Lake Michigan with their vessels boats and crafts so long as the privilege of navigating the river St

 And it is further agreed that no export duty or other duty shall be levied on lumber or timber of any kind cut on that portion of the American territory in the State of Maine watered by the river St

 Such assent having been given the treaty shall remain in force for ten years from the date at which it may come into operation and further until the expiration of twelve months after either of the high contracting parties shall give notice to the other of its wish to terminate the same each of the high contracting parties being at liberty to give such notice to the other at the end of the said term of ten years or at any time afterwards It is clearly understood however that this stipulation is not intended to affect the reservation made by article four of the present treaty with regard to the right of temporarily suspending the operation of articles three and four thereof

 At the same time they are further evidence of Mr

 I think therefore that I should be as deficient in public duty as in generosity if I did not evince my gratitude for your unsolicited remembrance by saying that should the difficulty I allude to be found really to exist I shall not feel myself slighted or aggrieved should your kindness proceed no further pending such an unfortunate state of feeling

 First you ask the Government of Canada to aid you in passing a Bill through Parliament which clearly is for the benefit of Canada because it proposes to increase the efficiency of the railway service by a further outlay of capital and also to pay off debt a considerable part of which is incurred in Canada and secondly you ask for an immediate and just settlement of the charge for the conveyance by you of the mails

 From the votive offerings which have been found on the site it appears that she was conceived of especially as a huntress and further as blessing men and women with offspring and granting expectant mothers an easy delivery

 Further the title of Vesta borne by Diana at Nemi points clearly to the maintenance of a perpetual holy fire in her sanctuary

 Further at the annual festival of the goddess hunting dogs were crowned and wild beasts were not molested young people went through a purificatory ceremony in her honour wine was brought forth and the feast consisted of a kid cakes served piping hot on plates of leaves and apples still hanging in clusters on the boughs

 The real value of such tales is that they serve to illustrate the nature of the worship by providing a standard with which to compare it and further that they bear witness indirectly to its venerable age by showing that the true origin was lost in the mists of a fabulous antiquity

 Why should it not have obtained in ancient Latium Reviewing the evidence as a whole we may conclude that the worship of Diana in her sacred grove at Nemi was of great importance and immemorial antiquity that she was revered as the goddess of woodlands and of wild creatures probably also of domestic cattle and of the fruits of the earth that she was believed to bless men and women with offspring and to aid mothers in childbed that her holy fire tended by chaste virgins burned perpetually in a round temple within the precinct that associated with her was a water nymph Egeria who discharged one of Diana s own functions by succouring women in travail and who was popularly supposed to have mated with an old Roman king in the sacred grove further that Diana of the Wood herself had a male companion Virbius by name who was to her what Adonis was to Venus or Attis to Cybele and lastly that this mythical Virbius was represented in historical times by a line of priests known as Kings of the Wood who regularly perished by the swords of their successors and whose lives were in a manner bound up with a certain tree in the grove because so long as that tree was uninjured they were safe from attack

 Prayers promises or threats may secure him fine weather and an abundant crop from the gods and if a god should happen as he sometimes believes to become incarnate in his own person then he need appeal to no higher being he the savage possesses in himself all the powers necessary to further his own well being and that of his fellow men

 Further homoeopathic and in general sympathetic magic plays a great part in the measures taken by the rude hunter or fisherman to secure an abundant supply of food

 Further the warrior should be careful to avoid partaking of a cock that has died fighting or anything that has been speared to death and no male animal may on any account be killed in his house while he is away at the wars

 Further the Malagasy soldier must eschew kidneys because in the Malagasy language the word for kidney is the same as that for shot so shot he would certainly be if he ate a kidney

 Further the wives dare not touch a comb while their husbands are away collecting the camphor for if they did so the interstices between the fibres of the tree instead of being filled with the precious crystals would be empty like the spaces between the teeth of a comb

 Further they may not cover up their faces or the men would not to be able to find their way through the tall grass or jungle

 Further animals are often conceived to possess qualities of properties which might be useful to man and homoeopathic or imitative magic seeks to communicate these properties to human beings in various ways

 Further the garments are made by preference in a year which has an intercalary month for to the Chinese mind it seems plain that grave clothes made in a year which is unusually long will possess the capacity of prolonging life in an unusually high degree

 By filling up two wells which represented the eyes of the tortoise they at once blinded that disreputable animal and rendered him incapable of doing further mischief

 Further the sympathetic connexion supposed to exist between a person and his afterbirth or navel string comes out very clearly in the widespread custom of treating the afterbirth or navel string in ways which are supposed to influence for life the character and career of the person making him if it is a man a nimble climber a strong swimmer a skilful hunter or a brave soldier and making her if it is a woman a cunning sempstress a good baker and so forth

 Further they keep the bow near the fire to make the wound which it has inflicted hot and for the same reason they put the arrow head if it has been recovered into the fire

 The train of reasoning which thus commends itself to English and German rustics in common with the savages of Melanesia and America is carried a step further by the aborigines of Central Australia who conceive that under certain circumstances the near relations of a wounded man must grease themselves restrict their diet and regulate their behaviour in other ways in order to ensure his recovery

 Thompson Indians used to lay charms on the tracks of wounded deer after that they deemed it superfluous to pursue the animal any further that day for being thus charmed it could not travel far and would soon die

 Once your shrewd rogue has attained the height of his ambition and has no longer any selfish end to further he may and often does turn his talents his experience his resources to the service of the public

 And when we remember further that in another direction magic has paved the way for science we are forced to admit that if the black art has done much evil it has also been the source of much good that if it is the child of error it has yet been the mother of freedom and truth

 But whether the influences that make for further progress or those that threaten to undo what has already been accomplished will ultimately prevail whether the impulsive energy of the minority or the dead weight of the majority of mankind will prove the stronger force to carry us up to higher heights or to sink us into lower depths are questions rather for the sage the moralist and the statesman whose eagle vision scans the future than for the humble student of the present and the past

 Further I pointed out that the public magician occupies a position of great influence from which if he is a prudent and able man he may advance step by step to the rank of a chief or king

 Further they think that the wishes of twins are always fulfilled hence twins are feared because they can harm the man they hate

 Further the women must repair to the house of one of their gossips who has given birth to twins and must drench her with water which they carry in little pitchers

 Further their most important function is to take charge of the sacred storehouse usually a cleft in the rocks or a hole in the ground where are kept the holy stones and sticks churinga with which the souls of all the people both living and dead are apparently supposed to be in a manner bound up

 Further we have seen that over and above this general supernaturalism some persons are supposed to be inspired for short periods by a divine spirit and thus temporarily to enjoy the knowledge and power of the indwelling deity

 But often the veneration of the men went further and they worshipped women as true and living goddesses

 Immediately her husband prostrates himself and adores her she ceases to bear the humble title of wife and is called Lord domestic duties have no further claim on her and her will is a divine law

 Further in India every king is regarded as little short of a present god

 Further it appears that the royal priest is often a king not only in name but in fact swaying the sceptre as well as the crosier

 Further they are of opinion that certain trees are at all times inhabited by roving demons who if the trees were damaged would be set free to go about on errands of mischief

 In this version of the custom the powers of granting an easy delivery to women and of communicating vital energy to the sick and old are clearly ascribed to the willow while Green George the human double of the tree bestows food on the cattle and further ensures the favour of the water spirits by putting them in indirect communication with the tree

 Further the parents go through the country performing dances in the gardens of favoured friends apparently for the purpose of causing the plantain trees to bear fruit more abundantly

 Further he not only mimicked the oak god by wearing an oak wreath and other insignia of divinity but he was married to an oak nymph Egeria who appears to have been merely a local form of Diana in her character of a goddess of woods of waters and of child birth

 Further if I am right in supposing that in ancient Latium the royal families kept their daughters at home and sent forth their sons to marry princesses and reign among their wives people it will follow that the male descendants would reign in successive generations over different kingdoms

 Further spots which had been struck by lightning were regularly fenced in by the Greeks and consecrated to Zeus the Descender that is to the god who came down in the flash from heaven

 Further from the cross bar hangs a small log which serves the useful purpose of knocking on the head any evil spirit who might attempt to pass through the gateway

 Further as the oak god was also a god of the sky the thunder and the rain so his human representative would be required like many other divine kings to cause the clouds to gather the thunder to peal and the rain to descend in due season that the fields and orchards might bear fruit and the pastures be covered with luxuriant herbage

 Further the holy milkman never cuts his hair or pares his nails so long as he holds office he never crosses a river by a bridge but wades through a ford and only certain fords if a death occurs in his clan he may not attend any of the funeral ceremonies unless he first resigns his office and descends from the exalted rank of milkman to that of a mere common mortal

 Further on returning from the grave each Karen provides himself with three little hooks made of branches of trees and calling his spirit to follow him at short intervals as he returns he makes a motion as if hooking it and then thrusts the hook into the ground

 Further we can now explain the widespread custom of covering up mirrors or turning them to the wall after a death has taken place in the house

 Further if any one else touched the child at this period he was subjected to the same restrictions as the mother until the ceremony of her purification had been performed

 Further we medicine men summon the women of the country we tell them to prepare a ball of the earth which contains the blood

 These cairns of sacred stones he further learned were simply a precaution against witchcraft for if a man were not thus careful in disposing of his hair some of it might fall into the hands of his enemies who would by means of it be able to cast spells over him and so compass his destruction

 The Caffres carry still further this dread of allowing any portion of themselves to fall into the hands of an enemy for not only do they bury their cut hair and nails in a secret spot but when one of them cleans the head of another he preserves the vermin which he catches carefully delivering them to the person to whom they originally appertained supposing according to their theory that as they derived their support from the blood of the man from whom they were taken should they be killed by another the blood of his neighbour would be in his possession thus placing in his hands the power of some superhuman influence

 Further a Caffre wife is forbidden to pronounce even mentally the names of her father in law and of all her husband s male relations in the ascending line and whenever the emphatic syllable of any of their names occurs in another word she must avoid it by substituting either an entirely new word or at least another syllable in its place

 Among the Alfoors of Minahassa in Celebes the custom is carried still further so as to forbid the use even of words which merely resemble the personal names in sound

 Further when the name of the deceased happens to be that of some common object such as an animal or plant or fire or water it is sometimes considered necessary to drop that word in ordinary speech and replace it by another

 Gatschet possess no historic traditions going further back in time than a century for the simple reason that there was a strict law prohibiting the mention of the person or acts of a deceased individual by using his name

 Further words in the common language which bear any resemblance to the forbidden name also become sacred and have to be replaced by others

 Hence regarding their kings as incarnate divinities on whom the welfare of men of cattle and of the corn implicitly depends the Shilluk naturally pay them the greatest respect and take every care of them and however strange it may seem to us their custom of putting the divine king to death as soon as he shows signs of ill health or failing strength springs directly from their profound veneration for him and from their anxiety to preserve him or rather the divine spirit by which he is animated in the most perfect state of efficiency nay we may go further and say that their practice of regicide is the best proof they can give of the high regard in which they hold their kings

 Further every precaution is taken to prevent a rain maker from dying an accidental death for such an end though not nearly so serious a matter as death from illness or old age would be sure to entail sickness on the tribe

 Further it would appear that in remote times though not within the historical period the kings of Babylon or their barbarous predecessors forfeited not merely their crown but their life at the end of a year s tenure of office

 Temporary Kings IN SOME places the modified form of the old custom of regicide which appears to have prevailed at Babylon has been further softened down

 Further they give him a long artificial neck with an artificial head and a false face on the top of it

 This was done to ensure a fruitful and prosperous year further it was considered a safeguard against pestilence and sudden death

 Further in Lusatia and Silesia the puppet is sometimes made to look in at the window of a house and it is believed that some one in the house will die within the year unless his life is redeemed by the payment of money

 Further they may now bathe with impunity out of doors

 Further the Summer trees are adorned like May trees with ribbons and so on like May trees when large they are planted in the ground and climbed up and like May trees when small they are carried from door to door by boys or girls singing songs and collecting money

 If we survey the whole of the evidence on this subject some of which has still to be laid before the reader we may conclude that a great Mother Goddess the personification of all the reproductive energies of nature was worshipped under different names but with a substantial similarity of myth and ritual by many peoples of Western Asia that associated with her was a lover or rather series of lovers divine yet mortal with whom she mated year by year their commerce being deemed essential to the propagation of animals and plants each in their several kind and further that the fabulous union of the divine pair was simulated and as it were multiplied on earth by the real though temporary union of the human sexes at the sanctuary of the goddess for the sake of thereby ensuring the fruitfulness of the ground and the increase of man and beast

 Further these stories of the love of Aphrodite for two members of the royal house of Paphos can hardly be dissociated from the corresponding legend told of Pygmalion a Phoenician king of Cyprus who is said to have fallen in love with an image of Aphrodite and taken it to his bed

 Further it deserves to be noted that the names Pygmalion and Astarte occur together in a Punic inscription on a gold medallion which was found in a grave at Carthage the characters of the inscription are of the earliest type

 Further the hypothesis is confirmed by the practice of the Egyptian reapers who lamented calling upon Isis when they cut the first corn and it is recommended by the analogous customs of many hunting tribes who testify great respect for the animals which they kill and eat

 Further there is evidence which goes to show that among the agricultural peoples of the Eastern Mediterranean the corn spirit by whatever name he was known was often represented year by year by human victims slain on the harvest field

 A further step was taken by the Emperor Claudius when he incorporated the Phrygian worship of the sacred tree and with it probably the orgiastic rites of Attis in the established religion of Rome

 Further we may conjecture though we are not expressly told that it was on the same Day of Blood and for the same purpose that the novices sacrificed their virility

 Further pine cones were regarded as symbols or rather instruments of fertility

 Further the Cherokee precaution of leaving a clear path from the field to the house resembles the Egyptian invitation to Osiris Come to thy house

 Further the story that his mangled remains were scattered up and down the land and buried in different places may be a mythical way of expressing either the sowing or the winnowing of the grain

 Further we read of a Norwegian king Halfdan the Black whose body was cut up and buried in different parts of his kingdom for the sake of ensuring the fruitfulness of the earth

 A further detail is added by Augustine

 Further at harvest time when the Egyptian reapers had cut the first stalks they laid them down and beat their breasts wailing and calling upon Isis

 Further there are indications few but significant that Dionysus was conceived as a deity of agriculture and the corn

 Further we are told that in the land of the Bisaltae a Thracian tribe there was a great and fair sanctuary of Dionysus where at his festival a bright light shone forth at night as a token of an abundant harvest vouchsafed by the diety but if the crops were to fail that year the mystic light was not seen darkness brooded over the sanctuary as at other times

 The custom of killing a god in animal form which we shall examine more in detail further on belongs to a very early stage of human culture and is apt in later times to be misunderstood

 Further the Corn mother plays an important part in harvest customs

 Sometimes for further distinction a necklace of rice straw is tied round the female sheaf

 Further young women came and put dried flesh into the mouths of the old women for which they received in return a grain of the consecrated maize to eat

 Further we have seen that among the Malays of the Peninsula and sometimes among the Highlanders of Scotland the spirit of the grain is represented in double female form both as old and young by means of ears taken alike from the ripe crop in Scotland the old spirit of the corn appears as the Carline or Cailleach the young spirit as the Maiden while among the Malays of the Peninsula the two spirits of the rice are definitely related to each other as mother and child

 Moreover he is quizzed and teased in all sorts of ways till he frees himself from further annoyance by treating the others to brandy or beer

 Further the same identification is implied in the savage custom of killing the representative of the corn spirit with hoes or spades or by grinding him between stones and in the European custom of pretending to kill him with the scythe or the flail

 Further both the Lityerses story and European harvest customs agree in indicating that the victim was put to death as a representative of the corn spirit and this indication is in harmony with the view which some savages appear to take of the victim slain to make the crops flourish

 But further the Linus song was probably sung also by Phoenician reapers for Herodotus compares it to the Maneros song which as we have seen was a lament raised by Egyptian reapers over the cut corn

 Further Linus was identified with Adonis and Adonis has some claims to be regarded as especially a corn deity

 The Corn spirit as a Goat FURTHER the corn spirit often appears in the form of a goat

 Further the corn spirit under the form of a goat is sometimes conceived as lurking among the cut corn in the barn till he is driven from it by the threshing flail

 Further the corn spirit captured in the form of a goat at threshing is passed on to a neighbour whose threshing is not yet finished

 Further the corn spirit in bull form is sometimes believed to be killed at threshing

 Further the Fauns the Italian counterpart of the Greek Pans and Satyrs are described as being half goats with goat feet and goat horns

 The Fauns are expressly designated as woodland deities and their character as such is still further brought out by their association or even identification with Silvanus and the Silvanuses who as their name of itself indicates are spirits of the woods

 Further it is to be noted that at the Thesmophoria the women appear to have eaten swine s flesh

 Further it appears that the blood of the horse was caught and preserved till the twenty first of April when the Vestal Virgins mixed it with the blood of the unborn calves which had been sacrificed six days before

 But further as might have been anticipated the new corn is itself eaten sacramentally that is as the body of the corn spirit

 But further we have found a widespread custom of eating the god sacramentally either in the shape of the man or animal who represents the god or in the shape of bread made in human or animal form

 Batchelor who tells us that the Aino are firmly convinced that the spirits of birds and animals killed in hunting or offered in sacrifice come and live again upon the earth clothed with a body and they believe further that they appear here for the special benefit of men particularly Ainu hunters

 Then the hunter naked stepped into the hollow of the ribs and kneeling down in the bloody pool washed his whole body with the blood and excretions of the animal while he prayed to the soul of the hippopotamus not to bear him a grudge for having killed her and so blighted her hopes of future maternity and he further entreated the ghost not to stir up other hippopotamuses to avenge her death by butting at and capsizing his canoe

 At every bunch of feathers the ghost stops to consider Is this the whole of my body or only a part of it The doubt gives him pause and when at last he has made up his mind fully at all the bunches and has further wasted valuable time by the zigzag course which he invariably pursues in going from one to another the hunters are safe at home and the bilked ghost may stalk in vain round about the village which he is too timid to enter

 If a family is in any great trouble through illness or bereavement their friends and neighbours come together and a lamb is killed this is thought to avert further evil

 When the ceremony takes place at harvest time the elation of feeling which it excites is further stimulated by the state of physical wellbeing produced by an abundant supply of food

 Paton further supposes that the loves of the trees may on the same principle of imitative magic have been simulated by a mock or even a real marriage between the two human victims one of whom appears sometimes to have been a woman

 Further that it was above all intended to fertilise the fig trees is strongly suggested by the strings of black and white figs which were hung round the necks of the victims as well as by the blows which were given their genital organs with the branches of a wild fig tree since this procedure closely resembles the procedure which ancient and modern husbandmen in Greek lands have regularly resorted to for the purpose of actually fertilising their fig trees

 In other words the martyrologist s account of the Saturnalia agrees so closely with the accounts of similar rites elsewhere which could not possibly have been known to him that the substantial accuracy of his description may be regarded as established and further since the custom of putting a mock king to death as a representative of a god cannot have grown out of a practice of appointing him to preside over a holiday revel whereas the reverse may very well have happened we are justified in assuming that in an earlier and more barbarous age it was the universal practice in ancient Italy wherever the worship of Saturn prevailed to choose a man who played the part and enjoyed all the traditionary privileges of Saturn for a season and then died whether by his own or another s hand whether by the knife or the fire or on the gallows tree in the character of the good god who gave his life for the world

 Further her identification with the corn and the corn goddess was clearly announced by making her stand on the heaps of maize and there receive the homage and blood offerings of the whole people who thereby returned her thanks for the benefits which in her character of a divinity she was supposed to have conferred upon them

 Further she may not see the sky and woe betide her if she catches sight of a crow or a cat Her diet must be strictly vegetarian without salt tamarinds or chillies

 Some evidence of the fear and of the customs based on it has been cited in an earlier part of this work but as the terror for it is nothing less which the phenomenon periodically strikes into the mind of the savage has deeply influenced his life and institutions it may be well to illustrate the subject with some further examples

 Further the Baganda would not suffer a menstruous woman to visit a well if she did so they feared that the water would dry up and that she herself would fall sick and die unless she confessed her fault and the medicine man made atonement for her

 Further it was customary at W rzburg in the sixteenth century for the bishop s followers to throw burning discs of wood into the air from a mountain which overhangs the town

 Further it deserves to be remarked that in Sweden St

 Further the influence which these fires whether periodic or occasional are supposed to exert on the weather and vegetation may be cited in support of the view that they are sun charms since the effects ascribed to them resemble those of sunshine

 Further there are clear indications that even human fecundity is supposed to be promoted by the genial heat of the fires

 Further brands taken from the bonfires are commonly kept in the houses to guard them against conflagration and though this may perhaps be done on the principle of homoeopathic magic one fire being thought to act as a preventive of another it is also possible that the intention may be to keep witch incendiaries at bay

 Further both peoples thought that if the plant were to exert its medicinal properties it must be gathered in a certain way and at a certain time

 Further that oak wood was formerly the fuel burned in the midsummer fires may perhaps be inferred from the custom said to be still observed by peasants in many mountain districts of Germany of making up the cottage fire on Midsummer Day with a heavy block of oak wood

 The sage contrived to purloin the talisman while the khan and his guards slept but not content with this he gave a further proof of his dexterity by bonneting the slumbering potentate with a bladder

 To save her from further persecution her parents resolved to remove their daughter from the city

 Similarly among the Esquimaux of Alaska when a child is sick the medicine man will sometimes extract its soul from its body and place it for safe keeping in an amulet which for further security he deposits in his own medicine bag

 The External Soul in Plants FURTHER it has been shown that in folk tales the life of a person is sometimes so bound up with the life of a plant that the withering of the plant will immediately follow or be followed by the death of the person

 But further each Batak believes that he has seven or on a more moderate computation three souls

 Further it deserves to be noted that in three languages out of the four the same word which is applied to the bull roarer and to the monster means also a ghost or spirit of the dead while in the fourth language the Kai it signifies grandfather

 Further upon leaving the Kakian house the boys are strictly forbidden to eat of certain fruits until the next celebration of the rites has taken place

 The conjecture is confirmed by the observation that in Wales a real sprig of mistletoe gathered on Midsummer Eve is similarly placed under the pillow to induce prophetic dreams and further the mode of catching the imaginary bloom of the oak in a white cloth is exactly that which was employed by the Druids to catch the real mistletoe when it dropped from the bough of the oak severed by the golden sickle

 Further we can perhaps see why in antiquity mistletoe was believed to possess the remarkable property of extinguishing fire and why in Sweden it is still kept in houses as a safeguard against conflagration

 Perhaps the new theory has the further advantage of throwing light on the special sanctity ascribed to mistletoe which grows on an oak

 Who would believe this childish discipline received at eight years old from the hands of a woman of thirty should influence my propensities my desires my passions for the rest of my life and that in quite a contrary sense from what might naturally have been expected The very incident that inflamed my senses gave my desires such an extraordinary turn that confined to what I had already experienced I sought no further and with blood boiling with sensuality almost from my birth preserved my purity beyond the age when the coldest constitutions lose their insensibility long tormented without knowing by what I gazed on every handsome woman with delight imagination incessantly brought their charms to my remembrance only to transform them into so many Miss Lamberciers

 These prejudices of education proper in themselves to retard the first explosions of a combustible constitution were strengthened as I have already hinted by the effect the first moments of sensuality produced in me for notwithstanding the troublesome ebullition of my blood I was satisfied with the species of voluptuousness I had already been acquainted with and sought no further

 Once according to my praiseworthy custom of speaking without thought I replied I did not know which answer naturally made them conclude I was a fool but on questioning me further the examination turned out so far to my advantage that I rather rose in their opinion and I once heard Madam du Colombier say to her friend He is amiable but not sufficiently acquainted with the world

 We were both in a country and season of plenty and had everywhere excellent cheer thanks to the good cares of the marquis though I would willingly have relinquished this advantage to have been more satisfied with the situation of our chambers but he always sent his footman on to provide them and whether of his own accord or by the order of his master the rogue always took care that the marquis chamber should be close by Madam de Larnage s while mine was at the further end of the house but that made no great difference or perhaps it rendered our rendezvous the more charming this happiness lasted four or five days during which time I was intoxicated with delight which I tasted pure and serene without any alloy an advantage I could never boast before and I may add it is owing to Madam de Larnage that I did not go out of the world without having tasted real pleasure

 This mediocrity was mostly owing to my ardent yet feeble nature less prompt in undertaking than easy to discourage quitting repose for violent agitations but returning to it from lassitude and inclinations and which placing me in an idle and tranquil state for which alone I felt I was born at a distance from the paths of great virtues and still further from those of great vices never permitted me to arrive at anything great either good or bad

 The music also was so far sketched out that all I had further to do to it after my return from Paris was to compose a little of the recitative and to add the middle parts the whole of which I finished with so much rapidity that in three weeks my work was ready for representation

 Going one day with Madam D Epinay to see the building we continued our walk a quarter of a league further to the reservoir of the waters of the park which joined the forest of Montmorency and where there was a handsome kitchen garden with a little lodge much out of repair called the Hermitage

 In my strange and unparalleled situation I owe too much to truth to be further than this indebted to any person whatever

 I had thought this indirect manner of communicating these to my fellow citizens would be least mortifying to their pride and might obtain me forgiveness for having seen a little further than themselves

 Had this resolution gone no further than restoring me to myself all would have been well but unfortunately it rapidly carried me away to the other extreme

 Happily before I proceeded any further I perceived the hold I was about to give the government against me and I immediately withdrew

 I had made the first to run to poor Gauffecourt who had had a stroke of apoplexy from which he has never perfectly recovered I did not quit the side of his pillow until he was so far restored as to have no further need of my assistance

 The evening before he came I was dislodged from the chamber of favor contiguous to that of Madam d Epinay it was prepared for Grimm and instead of it I was put into another further off

 I have without going further than my own history a strong proof of this maxim in Grimm and in Tronchin both became my implacable enemies from inclination pleasure and fancy without having been able to charge me with having done either of them the most trifling injury I did not give the surname of Jongleur only to the latter until a long time after his enmity had been declared and the persecutions he brought upon me at Geneva and elsewhere

 Although trembling and almost blind with rage whilst I read this epistle I remarked the address with which Diderot affected a milder and more polite language than he had done in his former ones wherein he never went further than My dear without ever deigning to add the name of friend

 All further explanation would be useless

 For my part I never consult mine upon my duty and I have nothing further to say to you upon your own

 She could not make any further advances without exposing herself but after her former letters and my sudden retreat from her house it is impossible not to be struck with the care she takes in this letter not to suffer an offensive expression to escape her

 I resolved to break with Diderot forever and this without further deliberation except on the manner of doing it for I had perceived secret ruptures turned to my prejudice because they left the mask of friendship in possession of my most cruel enemies

 Further than this I defy any person with whom I was then acquainted to say I was ever dazzled for an instant with splendor or that the vapor of the incense I received ever affected my head that I was less uniform in my manner less plain in my dress less easy of access to people of the lowest rank less familiar with neighbors or less ready to render service to every person when I had it in my power so to do without ever once being discouraged by the numerous and frequently unreasonable importunities with which I was incessantly assailed

 If I go further it will be groping in the dark

 I expected all the productions together would produce me a net capital of from eight to ten thousand livres three to four hundred pounds which I intended to sink in annuities for my life and that of Theresa after which our design as I have already mentioned was to go and live together in the midst of some province without further troubling the public about me or myself with any other project than that of peacefully ending my days and still continuing to do in my neighborhood all the good in my power and to write at leisure the memoirs which I intended

 Emilius was at length given to the public without my having heard further of retrenchments or difficulties

 I easily imagined the academy and the premium to be newly founded the better to conceal the plagiarism from the eyes of the public but I further perceived there was some prior intrigue which I could not unravel either by the lending of my manuscript without which the theft could not have been committed or for the purpose of forging the story of the pretended premium to which it was necessary to give some foundation

 Ah let me breathe for a moment with this worthy host It is necessary I should gain strength and courage before I proceed further

 The further I advance in my narrative the less order I feel myself capable of observing

 They took me at my word and I concerned myself no more about their affairs further than constantly to exhort them to peace not doubting should they continue to be obstinate of their being crushed by France this however did not happen I know the reason why it did not but this is not the place to explain what I mean

 As I did not on this account hasten my pace my calmness increased their fury but they never went further than threats at least with respect to firearms

 I went further feeling that after all were he not culpable I had no right to call upon him for proofs of any kind I stated in a memoir of considerable length the reasons whence I had inferred my conclusion and determined to submit them to the judgment of an arbitrator against whom Vernes could not except

 This treaty and sending of troops gave me uneasiness and without imagining I had any further relation with the business I thought it impossible and the attempt ridiculous to labor at an undertaking which required such undisturbed tranquillity as the political institution of a people in the moment when perhaps they were upon the point of being subjugated

 The more I considered the proposed undertaking and the further I advanced in the examination of the papers I had in my hands the greater I found the necessity of studying in the country the people for whom institutions were to be made the soil they inhabited and all the relative circumstances by which it was necessary to appropriate to them that institution

 As it was her poor weak darlings were carried about from London to Brighton from Brighton to some German baths from the German baths back to Torquay and thence as regarded the four we have named to that bourne from whence no further journey could be made under Lady Arabella s directions

 I wish to goodness you had no further need to borrow

 Or perhaps there are four degrees humble umble stumble tumble and then when one is absolutely in the dirt at their feet perhaps these big people won t wish one to stoop any further

 The Honourable John was not perhaps as much accustomed to the ready use of his tongue as was his honourable brother seeing that it was not his annual business to depict the glories of the farmers daughters at any rate on this occasion he seemed to be at some loss for words he shut up as the slang phrase goes and made no further allusion to the necessity of supplying young Gresham with a proper stream of hunters

 She now pushed it further and said that no time should be lost that he should not only marry money but do so very early in life there was always a danger in delay

 It was at last decided that the countess should herself convey to Frank a special invitation to Courcy Castle and that when she got him there she should do all that lay in her power to prevent his return to Cambridge and to further the Dunstable marriage

 Mary asked no further question nor did the doctor volunteer further information

 If you say one word of Mary So far had he got in his injunction to his sister but further than that in such a case was he never destined to proceed

 I have settled all that with your mother so we need say nothing further about it

 One thing further must be told of Sir Roger

 Not only had he there to negotiate the squire s further loan but also to exercise his medical skill

 It was not worth the doctor s while to aver that the testiness had all been on the other side and that he had never lost his good humour so he merely smiled and asked Sir Roger if he could do anything further for him

 And who knows may be I may be settling your affairs yet eh doctor looking after your niece when you re dead and gone and getting a husband for her eh Ha ha ha And then without further speech the doctor went his way

 The doctor had been in the saddle all day and as Janet brought the note into the room Mary stood up as though to defend her uncle from any further invasion on his rest

 If he wants further accommodation he must part with his deeds doctor

 What do you mean by this Dr Thorne would say nothing further till he had got the man into bed again

 When he had finished he fixed his eyes upon the ground pointing downwards as if there was to be the site of his doom if the curse that he had called down upon himself should ever come to pass and then waiting no further converse he hobbled away melancholy to his deserted stables

 She got into conversation with the bishop and with some other people and except that he took her teacup and nearly managed to squeeze one of her fingers as she did so he made very little further progress till towards the close of the evening

 But purity was to be carried much further than this

 It wasn t so easy to tell these gentlemen anything new harnessed as he was at this moment so he looked back at his honourable supporter for some further hint

 As the insidious fluid trickled down beneath his waistcoat he felt that all further powers of coaxing the electors out of their votes by words flowing from his tongue sweeter than honey was for that occasion denied him

 Why make a good man miserable for such a trifle It became notified to Reddypalm with sufficient clearness that his bill for the past election should be paid without further question and therefore at five o clock the Mayor of Barchester proclaimed the results of the contests in the following figures Scatcherd Moffat Mr Reddypalm s two votes had decided the question

 A young man who had been so amenable to reason was worthy of further assistance and so Lady de Courcy did what she could to assist him

 Sincerely hoping that you may be perfectly successful in your proud ambition to shine in Parliament and regretting extremely that I cannot share that ambition with you I beg to subscribe myself with very great respect Your sincere well wisher MARTHA DUNSTABLE The Honourable George with that modesty which so well became him accepted Miss Dunstable s reply as a final answer to his little proposition and troubled her with no further courtship

 Of course the further induction to be shown was this that people so circumstanced should marry among themselves the Dunstables and the Moffats each with the other and not tumble into the pitfalls prepared for them

 Frank of course had nothing further to say but he already began to feel himself a little snubbed he thought that the duke duke though he was when he asked people to dinner should be there to tell them that he was glad to see them

 Now Mr Gresham said she before you go any further you shall listen to me

 If I have I will humbly beg your pardon said she but but but Frank had nothing further to say in his own defence

 Nothing further on the subject was said

 And then there was nothing further to be said on the matter

 He could not afford to look forward to what further favours parliamentary future have in store for him after a lapse of five or six years

 My undertaking goes no further than this that I will not be seen within their gates

 But from Berlin Sir Roger received a letter in which the tutor declined to go any further in the task which he had undertaken

 Sir Roger made no further attempt to give counsel to his son

 It might be that Beatrice would absolutely refuse to pay this respect to her mother s authority and then where would she have been At this moment a servant came up to say that the squire was in his room and Lady Arabella was opportunely saved the necessity of discussing the matter further with her daughter

 Oh I don t mind said Frank trying to laugh he won t bite I suppose The doctor longed in his heart to pray to Frank to return with him not to go and make further mischief not to do that which might cause a more bitter estrangement between himself and the squire

 How was he to make further progress To Mary also the same ideas no doubt occurred with many others

 Perhaps he had succeeded in negotiating a further loan thus temporarily sprinkling a drop of water over the ever rising dust of his difficulties

 No sir he continued after a further pause

 On the second she was more determined though less civil and then she told him that if he pressed her further he would drive her from her mother s house

 He had at first been decently submissive with the view of obtaining increased supplies of ready money but he had been sharp enough to perceive that let his conduct be what it would the doctor would keep him out of debt but that the doing so took so large a sum that he could not hope for any further advances

 Alas alas he had no further chance now of ever being all right again

 The doctor spoke strongly very strongly spoke of quick almost immediate death in case of further excesses spoke to him of the certainty there would be that he could not live to dispose of his own property if he could not refrain

 Frank she said and then stopped not being able at the moment to get any further

 Nothing further occurred in this interview which needs recording

 Joe had no written credentials for his master was hardly equal to writing and Lady Scatcherd had declined to put herself to further personal communication with Dr Fillgrave but he had effrontery enough to deliver any message

 If so our further talking will be worse than useless

 And so she made no further visit to the post office and the letter went on its way

 Yes you had better send it said the squire and then nothing further was said at the table

 And then Dr Fillgrave thinking that even the present circumstances required no further condescension ensconced himself in the carriage

 And now Frank Before we go on we must say one word further as to Lady Arabella s character

 To so much Frank consented after some further parley namely that he would proceed to London on the following Monday morning without again seeing Mary

 As the subject was matrimony it was his easiest course to begin about himself but never could he get any further

 Frank could draw nothing further from his friend save constant repetitions of this charge to him to wait a fortnight just one other fortnight

 He took up the article which he had come to seek and kissing her again on the forehead went away to his bed room without further speech

 After some further slight delay the doctor got up and did go upstairs

 Whether that discussion was to be for her good or ill she did not know but she felt that further suspense would almost kill her

 Yes yes yes Now that poor Sir Louis is dead Well uncle well It has been left To Frank to Mr Gresham to the squire exclaimed Mary who felt with an agony of doubt that this sudden accession of immense wealth might separate her still further from her lover

 I was grown deaf by the clanking of the chain of my mortality the punishment of the pride of my soul and I strayed further from Thee and Thou lettest me alone and I was tossed about and wasted and dissipated and I boiled over in my fornications and Thou heldest Thy peace O Thou my tardy joy Thou then heldest Thy peace and I wandered further and further from Thee into more and more fruitless seed plots of sorrows with a proud dejectedness and a restless weariness

 For that year were my studies intermitted whilst after my return from Madaura a neighbour city whither I had journeyed to learn grammar and rhetoric the expenses for a further journey to Carthage were being provided for me and that rather by the resolution than the means of my father who was but a poor freeman of Thagaste

 Woe is me and dare I say that Thou heldest Thy peace O my God while I wandered further from Thee Didst Thou then indeed hold Thy peace to me And whose but Thine were these words which by my mother Thy faithful one Thou sangest in my ears Nothing whereof sunk into my heart so as to do it

 Upon how grievous iniquities consumed I myself pursuing a sacrilegious curiosity that having forsaken Thee it might bring me to the treacherous abyss and the beguiling service of devils to whom I sacrificed my evil actions and in all these things Thou didst scourge me I dared even while Thy solemnities were celebrated within the walls of Thy Church to desire and to compass a business deserving death for its fruits for which Thou scourgedst me with grievous punishments though nothing to my fault O Thou my exceeding mercy my God my refuge from those terrible destroyers among whom I wandered with a stiff neck withdrawing further from Thee loving mine own ways and not Thine loving a vagrant liberty

 What did all this further me seeing it even hindered me when imagining whatever was was comprehended under those often Predicaments I essayed in such wise to understand O my God Thy wonderful and unchangeable Unity also as if Thou also hadst been subjected to Thine own greatness or beauty so that as in bodies they should exist in Thee as their subject whereas Thou Thyself art Thy greatness and beauty but a body is not great or fair in that it is a body seeing that though it were less great or fair it should notwithstanding be a body

 But what did this further me imagining that Thou O Lord God the Truth wert a vast and bright body and I a fragment of that body Perverseness too great But such was I

 For Thy Word the Eternal Truth far above the higher parts of Thy Creation raises up the subdued unto Itself but in this lower world built for Itself a lowly habitation of our clay whereby to abase from themselves such as would be subdued and bring them over to Himself allaying their swelling and tomenting their love to the end they might go on no further in self confidence but rather consent to become weak seeing before their feet the Divinity weak by taking our coats of skin and wearied might cast themselves down upon It and It rising might lift them up

 And what is like unto Thy Word our Lord who endureth in Himself without becoming old and maketh all things new We were saying then If to any the tumult of the flesh were hushed hushed the images of earth and waters and air hushed also the pole of heaven yea the very soul be hushed to herself and by not thinking on self surmount self hushed all dreams and imaginary revelations every tongue and every sign and whatsoever exists only in transition since if any could hear all these say We made not ourselves but He made us that abideth for ever If then having uttered this they too should be hushed having roused only our ears to Him who made them and He alone speak not by them but by Himself that we may hear His Word not through any tongue of flesh nor Angel s voice nor sound of thunder nor in the dark riddle of a similitude but might hear Whom in these things we love might hear His Very Self without these as we two now strained ourselves and in swift thought touched on that Eternal Wisdom which abideth over all could this be continued on and other visions of kind far unlike be withdrawn and this one ravish and absorb and wrap up its beholder amid these inward joys so that life might be for ever like that one moment of understanding which now we sighed after were not this Enter into thy Master s joy And when shall that be When we shall all rise again though we shall not all be changed Such things was I speaking and even if not in this very manner and these same words yet Lord Thou knowest that in that day when we were speaking of these things and this world with all its delights became as we spake contemptible to us my mother said Son for mine own part I have no further delight in any thing in this life

 For these he that hath in his knowledge seeks not further to attain unto but a happy life we have in our knowledge and therefore love it and yet still desire to attain it that we may be happy

 From Thee O Lord my God to whom I owe humble and single hearted service by what artifices and suggestions doth the enemy deal with me to desire some sign But I beseech Thee by our King and by our pure and holy country Jerusalem that as any consenting thereto is far from me so may it ever be further and further

 Permit me Lord to seek further

 But whence had it this degree of being but from Thee from Whom are all things so far forth as they are But so much the further from Thee as the unliker Thee for it is not farness of place

 In which words is the formlessness conveyed unto us that such capacities may hereby be drawn on by degrees as are not able to conceive an utter privation of all form without yet coming to nothing out of which another Heaven might be created together with a visible and well formed earth and the waters diversly ordered and whatsoever further is in the formation of the world recorded to have been not without days created and that as being of such nature that the successive changes of times may take place in them as being subject to appointed alterations of motions and of forms

 Their periods of contact ascertained in history or suggested by geographical considerations will prompt the further question to what extent each body of belief was evolved in independence of the others

 The great change from desert life consists in the adoption of agriculture and when once that was made by the Hebrews any further advance in economic development was dictated by their new surroundings

 Outside its enclosing wall to the south west a large triangular mound christened Tablet Hill by the excavators yielded a further supply of records

 At the same time the help of several Assyriologists was welcomed in the further task of running over and sorting the collections as they were prepared for study

 This at any rate proves that their advent was not sudden nor comparatively recent and it further suggests that Babylonia itself was the cradle of their civilization

 Further proof of this correspondence may be seen in the fact that the new Sumerian Version of the Deluge Story which I propose to discuss in the second lecture gives us a connected account of the world s history down to that point

 It is possible that Professor Barton has already fulfilled his promise of further discussion perhaps in his Archaeology and the Bible to the publication of which I have seen a reference in another connexion cf

 But the theory in the hands of its more enthusiastic adherents goes further than that

 For them a complete absence of astrological colouring is no deterrent from an astrological interpretation and where such colouring does occur the possibility of later embellishment is discounted and it is treated without further proof as the base on which the original story rests

 But more interesting still and an incentive to further exploration in that region is another of his discoveries last year also made near the Afghan border

 It would appear that a beginning had already been made in the establishment of the kingdom and before proceeding to his further work of founding the Antediluvian cities he follows the example of the speaker in the First Column of the text and lays down the divine enactments by which his purpose was accomplished

 But a further apparent difference has been noted

 A dream or possibly dreams such as had not been before appears to him and he seems to be further described as conjuring by the Name of Heaven and Earth but as the ends of all these lines are broken the exact connexion of the phrases is not quite certain

 On the rendering of this passage depends our interpretation of the whole of the Fourth Column where the point will be further discussed

 Meanwhile it may be noted that the conjuring by the Name of Heaven and Earth which we may assume is ascribed to Ziusudu gains in significance if we may regard the setting of the myth as a magical incantation an inference in support of which we shall note further evidence

 Before the text breaks off we again have a reference to the kingdom and its rule a further trace of the close association of the Deluge with the dynastic succession in the early traditions of Sumer

 Even so before starting on the work he took the further precautions of ascertaining that the omens were favourable and of purifying his city from all malign influence

 But his further description shows that he is here referred to the kelek or skin raft with which he has combined a description of the kuffah 

 In the Sumerian Version on the other hand Ziusudu regards himself as saved when he sees the Sun shining he needs no further tests to assure himself that the danger is over and his sacrifice too is one of gratitude for his escape

 and see further Meissner Orient

 Against the latter alternative it is to be noted that the god is addressing more than one person and further at Ziusudu is evidently already pardoned for so far from following the deity s advice he immediately prostrates himself before Anu and Enlil and receives immortality

 If once combined the further step of making the incantation the actual means by which Ziusudu achieved his own rescue and immortality would be a natural development

 In the third and eleventh lines of the column we have further references to the mysterious object the creation of which appears to have been recorded in the First Column of the text between man s creation and that of animals

 Should this suggestion prove to be correct the three passages mentioning the niggilma must be classed with those in which the invocation is referred to as ensuring the sanction of the myth to further elements in the magic

 But it is to be hoped that light will be thrown on this puzzling word by further study and perhaps by new fragments of the text meanwhile it would be hazardous to suggest a more definite rendering

 And this conclusion is further supported a by the occurrence throughout the text of the attested Sumerian equivalent of the Semitic word employed in the Babylonian Versions for the Flood or Deluge and b by the use of precisely the same term for the hero s great boat which is already familiar to us from an early Babylonian Version

 What evidence we may ask does this early Sumerian Version offer with regard to the origin and literary history of the Hebrew Versions The general dependence of the biblical Versions upon the Babylonian legend as a whole has long been recognized and needs no further demonstration and it has already been observed that the parallelisms with the version in the Gilgamesh Epic are on the whole more detailed and striking in the earlier than in the later Hebrew Version

 Our conclusion that the Sumerian form of the tradition did not die out leaves the question as to the periods during which Babylonian influence may have acted upon Hebrew tradition in great measure unaffected and we may therefore postpone its further consideration to the next lecture

 With regard to the theory itself we may confidently expect that further examples will be found in its illustration and support

 A further question arises as to whether some strands of the narrative may not at one time have existed in Sumerian form independently of the Creation myth

 A further version of the Dragon myth has now been identified on one of the tablets recovered during the recent excavations at Ashur and in it the dragon is not entirely of serpent form but is a true dragon with legs

 But the traces are not in favour of the restoration and the omission of Enlil s name from this part of the poem may be readily explained as a further tribute to Marduk who definitely usurps his place throughout the subsequent narrative

 Further evidence of this may be seen in the fact that Anu Enlil and Ea i

 From a study of some aspects of the names at the beginning of the Babylonian poem we have already seen reason to suspect that its version of the Birth of the Gods goes back to Sumerian times and it is pertinent to ask whether we have any further evidence that in Sumerian belief water was the origin of all things

 To the following couplet which describes Gilimma s method of creation is appended a further extract from a later portion of the text there evidently displaced giving additional details of the Creator s work Gilimma bound reeds in the face of the waters He formed soil and poured it out beside the reeds

 They profess also to have wrought cures by what they call Criticism of which I shall speak further on

 It is a principle with them to attempt nothing without the general consent of all the people and if there is objection made the matter proposed is put off for further discussion

 Charles had indeed still further taken up his cross as he had noticed with pleasure by going to sleep with the smaller children to take charge of them during the night

 When I mentioned to an acquaintance in Portland my purpose to spend some days at Aurora he replied Oh yes Dutchtown you ll feed better there than any where else in the state and on further inquiry I found that I might expect to see there also the best orchards in Oregon the most ingenious expedients for drying fruits and an excellent system of agriculture

 Beyond these practical points and the further statement that these Dutch are a queer people information about them is not general among Oregonians

 That however neither religion nor the harmony of nature teaches community in any thing further than property and labor

 Their further application I will show in detail hereafter

 Further I was told that tea coffee and sugar are roughly allowanced to each family

 I give below some further details which I elicited from Dr

 This result in a newly settled state and among a rude society will appear not less remarkable when I add that the community has no library that its members so far as I could see lack even the most common and moderate literary culture aspiring to nothing further than the ability to read write and cipher that from the president down it is absolutely without intellectual life

 Nineteen years of steady labor ought to have brought them I could not but think a little further ought to have given them tastefully ornamented grounds pretty houses a public bath a library and assembly room and neat Sunday clothing

 Keil cannot carry them further but he is sixty four years old if when he dies the presidency should fall into the hands of a person who with tact enough to keep the people together should have also intellectual culture enough to desire to lift them up to a higher plane of living I can see nothing to prevent his success

 The secretary further writes We have no constitution or bylaws ignore the idea of man s total depravity and believe that all who are actuated by a love of truth and a desire to progress and we will knowingly accept no others can be better governed by love and moral suasion than by any arbitrary laws

 Passing on further towards the Isthmus of Peloponnesus he slew Sinnis often surnamed the Bender of Pines after the same manner in which he himself had destroyed many others before

 It appears further that the passage of the Amazons through Thessaly was not without opposition for there are yet shown many tombs of them near Scotussa and Cynoscephalae

 And further he is accused of deserting Ariadne as is before related being in love with Aegle the daughter of Panopeus neither justly nor honorably and lastly of the rape of Helen which filled all Attica with war and blood and was in the end the occasion of his banishment and death as will presently be related

 He also joined Adrastus in recovering the bodies of those that were slain before Thebes but not as Euripides in his tragedy says by force of arms but by persuasion and mutual agreement and composition for so the greater part of the historians write Philochorus adds further that this was the first treaty that ever was made for the recovering the bodies of the dead but in the history of Hercules it is shown that it was he who first gave leave to his enemies to carry off their slain

 There were presently men in arms sent to pursue but they followed no further than to Tegea and Theseus and Pirithous being now out of danger having passed through Peloponnesus made an agreement between themselves that he to whom the lot should fall should have Helen to his wife but should be obliged to assist in procuring another for his friend

 Whilst he was thus busied in infecting the minds of the citizens the war that Castor and Pollux brought against Athens came very opportunely to further the sedition he had been promoting and some say that he by his persuasions was wholly the cause of their invading the city

 He therefore took and carried him home and being struck with admiration of the youth s person in stature and strength of body exceeding all men and perceiving in his very countenance the courage and force of his mind which stood unsubdued and unmoved by his present circumstances and hearing further that all the enterprises and actions of his life were answerable to what he saw of him but chiefly as it seemed a divine influence aiding and directing the first steps that were to lead to great results out of the mere thought of his mind and casually as it were he put his hand upon the fact and in gentle terms and with a kind aspect to inspire him with confidence and hope asked him who he was and whence he was derived

 By chance there was one among them who was at the exposing of the children and was one employed in the office he seeing the trough and knowing it by its make and inscription guessed at the business and without further delay telling the king of it brought in the man to be examined

 For indeed their prerogative being thus reduced within reasonable bounds the Spartan kings were at once freed from all further jealousies and consequent danger and never experienced the calamities of their neighbors at Messene and Argos who by maintaining their prerogative too strictly for want of yielding a little to the populace lost it all

 To offer an ox at the grave was not permitted nor to bury above three pieces of dress with the body or visit the tombs of any besides their own family unless at the very funeral most of which are likewise forbidden by our laws but this is further added in ours that those that are convicted of extravagance in their mournings are to be punished as soft and effeminate by the censors of women

 And as this absence of any supreme magistrate was leading to yet further confusion Camillus was the fourth time created dictator by the senate sorely against the people s will and not altogether in accordance with his own he had little desire for a conflict with men whose past services entitled them to tell him that he had achieved far greater actions in war along with them than in politics with the patricians who indeed had only put him forward now out of envy that if successful he might crush the people or failing be crushed himself

 In the meantime also the city Potidaea under the dominion of the Athenians but a colony formerly of the Corinthians had revolted and was beset with a formal siege and was a further occasion of precipitating the war

 About the same time Aspasia was indicted of impiety upon the complaint of Hermippus the comedian who also laid further to her charge that she received into her house freeborn women for the uses of Pericles

 To say the truth when Fabius first opposed this project of Scipio he probably did it out of caution and prudence in consideration only of the public safety and of the danger which the commonwealth might incur but when he found Scipio every day increasing in the esteem of the people rivalry and ambition led him further and made him violent and personal in his opposition

 And the people were in some degree startled with these declamations and were brought to believe that the further off Hannibal was the nearer was their danger

 This made all men of understanding cry out upon the thing but the people were as eager as ever to receive further accusations nor was their first heat at all abated but they instantly seized and imprisoned every one that was accused

 The Spartans giving him the security he desired he went eagerly was well received and at his very first coming succeeded in inducing them without any further caution or delay to send aid to the Syracusans and so roused and excited them that they forthwith dispatched Gylippus into Sicily to crush the forces which the Athenians had in Sicily

 He sailed off with all expedition in order to perform this and the ships which had already been seen as near as Aspendus were not brought any further by Tisaphernes who thus deceived the Lacedaemonians and it was by both sides believed that they had been diverted by the procurement of Alcibiades

 In the next place whereas they had engaged to prosecute Marcius upon no other head but that of tyranny which could never be made out against him they relinquished this plea and urged instead his language in the senate against an abatement of the price of corn and for the overthrow of the tribunician power adding further as a new impeachment the distribution that was made by him of the spoil and booty he had taken from the Antiates when he overran their country which he had divided among those that had followed him whereas it ought rather to have been brought into the public treasury which last accusation did they say more discompose Marcius than all the rest as he had not anticipated he should ever be questioned on that subject and therefore was less provided with any satisfactory answer to it on the sudden

 But if you decline to make any further attempts I am neither desirous to live myself nor will it be well in you to preserve a person who has been your rival and adversary of old and now when he offers you his service appears unprofitable and useless to you

 Several of the attendants on which were indeed scandalized at the sight yet no one of them interfered or acted further in the matter than merely to utter some common reproaches and execrations on a master who inflicted so cruel a punishment

 This resolution of theirs being made public the people could proceed no further having no authority to pass anything by suffrage and enact it for a law without a previous decree from the senate

 The reply of Marcius was that he should make no answer to this as general of the Volscians but in the quality still of a Roman citizen he would advise and exhort them as the case stood not to carry it so high but think rather of just compliance and return to him before three days were at an end with a ratification of his previous demands otherwise they must understand that they could not have any further freedom of passing through his camp upon idle errands

 For these reasons the conspirators judged it prudent not to make any further delays nor to test the general feeling but the boldest of their faction crying out that they ought not to listen to a traitor nor allow him still to retain office and play the tyrant among them fell upon Marcius in a body and slew him there none of those that were present offering to defend him

 The thing is further evident from the reply he once made to a stranger in Corinth who deriding him in a rude and scornful manner about the conferences he used to have with philosophers whose company had been one of his pleasures while yet a monarch and demanding in fine what he was the better now for all those wise and learned discourses of Plato Do you think said he I have made no profit of his philosophy when you see me bear my change of fortune as I do And when Aristoxenus the musician and several others desired to know how Plato offended him and what had been the ground of his displeasure with him he made answer that of the many evils attaching to the condition of sovereignty the one greatest infelicity was that none of those who were accounted friends would venture to speak freely or tell the plain truth and that by means of such he had been deprived of Plato s kindness

 When his soldiers quickly gave an echo to it all besought him to lead them on without any further delay he made a sign to the horse that they should draw off from the front where the chariots were and pass sidewards to attack their enemies in the flank then making his vanguard firm by joining man to man and buckler to buckler he caused the trumpet to sound and so bore in upon the Carthaginians

 Agrigentum and Gela two famous cities that had been ruined and laid waste by the Carthaginians after the Attic war were then peopled again the one by Megellus and Pheristus from Elea the other by Gorgus from the island of Ceos partly with new settlers partly with the old inhabitants whom they collected again from various parts to all of whom Timoleon not only afforded a secure and peaceable abode after so obstinate a war but was further so zealous in assisting and providing for them that he was honored among them as their founder

 Athanis the historian tells us that even during the war against Hippo and Mamercus while he was in his camp at Mylae there appeared a white speck within his eye from whence all could foresee the deprivation that was coming on him this however did not hinder him then from continuing the siege and prosecuting the war till he got both the tyrants into his power but upon his coming back to Syracuse he presently resigned the authority of sole commander and besought the citizens to excuse him from any further service since things were already brought to so fair an issue

 They occupy the further parts of Italy ending under the Alps and those parts of the Alps themselves which are washed by the Tuscan sea and face towards Africa mingled there with Gauls and Iberians of the coast

 Further he ordered that the sentinels by night should watch without javelins that thus they might be more careful and surer to resist sleep having no arms to defend themselves against any attacks of an enemy

 When Servius Galba who was Aemilius s enemy though he commanded as tribune under him understood this he had the boldness plainly to affirm that a triumph was not to be allowed him and sowed various calumnies amongst the soldiers which yet further increased their ill will

 As there was no witness of the fact the senate thought fit to call the youth himself before them on witnessing whose blushes and tears and shame mixed with the highest indignation seeking no further evidence of the crime they condemned Capitolinus and set a fine upon him of the money of which Marcellus caused silver vessels for libation to be made which he dedicated to the gods

 Marcellus could not be induced to put to death a man of such eminence and who had endured such dangers in fighting on the Roman side but knowing himself able by the general kindliness of his disposition and in particular by the attractiveness of his address to gain over a character whose passion was for honor one day when Bantius saluted him he asked him who he was not that he knew him not before but seeking an occasion of further conference

 We shall have it seems perpetually to fight with him as in good success his confidence and in ill success his shame still urges him to some further enterprise Then the armies engaged

 But some of the Numidians setting upon those that were carrying the urn took it from them by force and cast away the bones which being told to Hannibal It is impossible it seems then he said to do anything against the will of God He punished the Numidians but took no further care of sending or recollecting the bones conceiving that Marcellus so fell and so lay unburied by a certain fate

 Yet certainly in my judgment it marks an over rigid temper for a man to take the work out of his servants as out of brute beasts turning them off and selling them in their old age and thinking there ought to be no further commerce between man and man than whilst there arises some profit by it

 The senate voting their return it seems that a few days after Polybius s friends further wished that it should be moved in the senate that the said banished persons should receive again the honors which they first had in Achaea and to this purpose they sounded Cato for his opinion but he smiling answered that Polybius Ulysses like having escaped out of the Cyclops den wanted it would seem to go back again because he had left his cap and belt behind him

 There they put up marks upon some conspicuous peaks which surmount the hill called Callidromon and returning again they led the army along with them to the said marks till they got into their little path again and there once made a halt but when they began to go further the path deserted them at a precipice where they were in another strait and fear nor did they perceive that they were all this while near the enemy

 He was also a good father an excellent husband to his wife and an extraordinary economist and as he did not manage his affairs of this kind carelessly and as things of little moment I think I ought to record a little further whatever was commendable in him in these points

 Then to encourage the king s army further to bring them all upon the enemy while he was in confusion he quitted his horse and fighting with extreme difficulty in his heavy horseman s dress in rough uneven ground full of watercourses and hollows had both his thighs struck through with a thonged javelin

 The whole assembly rose and stood up there was no further thought of the entertainment all were only eager to leap up and salute and address their thanks to the deliverer and champion of Greece

 And what really happened afterwards does to a certain extent tend yet further to the exculpation of Titus

 And now as we find no further mention in history of anything done by Titus either in war or in the administration of the government but simply that he died in peace it is time to look upon him as he stands in comparison with Philopoemen

 When Demetrius received intelligence of this and perceived likewise the Macedonians ready to mutiny in the army he was afraid to advance further lest coming near Lysimachus a Macedonian king and of great fame they should revolt to him

 This was for the present useful and prevented a war but shortly after they found the partition not so much a peaceful settlement as an occasion of further complaint and difference

 You speak said Cineas what is perfectly probable but will the possession of Sicily put an end to the war God grant us answered Pyrrhus victory and success in that and we will use these as forerunners of greater things who could forbear from Libya and Carthage then within reach which Agathocles even when forced to fly from Syracuse and passing the sea only with a few ships had all but surprised These conquests once perfected will any assert that of the enemies who now pretend to despise us anyone will dare to make further resistance None replied Cineas for then it is manifest we may with such mighty forces regain Macedon and make all absolute conquest of Greece and when all these are in our power what shall we do then Said Pyrrhus smiling we will live at our ease my dear friend and drink all day and divert ourselves with pleasant conversation

 And Cineas discoursing with the senate in the most persuasive and obliging manner in the world yet was not heard with kindness or inclination although Pyrrhus offered also to return all the prisoners he had taken in the fight without ransom and promised his assistance for the entire conquest of all Italy asking only their friendship for himself and security for the Tarentines and nothing further

 Upon Fabricius s refusal he pressed him no further but the next day having a mind to discompose him as he had never seen an elephant before he commanded one of the largest completely armed to be placed behind the hangings as they were talking together

 After this Fabricius taking the consulate a person came with a letter to the camp written by the king s principal physician offering to take off Pyrrhus by poison and so end the war without further hazard to the Romans if he might have a reward proportionable to his service

 But this will further appear by and by from the facts

 In his praetorship he did not get much honor yet after it he obtained the further Spain which province he is said to have cleared of robbers with which it was much infested the old barbarous habits still prevailing and the Spaniards in those days still regarding robbery as a piece of valor

 Finding himself in a great straight especially because those that attended him were not able to go further being spent with their long fasting for the present he turned aside out of the road and hid himself in a thick wood where he passed the night in great wretchedness

 Such is the conduct recorded of him in the business about Miletus for when his friends and connections whom he had promised to assist in suppressing popular government and expelling their political opponents had altered their minds and were reconciled to their enemies he pretended openly as if he was pleased with it and was desirous to further the reconciliation but privately he railed at and abused them and provoked them to set upon the multitude

 Basillus made his way successfully into the city but the unarmed multitude pelting him with stones and tiles from off the houses stopped his further progress and beat him back to the wall

 When Archelaus opened the conversation and began to urge Sylla to abandon his pretensions to Asia and Pontus and to set sail for the war in Rome receiving money and shipping and such forces as he should think fitting from the king Sylla interposing bade Archelaus take no further care for Mithridates but assume the crown to himself and become a confederate of Rome delivering up the navy

 Upon this being yet further animated they joined battle and victoriously slaying eight thousand men took the camp

 He declares moreover that in vision he had seen his son who had died not long before Metella stand by in mourning attire and beseech his father to cast off further care and come along with him to his mother Metella there to live at ease and quietness with her

 As regards the pursuit of riches and pleasures we yet further discover in one a princely in the other a tyrannical disposition

 And further perceiving that Pausanias was carrying on secret communications with the barbarians and writing letters to the king of Persia to betray Greece and puffed up with authority and success was treating the allies haughtily and committing many wanton injustices Cimon taking this advantage by acts of kindness to those who were suffering wrong and by his general humane bearing robbed him of the command of the Greeks before he was aware not by arms but by his mere language and character

 One seemed to come to him in his sleep and say Go on a little further Lucullus for Autolycus is coming to see thee

 Wherefore hastening his march and passing the Tigris he came over into Armenia The first messenger that gave notice of Lucullus s coming was so far from pleasing Tigranes that he had his head cut off for his pains and no man daring to bring further information without any intelligence at all Tigranes sat while war was already blazing around him giving ear only to those who flattered him by saying that Lucullus would show himself a great commander if he ventured to wait for Tigranes at Ephesus and did not at once fly out of Asia at the mere sight of the many thousands that were come against him

 This is what we are told was said by Lucius Quintius one of the praetors at whose instance in particular the people determined to send one who should succeed Lucullus in his province and voted also to relieve many of the soldiers under him from further service

 Cleon at the first tried to draw back disconcerted at the proposal which he had never expected but the Athenians insisting and Nicias loudly upbraiding him he thus provoked and fired with ambition took upon him the charge and said further that within twenty days after he embarked he would either kill the enemy upon the place or bring them alive to Athens

 Nor was he content with this victory there but pushed on further till he met the Boeotians

 It grieved Nicias to hear of flight and departing home not that he did not fear the Syracusans but he was worse afraid of the Athenians their impeachments and sentences he professed that he apprehended no further harm there or if it must be he would rather die by the hand of an enemy than by his fellow citizens

 And Demosthenes his former counsel having succeeded so ill ceased to press him further others thought Nicias had reasons for expectation and relied on some assurance from people within the city and that this made him so strongly oppose their retreat so they acquiesced

 Vibius was well pleased at his escape and inquiring the place of his abode and the number of his companions he went not to him himself but commanded his steward to provide every day a good meal s meat and carry it and leave it near such a rock and so return without taking any further notice or being inquisitive promising him his liberty if he did as he commanded and that he would kill him if he intermeddled

 When the senate understood this they were displeased at the consuls and ordering them to meddle no further they appointed Crassus general of the war and a great many of the nobility went volunteers with him partly out of friendship and partly to get honor

 All which Spartacus at first slighted and despised but when provisions began to fail and on his proposing to pass further he found he was walled in and no more was to be had in the peninsula taking the opportunity of a snowy stormy night he filled up part of the ditch with earth and boughs of trees and so passed the third part of his army over

 All which when the soldiers heard their hearts failed them for till now they thought there was no difference between the Parthians and the Armenians or Cappadocians whom Lucullus grew weary with plundering and had been persuaded that the main difficulty of the war consisted only in the tediousness of the march and the trouble of chasing men that durst not come to blows so that the danger of a battle was beyond their expectation accordingly some of the officers advised Crassus to proceed no further at present but reconsider the whole enterprise amongst whom in particular was Cassius the quaestor

 Cassius and his friends began again to complain but when they perceived that it merely displeased Crassus they gave over but privately railed at the barbarian What evil genius O thou worst of men brought thee to our camp and with what charms and potions hast thou bewitched Crassus that he should march his army through a vast and deep desert through ways which are rather fit for a captain of Arabian robbers than for the general of a Roman army But the barbarian being a wily fellow very submissively exhorted them and encouraged them to sustain it a little further and ran about the camp and professing to cheer up the soldiers asked them jokingly What do you think you march through Campania expecting everywhere to find springs and shady trees and baths and inns of entertainment Consider you now travel through the confines of Arabia and Assyria

 Soon after a false report was brought to Surena that Crassus with his principal officers had escaped and that those who were got into Carrhae were but a confused rout of insignificant people not worth further pursuit

 The Parthians then to be sure had punctual intelligence of all that passed but it being contrary to their usage and also difficult for them to fight by night and Crassus having chosen that time to set out Andromachus lest he should get the start too far of his pursuers led him hither and thither and at last conveyed him into the midst of morasses and places full of ditches so that the Romans had a troublesome and perplexing journey of it and some there were who supposing by these windings and turnings of Andromachus that no good was intended resolved to follow him no further

 And so to these instances let us further add that the most warlike commanders and most remarkable for exploits of skillful stratagem have had but one eye as Philip Antigonus Hannibal and Sertorius whose life and actions we describe at present of whom indeed we might truly say that he was more continent than Philip more faithful to his friend than Antigonus and more merciful to his enemies than Hannibal and that for prudence and judgment he gave place to none of them but in fortune was inferior to them all

 And Sertorius made ready to fight him by sea although his ships were not built for strength but for lightness and swift sailing but a violent west wind raised such a sea that many of them were run aground and shipwrecked and he himself with a few vessels being kept from putting further out to sea by the fury of the weather and from landing by the power of his enemies was tossed about painfully for ten days together amidst the boisterous and adverse waves

 He added also further contrivances

 But finding there was no way to come at it as he rode about threatening them in vain and disconcerted he took notice that the wind raised the dust and carried it up towards the caves of the Characitanians the mouths of which as I said before opened towards the north and the northerly wind which some call Caecias prevailing most in those parts coming up out of moist plains or mountains covered with snow at this particular time in the heat of summer being further supplied and increased by the melting of the ice in the northern regions blew a delightful fresh gale cooling and refreshing the Characitanians and their cattle all the day long

 His negotiations with king Mithridates further argue the greatness of his mind

 What evil genius he would say hurries us perpetually from worse to worse We who disdained to obey the dictates of Sylla the ruler of sea and land and thus to live at home in peace and quiet are come hither to our destruction hoping to enjoy our liberty and have made ourselves slaves of our own accord and are become the contemptible guards and attendants of the banished Sertorius who that he may expose us the further gives us name that renders us ridiculous to all that hear it and calls us the Senate when at the same time he makes us undergo as much hard labor and forces us to be as subject to his haughty commands and insolences as any Spaniards and Lusitanians

 For he put all Sertorius s writings and letters together and read not one of them nor suffered anyone else to read them but burnt them all and caused Perpenna immediately to be put to death lest by discovering their names further troubles and revolutions might ensue

 But Perdiccas believing he was able enough to attain his own further objects without assistance and that the country he left behind him might stand in need of an active and faithful governor when he came into Cilicia dismissed Eumenes under color of sending him to his command but in truth to secure Armenia which was on its frontier and was unsettled through the practices of Neoptolemus

 And he was further emboldened when he understood that the enemy s pass word was Minerva and Alexander

 He made answer he would not only restore it to the Argyraspids but serve them further in other things if they would but deliver up Eumenes

 Agesilaus took this very ill and without further sacrifice immediately sailed away highly displeased with the Boeotians and much discouraged in his mind at the omen boding to himself an unsuccessful voyage and an imperfect issue of the whole expedition

 Many parts of Asia now revolting from the Persians Agesilaus restored order in the cities and without bloodshed or banishment of any of their members reestablished the proper constitution in the governments and now resolved to carry away the war from the seaside and to march further up into the country and to attack the king of Persia himself in his own home in Susa and Ecbatana not willing to let the monarch sit idle in his chair playing umpire in the conflicts of the Greeks and bribing their popular leaders

 This feeling of his to Thebes appeared further afterwards when Phoebidas in full peace most unjustifiably seized upon the Cadmea

 He had no arms upon him and scarcely clothes he had just anointed himself at home when upon the alarm without further waiting in that undress he snatched a spear in one hand and a sword in the other and broke his way through the combatants to the enemies striking at all he met

 She would further tell that Geminius a companion of Pompey s fell in love with her and made his court with great importunity and on her refusing and telling him however her inclinations were yet she could not gratify his desires for Pompey s sake he therefore made his request to Pompey and Pompey frankly gave his consent but never afterwards would have any converse with her notwithstanding that he seemed to have a great passion for her and Flora on this occasion showed none of the levity that might have been expected of her but languished for some time after under a sickness brought on by grief and desire

 To this he confessed thus far that he received them from his father when he took Asculum but pleaded further that he had lost them since upon Cinna s return to Rome when his home was broken open and plundered by Cinna s guards

 And yet further Caius Oppius the friend of Caesar tells us that Pompey dealt cruelly with Quintus Valerius a man of singular learning and science

 Now because Pompey had shown himself merciful to some of these pirates that were yet roving in bodies about the seas having upon their supplication ordered a seizure of their ships and persons only without any further process or severity therefore the rest of their comrades in hopes of mercy too made their escape from his other commanders and surrendered themselves with their wives and children into his protection

 And Timagenes even asserts that Ptolemy went away and left Egypt not out of necessity but purely upon the persuasion of Theophanes who was anxious to give Pompey the opportunity for holding a new command and gaining further wealth

 Thus by these means and practices they obtained the consulship neither did they behave themselves with more decency in their further proceedings but in the first place when the people were choosing Cato praetor and just ready with their votes for the poll Pompey broke up the assembly upon a pretext of some inauspicious appearance and having gained the tribes by money they publicly proclaimed Vatinius praetor

 Now Caesar having designed to raise his camp with the morning and move to Scotussa whilst the soldiers were busy in pulling down their tents and sending on their cattle and servants before them with their baggage there came in scouts who brought word that they saw arms carried to and fro in the enemy s camp and heard a noise and running up and down as of men preparing for battle not long after there came in other scouts with further intelligence that the first ranks were already set in battle array

 And what Scythian horse Parthian arrows or Indian riches could be able to resist seventy thousand Roman soldiers well appointed in arms under the command of two such generals as Pompey and Caesar whose names they had heard of before that of the Romans and whose prowess by their conquests of such wild remote savage and brutish nations was spread further than the fame of the Romans themselves Today they met in conflict and could no longer be induced to spare their country even out of regard for their own glory or the fear of losing the name which till this day both had held of having never yet been defeated

 So that without waiting for any further entreaty or discourse he took him into his ship together with as many of his company as he thought fit and hoisted sail

 Alexander taking hold of what she spoke declared he had received such an answer as he wished for and that it was needless to consult the god any further

 In the meantime Darius s captains having collected large forces were encamped on the further bank of the river Granicus and it was necessary to fight as it were in the gate of Asia for an entrance into it

 For being much inferior in numbers so far from allowing himself to be outflanked he stretched his right wing much further out than the left wing of his enemies and fighting there himself in the very foremost ranks put the barbarians to flight

 Of the rest of the female captives though remarkably handsome and well proportioned he took no further notice than to say jestingly that Persian women were terrible eye sores

 But Alexander before he proceeded any further thought it necessary to assure himself of the sea coast

 Then Alexander changing his expression desired to know of him if any of those who murdered Philip were yet unpunished and further concerning dominion whether the empire of the world was reserved for him This the god answered he should obtain and that Philip s death was fully revenged which gave him so much satisfaction that he made splendid offerings to Jupiter and gave the priests very rich presents

 But the death of Darius s wife in childbirth made him soon after regret one part of this answer and he showed evident marks of grief at being thus deprived of a further opportunity of exercising his clemency and good nature which he manifested however as far as he could by giving her a most sumptuous funeral

 The eunuch confirmed all he said with solemn and dreadful oaths and was further enlarging upon Alexander s moderation and magnanimity on other occasions when Darius breaking away from him into the other division of the tent where his friends and courtiers were lifted up his hands to heaven and uttered this prayer Ye gods said he of my family and of my kingdom if it be possible I beseech you to restore the declining affairs of Persia that I may leave them in as flourishing a condition as I found them and have it in my power to make a grateful return to Alexander for the kindness which in my adversity he has shown to those who are dearest to me

 The barbarians to show the power and nature of it sprinkled the street that led to the king s lodgings with little drops of it and when it was almost night stood at the further end with torches which being applied to the moistened places the first at once taking fire instantly as quick as a man could think of it it caught from one end to another in such a manner that the whole street was one continued flame

 The entrance into Persia was through a most difficult country and was guarded by the noblest of the Persians Darius himself having escaped further

 He stood still and accosting it as if it had been alive Shall we said he neglectfully pass thee by now thou art prostrate on the ground because thou once invadedst Greece or shall we erect thee again in consideration of the greatness of thy mind and thy other virtues But at last after he had paused some time and silently considered with himself he went on without taking any further notice of it

 He argued with them further how it was possible for anyone who pretended to be a soldier either to look well after his horse or to keep his armor bright and in good order who thought it much to let his hands be serviceable to what was nearest to him his own body

 And now with the flower of his army he marched into Hyrcania where he saw a large bay of an open sea apparently not much less than the Euxine with water however sweeter than that of other seas but could learn nothing of certainty concerning it further than that in all probability it seemed to him to be an arm issuing from the lake of Maeotis

 But this last combat with Porus took off the edge of the Macedonians courage and stayed their further progress into India

 For having found it hard enough to defeat an enemy who brought but twenty thousand foot and two thousand horse into the field they thought they had reason to oppose Alexander s design of leading them on to pass the Ganges too which they were told was thirty two furlongs broad and a hundred fathoms deep and the banks on the further side covered with multitudes of enemies

 And one who stood further off drew a bow with such just strength that the arrow finding its way through his cuirass stuck in his ribs under the breast

 They engaged they would and Pompey added further that he would meet their swords with a sword and buckler too

 There he sat down and employed himself in courting people s favor great numbers coming to him continually and always finding their requests answered for he never failed to dismiss all with present pledges of his kindness in hand and further hopes for the future

 Metellus again making resistance and some encouraging him in it Caesar in a louder tone told him he would put him to death if he gave him any further disturbance

 Thence he passed to Asia where he heard that Domitius was beaten by Pharnaces son of Mithridates and had fled out of Pontus with a handful of men and that Pharnaces pursued the victory so eagerly that though he was already master of Bithynia and Cappadocia he had a further design of attempting the Lesser Armenia and was inviting all the kings and tetrarchs there to rise

 For he not only pardoned many of those who fought against him but further to some gave honors and offices as particularly to Brutus and Cassius who both of them were praetors

 He proposed further to make great mounds on the shore nearest Rome to hinder the sea from breaking in upon the land to clear the coast at Ostia of all the hidden rocks and shoals that made it unsafe for shipping and to form ports and harbors fit to receive the large number of vessels that would frequent them

 Cassius when he perceived his ambition a little raised upon this was more instant than before to work him yet further having himself a private grudge against Caesar for some reasons that we have mentioned in the Life of Brutus

 When he was sat down he refused to comply with their requests and upon their urging him further began to reproach them severally for their importunities when Tillius laying hold of his robe with both his hands pulled it down from his neck which was the signal for the assault

 This indeed he made no scruple to admit when the oracle from Delphi was read which informed them that the Athenians were all of one mind a single dissentient only excepted frankly coming forward and declaring that they need look no further he was the man there was no one but he who was dissatisfied with everything they did

 Yet though difficult it is not I suppose impossible for men s tempers any more than for wines to be at the same time harsh and agreeable to the taste just as on the other hand many that are sweet at the first taste are found on further use extremely disagreeable and very unwholesome

 As for the idle talkers and disorderly bad citizens who ran off from his camp and made their way back he bade his officers not regard them since here they would have been not only useless and ungovernable themselves but an actual hindrance to the rest and further being conscious to themselves of the neglect of their duty they would be less ready to misrepresent the action or raise a cry against them at their return home

 This encouraged him once more to try his inclinations and upon further survey finding that he himself was a fortress inaccessible on every quarter to the approaches of corruption he professed a particular friendship to Phocion s son in law Charicles

 This commission disreputable enough in itself was yet further disparaged by the figure the piece of workmanship made after it was finished

 Polysperchon frequently interrupted Phocion till at last Phocion struck his staff on the ground and declined to speak further

 But the populace would not endure it crying out they were oligarchs and enemies to the liberty of the people and deserved to be stoned after which no man durst offer anything further in Phocion s behalf

 But as if this triumph had been insufficient the malice of Phocion s enemies went yet further his dead body was excluded from burial within the boundaries of the country and none of the Athenians could light a funeral pile to burn the corpse neither durst any of his friends venture to concern themselves about it

 So likewise the third time and still the same till they left off to ask any further

 For being excessively beloved and favored by the people they thought it a discredit to them not to make full repayment endeavoring by new public acts to outdo the honors they had received and again because of these new kindnesses incurring yet further distinctions till the people and they mutually inflamed and vieing thus with each other in honors and benefits brought things at last to such a pass that they might say that to engage so far was indeed a folly but to retreat would now be a shame

 He gently raised her up and assured her she need not fear any further violence or danger of death for her son and that if she pleased she might go in and see him

 Observing however that Octavius himself was an offender against this law and detained a great quantity of ground from the commonalty Tiberius desired him to forbear opposing him any further and proffered for the public good though he himself had but an indifferent estate to pay a price for Octavius s share at his own cost and charges

 He further sealed up the gates of Saturn s temple so that the treasurers could neither take any money out from thence or put any in

 It is also further observable that from the actions of the Gracchi Rome received no additions to her former greatness whereas under the conduct of Cleomenes Greece presently saw Sparta exert her sovereign power over all Peloponnesus and contest the supreme command with the most powerful princes of the time success in which would have freed Greece from Illyrian and Gaulish violence and placed her once again under the orderly rule of the sons of Hercules

 Yet it does not appear whether he had this feeling for his powers of speaking or for his life and character and meant to say that one word or nod from a man who was really trusted would go further than a thousand lengthy periods from others

 He further told them As we see corn masters sell their whole stock by a few grains of wheat which they carry about with them in a dish as a sample of the rest so you by delivering up us who are but a few do at the same time unawares surrender up yourselves all together with us so we find it related in the history of Aristobulus the Cassandrian

 On another occasion Vatinius a man of rude manners and often insolent in court to the magistrates who had large swellings on his neck came before his tribunal and made some request and on Cicero s desiring further time to consider it told him that he himself would have made no question about it had he been praetor

 Catiline impatient of further delay resolved himself to break forth and go to Manlius but he commanded Marcius and Cethegus to take their swords and go early in the morning to Cicero s gates as if only intending to salute him and then to fall upon him and slay him

 Junius Silanus further stated that several persons had heard Cethegus say that three consuls and four praetors were to be slain Piso also a person of consular dignity testified other matters of the like nature and Caius Sulpicius one of the praetors being sent to Cethegus s house found there a quantity of darts and of armor and a still greater number of swords and daggers all recently whetted

 Caesar and the tribunes all the more exasperated by this endeavored to create him further trouble and for this purpose proposed a law for calling Pompey home with his army to put an end to Cicero s usurpation

 He detected an embezzlement to a large amount in the public money and thus relieved the cities from their burdens at the same time that he allowed those who made restitution to retain without further punishment their rights as citizens

 And the senate fearing the young man and his extraordinary fortune endeavored by honors and gifts to call off the soldiers from him and to lessen his power professing there was no further need of arms now Antony was put to flight

 The fair name of the city forbids any further plain particulars let us only record the severe virtue of the young Damocles surnamed and by that surname pointed out to Demetrius the beautiful who to escape importunities avoided every place of resort and when at last followed into a private bathing room by Demetrius seeing none at hand to help or deliver seized the lid from the cauldron and plunging into the boiling water sought a death untimely and unmerited but worthy of the country and of the beauty that occasioned it

 And the next day he occupied himself in preparations for departing telling Alexander he had received intelligence that obliged him to leave and begging him to excuse so sudden a parting he would hope to see him further when his affairs allowed him leisure

 She refused to entertain any further hope and resolving to quit a fortune which was never permanent except for calamity took poison and died

 Seleucus excited by this advice moved with a powerful army towards Cilicia and Demetrius astonished at this sudden alteration betook himself for safety to the most inaccessible places of Mount Taurus from whence he sent envoys to Seleucus to request from him that he would permit him the liberty to settle with his army somewhere among the independent barbarian tribes where he might be able to make himself a petty king and end his life without further travel and hardship or if he refused him this at any rate to give his troops food during the winter and not expose him in this distressed and naked condition to the fury of his enemies

 But understanding that the conspirators had assembled in the Capitol and had no further design upon anyone he persuaded them to come down giving them his son as a hostage

 Caesar perceiving that Cicero s wishes were for liberty had ceased to pay any further regard to him and was now employing the mediation of his friends to come to a good understanding with Antony

 Ventidius was not willing to push his good fortune further for fear of raising some jealousy in Antony but turning his arms against those that had quitted the Roman interest he reduced them to their former obedience

 Antony first entertained Caesar this also being a concession on Caesar s part to his sister and when at length an agreement was made between them that Caesar should give Antony two of his legions to serve him in the Parthian war and that Antony should in return leave with him a hundred armed galleys Octavia further obtained of her husband besides this twenty light ships for her brother and of her brother a thousand foot for her husband

 The next day having put the baggage in order they marched back to the camp before Phraata in the way meeting with some scattering troops of the enemy and as they marched further with greater parties at length with the body of the enemy s army fresh and in good order who called them to battle and charged them on every side and it was not without great difficulty that they reached the camp

 This done upon further opportunity they rode nearer in and drawing up their horses by the men began to revile Antony for his obstinacy that whereas Phraates desired nothing more than peace and an occasion to show how ready he was to save the lives of so many brave soldiers he on the contrary gave no opening to any friendly offers but sat awaiting the arrival of the two fiercest and worst enemies winter and famine from whom it would be hard for them to make their escape even with all the good will of the Parthians to help them

 For instead of facing about with the whole body they sent small parties and when they were defeated they still sent out small parties so that by their bad management the rout would have spread through the whole army if Antony himself had not marched from the van at the head of the third legion and passing this through among the fugitives faced the enemies and hindered them from any further pursuit

 The Parthians finding that they could not divide the Roman army nor break the order of their battle and that withal they had been so often worsted once more began to treat the foragers with professions of humanity they came up to them with their bows unbended telling them that they were going home to their houses that this was the end of their retaliation and that only some Median troops would follow for two or three days not with any design to annoy them but for the defense of some of the villages further on

 Antony ran from one place to another begging they would have a little patience that not far off there was a river of wholesome water and that the rest of the way was so difficult for the horse that the enemy could pursue them no further and saying this he ordered to sound a retreat to call those back that were engaged and commanded the tents should be set up that the soldiers might at any rate refresh themselves in the shade

 And being seconded by the heavy infantry who covered one another as before described with their shields they bravely received the enemy who did not think convenient to advance any further while the van of the army marching forward leisurely in this manner came in sight of the river and Antony drawing up the cavalry on the banks to confront the enemy first passed over the sick and wounded

 No further offerings or libations expect from me these are the last honors that Cleopatra can pay your memory for she is to be hurried away far from you

 Dion supposing that this was all and that nothing further could come of his anger at Plato s request conveyed him aboard a galley which was conveying Pollis the Spartan into Greece

 Dion also received letters full of solicitations from his sister and his wife urging him to beg Plato to gratify Dionysius in this request and not give him an excuse for further ill doing

 But Dion fearing a descent too near his enemies and desirous to begin at a greater distance and further on in the country sailed on past Pachynus

 Timaeus to increase the mockery adds further that the boys tied him by his lame leg and so drew him through the streets while the Syracusans stood by laughing and jesting at the sight of that very man thus tied and dragged about by the leg who had told Dionysius that so far from flying on horseback from Syracuse he ought to wait till he should be dragged out by the heels

 In support of this Heraclides spoke and used the faction in favor of it to overpower Dion who opposed it and in fine he persuaded the people to ratify it by their vote and further to decree that the foreign soldiers should receive no pay and that they would elect new commanders and so be rid of Dion s oppression

 At which the factious ringleaders taking heart and hoping the enemy would rest content with what they had done and make no further attempt upon them persuaded the people again to reject Dion and if he came with the foreign soldiers not to admit him advising them not to yield as inferior to them in point of honor and courage but to save their city and defend their liberties and properties themselves

 But Posidonius the philosopher writes that it is true indeed what the history relates that two of the sons of Brutus who were of men s estate were put to death but that a third yet an infant was left alive from whom the family was propagated down to Marcus Brutus and further that there were several famous persons of this house in his time whose looks very much resembled the statue of Junius Brutus

 Now Brutus feeling that the noblest spirits of Rome for virtue birth or courage were depending upon him and surveying with himself all the circumstances of the dangers they were to encounter strove indeed as much as possible when abroad to keep his uneasiness of mind to himself and to compose his thoughts but at home and especially at night he was not the same man but sometimes against his will his working care would make him start out of his sleep and other times he was taken up with further reflection and consideration of his difficulties so that his wife that lay with him could not choose but take notice that he was full of unusual trouble and had in agitation some dangerous and perplexing question

 Antony desired that the will might be read and that the body should not have a private or dishonorable interment lest that should further exasperate the people

 Further he added that for his own part he had not as yet fully resolved whether he should make war or peace but that as to one point he was fixed and settled which was never to be a slave that he wondered Cicero should fear the dangers of a civil war and not be much more afraid of a dishonorable and infamous peace that the very reward that was to be given him for subverting Antony s tyranny was the privilege of establishing Caesar as tyrant in his place

 He adds further that Mark Antony had received a just punishment for his folly who when he might have been numbered with Brutus and Cassius and Cato would join himself to Octavius that though they should not now be both overcome they soon would fight between them selves

 But Theodotus though he had borrowed on from fortune a little further time for a poor despicable and wandering life yet did not lie hid from Brutus as he passed through Asia but being seized by him and executed had his death made more memorable than was his life

 Further it is said that some time before at a certain solemn procession a golden image of Victory which was carried before Cassius fell down by a slip of him that carried it

 Besides this there appeared many birds of prey daily about the camp and swarms of bees were seen in a place within the trenches which place the soothsayers ordered to be shut out from the camp to remove the superstition which insensibly began to infect even Cassius himself and shake him in his Epicurean philosophy and had wholly seized and subdued the soldiers from whence it was that Cassius was reluctant to put all to the hazard of a present battle but advised rather to draw out the war until further time considering that they were stronger in money and provisions but in numbers of men and arms inferior

 But now in my own fortunes I am of another mind for if Providence shall not dispose what we now undertake according to our wishes I resolve to put no further hopes or warlike preparations to the proof but will die contented with my fortune

 Brutus had now passed a little brook running among trees and under steep rocks and it being night would go no further but sat down in a hollow place with a great rock projecting before it with a few of his officers and friends about him

 For formerly he despised us and placing his hopes further off admired the Egyptian riches hearing so much of their elephants fleets and palaces

 However by this exploit he spoiled the scoffs and jests of those that flattered the tyrants and in their raillery would say that the Achaean general was usually troubled with a looseness when he was to fight a battle that the sound of a trumpet struck him with a drowsiness and a giddiness and that when he had drawn up his army and given the word he used to ask his lieutenants and officers whether there was any further need of his presence now the die was cast and then went aloof to await the result at a distance

 And so in anger he went at once and invaded Attica and penetrated as far as the Academy but then suffering himself to be pacified he did no further act of hostility

 He little regarding the injunction being not a bad but a light headed thoughtless man immediately the king took it off put it on and bedecked himself further with royal golden necklaces and women s ornaments to the great scandal of everybody the thing being quite unlawful

 Some historians further affirm in which number is Heraclides of Cuma that Artaxerxes married not only this one but a second daughter also Amestris of whom we shall speak by and by

 Teribazus perceiving him thus minded did his best to exasperate him yet further seeing in his injuries a representation of his own of which the following is the account Artaxerxes having many daughters promised to give Apama to Pharnabazus to wife Rhodogune to Orontes and Amestris to Teribazus whom alone of the three he disappointed by marrying Amestris himself

 He ordered the largesses which Nero had made to actors and wrestlers and such like to be strictly required again allowing only the tenth part to be retained though it turned to very small account most of those persons expending their daily income as fast as they received it being rude improvident livers upon which he had further inquiry made as to those who had bought or received from them and called upon these people to refund

 Marius Celsus collecting the officers urged the public interest Otho himself if he were a brave man would not after such an expense of Roman blood attempt anything further especially since even Cato and Scipio though the liberty of Rome was then at stake had been accused of being too prodigal of so many brave men s lives as were lost in Africa rather than submit to Caesar after the battle of Pharsalia had gone against them

 Johnson laughed at the incongruous ideas but the first thing which presented itself to the mind of an ingenious and learned friend whom I had the pleasure to pass some time with here at Florence was the same resemblance though I think the two characters had little in common further than an early attention to things beyond the capacity of other babies a keen sensibility of right and wrong and a warmth of imagination little consistent with sound and perfect health

 In the eighth and ninth books the perversions of States and of the individuals who correspond to them are reviewed in succession and the nature of pleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analyzed in the individual man

 Adeimantus pursues the argument further

 But let us consider this further point Is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow Certainly

 And instead of saying simply as we did at first that it is just to do good to our friends and harm to our enemies we should further say It is just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our enemies when they are evil Yes that appears to me to be the truth

 Now we are both agreed that justice is interest of some sort but you go on to say of the stronger about this addition I am not so sure and must therefore consider further

 Yes Cleitophon but he also said that justice is the interest of the stronger and while admitting both these propositions he further acknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his subjects to do what is not for his own interest whence follows that justice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger

 Because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends the sheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of himself or his master and you further imagine that the rulers of states if they are true rulers never think of their subjects as sheep and that they are not studying their own advantage day and night

 Consider further most foolish Socrates that the just is always a loser in comparison with the unjust

 This latter question need not be further discussed at present but when Thrasymachus says that the life of the unjust is more advantageous than that of the just his new statement appears to me to be of a far more serious character

 I know I said that such was your position but what I would further consider is whether this power which is possessed by the superior state can exist or be exercised without justice

 But whether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust is a further question which we also proposed to consider

 I think that they have and for the reasons which to have given but still I should like to examine further for no light matter is at stake nothing less than the rule of human life

 I left that enquiry and turned away to consider whether justice is virtue and wisdom or evil and folly and when there arose a further question about the comparative advantages of justice and injustice I could not refrain from passing on to that

 Some extend their rewards yet further the posterity as they say of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth generation

 Further there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time No doubt

 Such an one as we further maintain is sufficient for himself and his own happiness and therefore is least in need of other men

 And let us equally refuse to believe or allow to be repeated the tale of Theseus son of Poseidon or of Peirithous son of Zeus going forth as they did to perpetrate a horrid rape or of any other hero or son of a god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely ascribe to them in our day and let us further compel the poets to declare either that these acts were not done by them or that they were not the sons of gods both in the same breath they shall not be permitted to affirm

 And further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear them for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by The kindred of the gods the relatives of Zeus whose ancestral altar the attar of Zeus is aloft in air on the peak of Ida and who have the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins

 But shall our superintendence go no further and are the poets only to be required by us to express the image of the good in their works on pain if they do anything else of expulsion from our State Or is the same control to be extended to other artists and are they also to be prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative arts and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in our State lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him We would not have our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity as in some noxious pasture and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day little by little until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in their own soul

 Then I suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his love than a father would use to his son and then only for a noble purpose and he must first have the other s consent and this rule is to limit him in all his intercourse and he is never to be seen going further or if he exceeds he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and bad taste

 Would you say most I replied when you consider that there is a further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a life long litigant passing all his days in the courts either as plaintiff or defendant but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty able to take every crooked turn and wriggle into and out of every hole bending like a withy and getting out of the way of justice and all for what in order to gain small points not worth mentioning he not knowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping judge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing

 Let us not have a dispute with him about this I said but rather ask ourselves Is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man or can he live without it And if obligatory on him then let us raise a further question whether this dieting of disorders which is an impediment to the application of the mind t in carpentering and the mechanical arts does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of Phocylides Of that he replied there can be no doubt such excessive care of the body when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic is most inimical to the practice of virtue

 Clearly and his character is further illustrated by his sons

 Such then are our principles of nurture and education Where would be the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens or about their hunting and coursing their gymnastic and equestrian contests For these all follow the general principle and having found that we shall have no difficulty in discovering them

 And there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for them in which they will be made to give further proof of the same qualities

 And for this reason I said I shall not attempt to legislate further about them

 If there were four things and we were searching for one of them wherever it might be the one sought for might be known to us from the first and there would be no further trouble or we might know the other three first and then the fourth would clearly be the one left

 Then I may infer courage to be such as you describe Why yes said I you may and if you add the words of a citizen you will not be far wrong hereafter if you like we will carry the examination further but at present we are we w seeking not for courage but justice and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough

 Let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires and pains are generally found in children and women and servants and in the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class

 Further we affirmed that justice was doing one s own business and not being a busybody we said so again and again and many others have said the same to us

 And suppose the objector to refine still further and to draw the nice distinction that not only parts of tops but whole tops when they spin round with their pegs fixed on the spot are at rest and in motion at the same time and he may say the same of anything which revolves in the same spot his objection would not be admitted by us because in such cases things are not at rest and in motion in the same parts of themselves we should rather say that they have both an axis and a circumference and that the axis stands still for there is no deviation from the perpendicular and that the circumference goes round

 I perceive I said that you quite understand me there is however a further point which I wish you to consider

 But a further question arises Is passion different from reason also or only a kind of reason in which latter case instead of three principles in the soul there will only be two the rational and the concupiscent or rather as the State was composed of three classes traders auxiliaries counsellors so may there not be in the individual soul a third element which is passion or spirit and when not corrupted by bad education is the natural auxiliary of reason Yes he said there must be a third

 Excellent I said and you may see passion equally in brute animals which is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying

 Let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be subject to similar or nearly similar regulations then we shall see whether the result accords with our design

 And in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the guardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more perfect men or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling What a ridiculous question You have answered me I replied Well and may we not further say that our guardians are the best of our citizens By far the best

 Now these goings on must be a secret which the rulers only know or there will be a further danger of our herd as the guardians may be termed breaking out into rebellion

 Yes and there is a further good in the law viz

 Most certainly and I should be disposed to go further and say Let no one whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while the expedition lasts

 But before I proceed further I will make a division

 And further I said let us agree that they are lovers of all true being there is no part whether greater or less or more or less honourable which they are willing to renounce as we said before of the lover and the man of ambition

 The sailors are quarrelling with one another about the steering every one is of opinion that he has a right to steer though he has never learned the art of navigation and cannot tell who taught him or when he learned and will further assert that it cannot be taught and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who says the contrary

 Then let me crave your assent also to a further observation

 I might compare them to a man who should study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is fed by him he would learn how to approach and handle him also at what times and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse and what is the meaning of his several cries and by what sounds when another utters them he is soothed or infuriated and you may suppose further that when by continually attending upon him he has become perfect in all this he calls his knowledge wisdom and makes of it a system or art which he proceeds to teach although he has no real notion of what he means by the principles or passions of which he is speaking but calls this honourable and that dishonourable or good or evil or just or unjust all in accordance with the tastes and tempers of the great brute

 You recognise the truth of what I have been saying Then let me ask you to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe in the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful or of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind Certainly not

 But my friend I said a measure of such things Which in any degree falls short of the whole truth is not fair measure for nothing imperfect is the measure of anything although persons are too apt to be contented and think that they need search no further

 You are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge Yes

 Further do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to seem to be what is just and honourable without the reality but no one is satisfied with the appearance of good the reality is what they seek in the case of the good appearance is despised by every one

 And suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other side would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers by spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow No question he replied

 At first when any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and walk and look towards the light he will suffer sharp pains the glare will distress him and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows and then conceive some one saying to him that what he saw before was an illusion but that now when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more real existence he has a clearer vision what will be his reply And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them will he not be perplexed Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him Far truer

 I mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds some of them do not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them while in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that further enquiry is imperatively demanded

 And have you further observed that those who have a natural talent for calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge and even the dull if they have had an arithmetical training although they may derive no other advantage from it always become much quicker than they would otherwise have been

 Then must not a further admission be made What admission That the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal and not of aught perishing and transient

 But let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the subjects of opinion and of intellect for it will be a long enquiry many times longer than this has been

 Dialectic then as you will agree is the coping stone of the sciences and is set over them no other science can be placed higher the nature of knowledge can no further go I agree he said

 Further he of whom we are in search should have a good memory and be an unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line or he will never be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go through all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of him

 Yes I said and we have further acknowledged that the governors when appointed themselves will take their soldiers and place them in houses such as we were describing which are common to all and contain nothing private or individual and about their property you remember what we agreed Yes I remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions of mankind they were to be warrior athletes and guardians receiving from the other citizens in lieu of annual payment only their maintenance and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole State

 And you said further that if this was the true form then the others were false and of the false forms you said as I remember that there were four principal ones and that their defects and the defects of the individuals corresponding to them were worth examining

 Further when she sees her husband not very eager about money and instead of battling and railing in the law courts or assembly taking whatever happens to him quietly and when she observes that his thoughts always centre in himself while he treats her with very considerable indifference she is annoyed and says to her son that his father is only half a man and far too easy going adding all the other complaints about her own ill treatment which women are so fond of rehearsing

 Yet consider Must we not further admit that owing to this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires as of pauper and rogue which are forcibly kept down by his general habit of life True

 Moreover they are paid for this and receive honour the greatest honour as might be expected from tyrants and the next greatest from democracies but the higher they ascend our constitution hill the more their reputation fails and seems unable from shortness of breath to proceed further

 Then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which has already happened to the father he is drawn into a perfectly lawless life which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty and his father and friends take part with his moderate desires and the opposite party assist the opposite ones

 Further I said has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant He has

 Who is that He who is of a tyrannical nature and instead of leading a private life has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant

 Further the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not possessed by the covetous or ambitious man but only by the philosopher What faculty Reason with whom as we were saying the decision ought to rest

 Do not rely I said on a probability derived from the analogy of painting but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad

 And we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to States and to human life and we will listen in a kindly spirit for if this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers I mean if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight Certainly he said we shall the gainers

 And now Glaucon there will be no harm in further enumerating how many and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues procure to the soul from gods and men both in life and after death

 Go further next time

 Sucking duck eggs by God till further orders

 They believe in rod the scourger almighty creator of hell upon earth and in Jacky Tar the son of a gun who was conceived of unholy boast born of the fighting navy suffered under rump and dozen was scarified flayed and curried yelled like bloody hell the third day he arose again from the bed steered into haven sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid

 But he further added it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together

 BLOOM MUMBLES Awaiting your further orders we remain gentlemen 

 The entire audience waited anticipating an additional detonation there being still a further egg

 His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to

 Couldn t Stephen contrived to get out his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further

 For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it

 Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves none the worse for wear however and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving EMBONPOINT

 Then I went away from him and abode a long while without further news

 Upon this Lyonell so was the young gentleman called told and discourst unto him from point to point how he was falne in love with a gentlewoman that was married to one of his profession discovered her dwelling and the house for that he was unacquainted with the woman and a man little experienced in love matters he required his favour to further him with his advice

 Mutio at this motion was stung to the hart knowing it was his wife hee was fallen in love withall yet to conceale the matter and to experience his wive s chastity and that if she plaide false he might be revenged on them both he dissembled the matter and answered that he knewe the woman very well and commended her highly but said she had a churle to her husband and therefore he thought shee would bee the more tractable Trye her man quoth hee fainte harte never wonne faire lady and if shee will not be brought to the bent of your bowe I will provide such a potion as shall dispatch all to your owne content and to give you further instructions for oportunitie knowe that her husband is foorth every after noone from three till sixe

 It evidently would require no small share of casuistry to construe this declaration into an acceptance of the bargain but the Saracens having heard the offer of their sovereign deliberately counted out the stipulated sum on the mantle of Sir Isumbras took possession of the lady carried the knight with his infant son on shore beat him till he was scarcely able to move and then returned for further orders

 I think there is internal evidence apart from the existence of the Tibetan version to lead to the conclusion that the story is of Buddhist extraction and if such be the fact it furnishes a further example of the indebtedness of Christian hagiology to Buddhist tales and legends

 Chapter vii Containing better reasons than any which have yet appeared for the conduct of Partridge an apology for the weakness of Jones and some further anecdotes concerning my landlady

 Chapter iii A further explanation of the foregoing design

 Chapter viii Further continuation

 Chapter ix A further continuation

 Without further preface then I here present you with the labours of some years of my life

 The ingenuity of this behaviour had gained Jenny so much credit with this worthy man that he easily believed what she told him for as she had disdained to excuse herself by a lie and had hazarded his further displeasure in her present situation rather than she would forfeit her honour or integrity by betraying another he had but little apprehensions that she would be guilty of falsehood towards himself

 Tom was then interrogated who was with him which Mr Allworthy declared he was resolved to know acquainting the culprit with the circumstance of the two guns which had been deposed by the squire and both his servants but Tom stoutly persisted in asserting that he was alone yet to say the truth he hesitated a little at first which would have confirmed Mr Allworthy s belief had what the squire and his servants said wanted any further confirmation

 Honour cryed Thwackum with some warmth mere stubbornness and obstinacy Can honour teach any one to tell a lie or can any honour exist independent of religion This discourse happened at table when dinner was just ended and there were present Mr Allworthy Mr Thwackum and a third gentleman who now entered into the debate and whom before we proceed any further we shall briefly introduce to our reader s acquaintance

 He was besides the best sacrifice the higgler could make as he had supplied him with no game since and by this means the witness had an opportunity of screening his better customers for the squire being charmed with the power of punishing Black George whom a single transgression was sufficient to ruin made no further enquiry

 And now without any further preface we proceed to our next chapter

 In the morning Sophia did not fail to remind him of his engagement and his attorney was immediately sent for ordered to stop any further proceedings in the action and to make out the deputation

 Here however I conceive an objection may be raised which if it could not fully be answered would totally deter me from any further pursuit

 But before we attend him on this expedition we shall resort awhile to Mr Western s and see what further happened to the charming Sophia

 Sophia kept silence during the foregoing speech of her father nor did she once answer otherwise than with a sigh but as he understood none of the language or as he called it lingo of the eyes so he was not satisfied without some further approbation of his sentiments which he now demanded of his daughter telling her in the usual way he expected she was ready to take the part of everybody against him as she had always done that of the b her mother

 It may perhaps be asked Why then did he not put an immediate end to all further courtship I answer for that very reason as well as for several others equally good which we shall now proceed to open to the reader

 On the contrary this served rather to heighten the pleasure he proposed in rifling her charms as it added triumph to lust nay he had some further views from obtaining the absolute possession of her person which we detest too much even to mention and revenge itself was not without its share in the gratifications which he promised himself

 And since she saw her mistress so determined she desisted from any further dissuasions

 Containing better reasons than any which have yet appeared for the conduct of Partridge an apology for the weakness of Jones and some further anecdotes concerning my landlady

 You will easily believe sir that such a life as I am now describing must be incompatible with my further progress in learning and that in proportion as I addicted myself more and more to loose pleasure I must grow more and more remiss in application to my studies

 However as the case was really otherwise I forged another falsehood and told my companion I had been at the further end of the city on business of consequence and had snapt up a mutton chop in haste so that I was again hungry and wished he would add a beef steak to his bottle

 We were prevented from any further discourse at present by the arrival of the apothecary who with much joy in his countenance and without even asking his patient how he did proclaimed there was great news arrived in a letter to himself which he said would shortly be public That the Duke of Monmouth was landed in the west with a vast army of Dutch and that another vast fleet hovered over the coast of Norfolk and was to make a descent there in order to favour the duke s enterprize with a diversion on that side

 I have not sir cried Jones the assurance to ask it of you now indeed it would be cruel after so much breath as you have already spent but you will give me leave to wish for some further opportunity of hearing the excellent observations which a man of your sense and knowledge of the world must have made in so long a course of travels

 And now Jones upon further enquiry was sufficiently assured that the bearer of this muff was no other than the lovely Sophia herself

 However she no sooner found herself alone than she abandoned all thoughts of further repose and as she had sufficient reason to be dissatisfied with her present lodging she dressed herself with all possible expedition

 Mr Pope however very luckily found them in the said play and laying violent hands on his own property transferred it back again into his own works and for a further punishment imprisoned the said Moore in the loathsome dungeon of the Dunciad where his unhappy memory now remains and eternally will remain as a proper punishment for such his unjust dealings in the poetical trade

 Lookee friend cries Jones the right owner shall certainly have again all that she lost and as for any farther gratuity I really cannot give it you at present but let me know your name and where you live and it is more than possible you may hereafter have further reason to rejoice at this morning s adventure

 Jones no sooner heard this than he quitted the master laying on him at the same time the most violent injunctions of forbearance from any further insult on the Merry Andrew and then taking the poor wretch with him into his own apartment he soon learned tidings of his Sophia whom the fellow as he was attending his master with his drum the day before had seen pass by

 Dowling very earnestly pressed Mr Jones to go no further that night and backed his solicitations with many unanswerable arguments such as that it was almost dark that the roads were very dirty and that he would be able to travel much better by day light with many others equally good some of which Jones had probably suggested to himself before but as they were then ineffectual so they were still and he continued resolute in his design even though he should be obliged to set out on foot

 Indeed half his natural flow of animal spirits joined to the sweetness of his temper was sufficient to make a most amiable companion and notwithstanding the heaviness of his heart so agreeable did he make himself on the present occasion that at their breaking up the young gentleman earnestly desired his further acquaintance

 Indeed the sensations of pleasure it gives are much more constant as well as much keener than those which that blind lady bestows nature having wisely contrived that some satiety and languor should be annexed to all our real enjoyments lest we should be so taken up by them as to be stopt from further pursuits

 Without further preface then I come to you Mr Nightingale from a worthy family which you have involved in misery and ruin

 A further explanation of the foregoing design

 Matters being thus agreed on his lordship took his leave and her ladyship retired to rest highly pleased with a project of which she had no reason to doubt the success and which promised so effectually to remove Sophia from being any further obstruction to her amour with Jones by a means of which she should never appear to be guilty even if the fact appeared to the world but this she made no doubt of preventing by huddling up a marriage to which she thought the ravished Sophia would easily be brought to consent and at which all the rest of her family would rejoice

 The subject of this was his infidelity to her young lady on which she enlarged with great bitterness but Jones at last found means to reconcile her and not only so but to obtain a promise of most inviolable secrecy and that she would the next morning endeavour to find out Sophia and bring him a further account of the proceedings of the squire

 While she was thus running on a violent knocking at the door interrupted their conversation and prevented her from proceeding further or from receiving any answer for as she concluded this was a visitor to Mr Allworthy she hastily retired taking with her her little girl whose eyes were all over blubbered at the melancholy news she heard of Jones who used to call her his little wife and not only gave her many playthings but spent whole hours in playing with her himself

 I think parents who act in this manner are accessories to all the guilt which their children afterwards incur and of course must before a just judge expect to partake of their punishment but if they could avoid this good heaven is there a soul who can bear the thought of having contributed to the damnation of his child For these reasons my best neighbour as I see the inclinations of this young lady are most unhappily averse to my nephew I must decline any further thoughts of the honour you intended him though I assure you I shall always retain the most grateful sense of it

 Can I bear to hear this cries Mrs Western from a girl who hath now a letter from a murderer in her pocket I have no such letter I promise you answered Sophia and if he be a murderer he will soon be in no condition to give you any further disturbance

 Mr Allworthy with great chearfulness told her that he had much good news to communicate and with little further preface acquainted her that he had brought Mr Nightingale to consent to see his son and did not in the least doubt to effect a perfect reconciliation between them though he found the father more sowered by another accident of the same kind which had happened in his family

 Further continuation

 A further continuation

 I hope therefore you will not think the design of this visit is to trouble you with any further solicitations of that kind but entirely to relieve you from them

 She hath already suffered enough from solicitations which I hate to think of she shall owe no further constraint to my family I know her father will be as ready to torment her now on your account as he hath formerly been on another s but I am determined she shall suffer no more confinement no more violence no more uneasy hours

 Fitzpatrick who had been so well satisfied by Mrs Waters concerning the innocence of his wife with Jones at Upton or perhaps from some other reasons was now become so indifferent to that matter that he spoke highly in favour of Jones to Lord Fellamar took all the blame upon himself and said the other had behaved very much like a gentleman and a man of honour and upon that lord s further enquiry concerning Mr Jones Fitzpatrick told him he was nephew to a gentleman of very great fashion and fortune which was the account he had just received from Mrs Waters after her interview with Dowling

 I will not dare to press anything further than you permit me

 If they continued to sing like their great predecessor of romantic themes they were drawn as by a kind of magnetic attraction into the Homeric style and manner of treatment and became mere echoes of the Homeric voice in a word Homer had so completely exhausted the epic genre that after him further efforts were doomed to be merely conventional

 Further the insignificance of Triptolemus and Eumolpus point to considerable antiquity and the digamma is still active

 But I will give you no more nor give you further measure

 And further still you went O far shooting Apollo and came to Onchestus Poseidon s bright grove there the new broken cold distressed with drawing the trim chariot gets spirit again and the skilled driver springs from his car and goes on his way

 Further yet you went O far shooting Apollo and reached next Cephissus sweet stream which pours forth its sweet flowing water from Lilaea and crossing over it O worker from afar you passed many towered Ocalea and reached grassy Haliartus

 Further yet you went far shooting Apollo until you came to the town of the presumptuous Phlegyae who dwell on this earth in a lovely glade near the Cephisian lake caring not for Zeus

 As for this fellow we men will see to him I reckon he is bound for Egypt or for Cyprus or to the Hyperboreans or further still

 When he saw her beauty and grace he said to her Harkye Do thou take me to husband and I will be tenderly solicitous over thee and use thee with exceeding compassion and I will further thee in obedience to God the Most High

 Quoth she I will not trust to thy word but will go with thee and help thee to that which thou desirest of this and further thee myself therein

 We waited till she opened the door whereupon without further parley we forced our way into the house and rushed in upon the girl whom we found seated with the Jew in a saloon with four estrades and cooking pots and candles therein

 Then said he O Sindbad God forbid that we should covet that which God the Most High hath vouchsafed unto thee Nay it behoveth us rather to further thee on thy return to thine own country

 The author may have intended to connect them with the story by means of a further development of the latter and with the characteristic carelessness of the Eastern story teller forgotten or neglected to carry out his intention or again it is possible that the words in question may have been intended as an introduction to the Story of the Favourite and her Lover see post p

 It need not be said further that although Chaucer freely handled the errors the ignorance and vices of the clergy he did so rather as a man of sense and of conscience than as a Wycliffite and there is no evidence that he espoused the opinions of the zealous Reformer far less played the part of an extreme and self regardless partisan of his old friend and college companion

 Yet besides further had this Meliboeus in his council many folk that privily in his ear counselled him certain thing and counselled him the contrary in general audience

 Meliboeus argues that if he refrains from taking vengeance he will invite his enemies to do him further wrong and he will be put and held over low but Prudence contends that such a result can be brought about only by the neglect of the judges not by the patience of the individual

 And yet further shall he not only busy him in keeping his good name but he shall also enforce him alway to do some thing by which he may renew his good name for it is written that the old good los reputation of a man is soon gone and passed when it is not renewed

 Further contrition should be wonder sorrowful and anguishous and also continual with steadfast purpose of confession and amendment

 By the aid of Apollo who tended the flocks of Admetus during his banishment from heaven the suitor fulfilled the condition and Apollo further induced the Moirae or Fates to grant that Admetus should never die if his father mother or wife would die for him

 Pursuing his researches further out of the region of reputation or fame proper into that of tidings or rumours the poet is led by a man who has entered into conversation with him to a vast whirling house of twigs ever open to the arrival of tidings ever full of murmurings whisperings and clatterings coming from the vast crowds that fill it for every rumour every piece of news every false report appears there in the shape of the person who utters it or passes it on down in earth

 But here the poet meets with a man of great authority and half afraid awakes skilfully whether by intention fatigue or accident leaving the reader disappointed by the nonfulfilment of what seemed to be promises of further disclosures

 But since that Jovis of his grace As I have said will thee solace Finally with these ilke things same These uncouth sightes and tidings To pass away thy heaviness Such ruth hath he of thy distress compassion That thou suff rest debonairly gently And know st thyselven utterly Desperate of alle bliss Since that Fortune hath made amiss The fruit of all thy hearte s rest Languish and eke in point to brest on the point of breaking But he through his mighty merite Will do thee ease all be it lite little And gave express commandement To which I am obedient To further thee with all my might And wiss and teache thee aright direct Where thou may st moste tidings hear Shalt thou anon many one lear

 If he found me bustling about doing any little thing he sometimes half took his coat off as if with an intention of helping by a great exertion but he never got any further

 What would he do whether or not Act as if I was shut my mouth up tell me not to commit myself keep circumstances back chop the evidence small quibble and get me off perhaps But Miss Summerson do I care for getting off in that way or would I rather be hanged in my own way if you ll excuse my mentioning anything so disagreeable to a lady He had warmed into his subject now and was under no further necessity to wait a bit

 Further he often sees damaging letters produced in evidence and has occasion to reflect that it was a green thing to write them

 Now only you put that to Lady Dedlock Sir Leicester Dedlock Baronet and ask her ladyship whether even after he had left here she didn t go down to his chambers with the intention of saying something further to him dressed in a loose black mantle with a deep fringe to it

 Tulkinghorn had the intention of communicating the whole to you as soon as he considered it ripe and further that he had given her ladyship so to understand

 Now my dear put your arm a little further through mine and hold it steady and I shan t hurt you In a trice Mr

 If it was not for my promise to Miss Summerson and my keeping of it sacred I in point of fact shouldn t have darkened these doors again but should have seen em further first

 They came back wiping their hands upon their coats after turning over something wet but thank God it was not what I feared After some further conference Mr

 They cushioned me up on a large sofa by the fire and then the comely landlady told me that I must travel no further to night but must go to bed

 Volumnia further makes a merit of not having closed an eye as if she had twenty or thirty though it is hard to reconcile this statement with her having most indisputably opened two within five minutes

 It s not necessary for me to give you any further caution than to tell you that we have marked this person down and that you may be of use to me before I know it myself

 You would further have seen that the interests of Mr

 I further take the liberty to make known to you that it was got from me as a proof of handwriting only and that otherwise I would not have given it up as appearing to be the most harmless in my possession without being previously shot through the heart

 I further take the liberty to mention that if I could have supposed a certain unfortunate gentleman to have been in existence I never could and never would have rested until I had discovered his retreat and shared my last farthing with him as my duty and my inclination would have equally been

 I further take the liberty to state that in my humble quality as one of the rank and file I am and shall ever continue to be your thoroughly devoted and admiring servant and that I esteem the qualities you possess above all others far beyond the limits of the present dispatch

 I am further very sure that my ward loves your son but will sacrifice her love to a sense of duty and affection and will sacrifice it so completely so entirely so religiously that you should never suspect it though you watched her night and day

 Very well You are further to reflect Mr

 Sir Leicester is not particular what it is and does not appear to follow it very closely further than that he always comes broad awake the moment Volumnia ventures to leave off and sonorously repeating her last words begs with some displeasure to know if she finds herself fatigued

 Caddy keeps her own little carriage now instead of hiring one and lives full two miles further westward than Newman Street

 The incertain pleasures of swift footed time Have ta en their flight and left me in despair And of my former riches rests no more But bare remembrance like a soldier s scar That has no further comfort for his maim

 No further tis a custom held with us That when we speak with Gentiles like to you We turn into the air to purge ourselves For unto us the promise doth belong

 Well go whither he will I ll be none of his followers in haste and now I think on t going to the execution a fellow met me with a muschatoes like a raven s wing and a dagger with a hilt like a warming pan and he gave me a letter from one Madam Bellamira saluting me in such sort as if he had meant to make clean my boots with his lips the effect was that I should come to her house I wonder what the reason is it may be she sees more in me than I can find in myself for she writes further that she loves me ever since she saw me and who would not requite such love Here s her house and here she comes and now would I were gone I am not worthy to look upon her

 Was this the banquet he prepar d for us Let s hence lest further mischief be pretended

 To recognize and interpret the symbols presented to him requires part of this power to arrange and combine the images suggested requires a further part and only that part which remains can be used for realizing the thought conveyed

 The further superiority possessed by Saxon English in its comparative brevity obviously comes under the same generalization

 A further cause may be that a word of several syllables admits of more emphatic articulation and as emphatic articulation is a sign of emotion the unusual impressiveness of the thing named is implied by it

 And without further explanation it will be manifest that in the use of prepositions and other particles most languages spontaneously conform with more or less completeness to this law

 Pursuing the principle yet further it is obvious that for producing the greatest effect not only should the main divisions of a sentence observe this sequence but the subdivisions of these should be similarly arranged

 Now however we must notice a further condition to be fulfilled in the proper construction of a sentence but still a condition dictated by the same general principle with the other the condition namely that the words and expressions most nearly related in thought shall be brought the closest together

 The passage quoted below from Paradise Lost affords a fine instance of a sentence well arranged alike in the priority of the subordinate members in the avoidance of long and numerous suspensions and in the correspondence between the order of the clauses and the sequence of the phenomena described which by the way is a further prerequisite to easy comprehension and therefore to effect

 But a further improvement may be produced by introducing the words we came still earlier especially if at the same time the qualifications be rearranged in conformity with the principle already explained that the more abstract elements of the thought should come before the more concrete

 Before dismissing this branch of our subject it should be further remarked that even when addressing the most vigorous intellects the direct style is unfit for communicating ideas of a complex or abstract character

 The same principle may in some cases be advantageously carried yet further by indirectly suggesting some entirely distinct thought in addition to the one expressed

 Further it may be noticed that extreme brevity is another characteristic of passionate language

 Further let it be remarked that in brevity the other requisite of forcible expression which theory points out and emotion spontaneously fulfils poetical phraseology similarly differs from ordinary phraseology

 But we may briefly indicate a further aspect of the general principle hitherto traced out and hint a few of its wider applications

 But this extension of the general principle of economy this further condition to effective composition that the sensitiveness of the faculties must be continuously husbanded includes much more than has been yet hinted

 Further we may infer from it not only that we should avoid generally combining our words in one manner however good or working out our figures and illustrations in one way however telling but that we should avoid anything like uniform adherence even to the wider conditions of effect

 Keen observation and skilful analysis would in like manner detect further peculiarities of expression produced by other attitudes of mind and by paying due attention to all such traits a writer possessed of sufficient versatility might make some approach to a completely organized work

 They think therefore none of those pleasures are to be valued any further than as they are necessary yet they rejoice in them and with due gratitude acknowledge the tenderness of the great Author of Nature who has planted in us appetites by which those things that are necessary for our preservation are likewise made pleasant to us

 They also entertain themselves with the other delights let in at their eyes their ears and their nostrils as the pleasant relishes and seasoning of life which Nature seems to have marked out peculiarly for man since no other sort of animals contemplates the figure and beauty of the universe nor is delighted with smells any further than as they distinguish meats by them nor do they apprehend the concords or discords of sound

 Sally shouted a more persistent voice are ye goin to be all night with that there beer I do think father might get the beer for them muttered Sally as Jemima stolidly and without further comment took a couple of foam crowned jugs from the shelf and began filling a number of pewter tankards with some of that home brewed ale for which The Fisherman s Rest had been famous since that days of King Charles

 The young Vicomte who had not elected to follow his mother in her dignified exit now made a step forward ready to champion the Comtesse should Lady Blakeney aim any further shafts at her

 Evidently the one face she wished to see was not there for she settled herself quietly behind her mother listened apathetically to the music and took no further interest in the audience itself

 Chauvelin was taking no further heed of her

 By all means They are among the lucky ones then Lord Grenville turned in search of the Comtesse who sat at the further end of the room

 She was too clever to overdo her part and made no further allusions to the supposed BILLET DOUX which had caused Sir Andrew Ffoulkes such an agonising five minutes

 The next moment Sir Percy himself appeared round the further corner of the house and came quickly towards the horses

 Suzanne instinctively turned back her heart told her that here perhaps was further ill news for her friend and she felt that poor Margot was not in a fit state to bear any more

 After a sleepless night she rose early wild with excitement dying to start on her journey terrified lest further obstacles lay in her way

 Even the women went about with a curious look of fear and of hate lurking in their brown eyes and all watched Marguerite as she stepped on shore followed by Sir Andrew and murmured as she passed along SACRES ARISTOS or else SACRES ANGLAIS Otherwise their presence excited no further comment

 He looked with some suspicion and a great deal of contempt at the two travellers muttering SACRRRES ANGLAIS and spat upon the ground to further show his independence of spirit but nevertheless he stood aside to let them enter no doubt well aware that these same SACCRES ANGLAIS always had well filled purses

 The landlord of the Chat Gris by name Brogard had taken no further notice of his guests he concluded that presently they would order supper and in the meanwhile it was not for a free citizen to show deference or even courtesy to anyone however smartly they might be dressed

 Indeed Brogard having placed what was strictly necessary upon the table seemed not to trouble himself any further about his guests

 Sir Andrew obeyed her without further comment

 Brogard was taking no further heed of her

 The roads and the beach are patrolled as usual citoyen and Captain Jutley awaits further orders

 The men he continued are to keep the sharpest possible look out for any stranger who may be walking riding or driving along the road or the beach more especially for a tall stranger whom I need not describe further as probably he will be disguised but he cannot very well conceal his height except by stooping

 Marguerite vaguely wondered what further devilish plans he could have formed in order to entrap one brave man alone against two score of others

 I have further news for you citoyen

 Chauvelin without further comment took a few pieces of gold out of his own pocket and leaving them in the palm of his hand he allowed them to jingle as he held them out towards the Jew

 How far can you drive me in it As far as the Pere Blanchard s hut your Honour and further than Reuben s nag took your friend

 There he could get fresh conveyance if he wanted to go further He could if he ever got so far

 Suddenly those same keen instincts within her made her pause in her mad haste and cower still further within the shadow of the hedge

 The men had sprung to their feet there was no need for further silence on their part the very cliffs echoed the poor heart broken woman s screams

 The door was partially open on of the soldiers pushed it further but within all was darkness the charcoal fire only lighting with a dim red light the furthest corner of the hut

 The soldiers paused automatically at the door like machines waiting for further orders

 Yes said Chauvelin with eager impatience she had shoved off some time ago you said and the nearest creek is a mile further on

 Close to him Desgas still stood mute and impassive waiting for further orders whilst two soldiers were kneeling beside the prostrate form of Marguerite

 Against a rock on a hard bed of stone lay the unconscious figure of Marguerite Blakeney while some few paces further on the unfortunate Jew was receiving on his broad back the blows of two stout leather belts wielded by the stolid arms of two sturdy soldiers of the Republic

 He had my orders to go out further to sea and then towards the west

 They walked on inland till they were far enough from the ship to be out of sight when Bahram sat down and taking from his pocket a kettle drum FN of copper and a silken strap worked in gold with characts beat the drum with the strap until there arose a cloud of dust from the further side of the waste

 When the damsels saw their brother slay the Magian they joyed in him with exceeding joy and gat round him marvelling at his valour and prowess FN and thanked him for his deed and gave him joy of his safety saying O Hasan thou hast done a deed whereby thou hast healed the burning of him that thirsteth for vengeance and pleased the King of Omnipotence Then they returned to the palace and he abode with them eating and drinking and laughing and making merry and indeed his sojourn with them was joyous to him and he forgot his mother FN but while he led with them this goodly life one day behold there arose from the further side of the desert a great cloud of dust that darkened the welkin and made towards them

 She ceased not to conjure them to further her brother in the accomplishment of his desire and to weep before them till she made them weep and they said to her Hearten thy heart we will do our best endeavour to bring about his reunion with his family Inshallah And he abode with them a whole year during which his eyes never could retain their tears

 When it was the Eight Hundred and Thirtieth Night She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that Hasan began relating to Shaykh Abd al Kaddus and Shaykh Abu al Ruwaysh who sat chattting in the cave all that had passed first and last till he came to the tale of the rod and cap where upon quoth Abd al Kaddus O my son thou hast delivered thy wife and thy children and hast no further need of the two

 Bear witness against him O merchants By Allah O unhappy thou art debarred from further claim on me So Khalif turned back blaming himself and saying There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Alas that I did not take the gold and fared on blaming himself in the matter of the money till he came to the Tigris but found not the two apes whereupon he wept and slapped his face and strewed dust on his head saying But that the second ape wheedled me and put a cheat on me the one eyed ape had not escaped

 When it was the Eight Hundred and Eighty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Nur al Din and Miriam the Girdle girl rose forthwith and donned her clothes and ornaments but this was grievous to Nur al Din and his gladness was troubled the tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these couplets I ceas d not to kiss that cheek with budding roses dight And eyes down cast and bit the same with most emphatic bite Until we were in gloria FN and lay him down the spy And sank his eyes within his brain declining further sight And struck the gongs as they that had the charge of them were like Muezzin crying duty prayers in Allah s book indite

 Last that it will be primely to the discouragement of all learning and the stop of truth not only by disexercising and blunting our abilities in what we know already but by hindering and cropping the discovery that might be yet further made both in religious and civil wisdom

 And that the primitive Councils and bishops were wont only to declare what books were not commendable passing no further but leaving it to each one s conscience to read or to lay by till after the year is observed already by Padre Paolo the great unmasker of the Trentine Council

 Who shall regulate all the mixed conversation of our youth male and female together as is the fashion of this country Who shall still appoint what shall be discoursed what presumed and no further Lastly who shall forbid and separate all idle resort all evil company These things will be and must be but how they shall be least hurtful how least enticing herein consists the grave and governing wisdom of a state

 And now the time in special is by privilege to write and speak what may help to the further discussing of matters in agitation

 For when God shakes a kingdom with strong and healthful commotions to a general reforming tis not untrue that many sectaries and false teachers are then busiest in seducing but yet more true it is that God then raises to his own work men of rare abilities and more than common industry not only to look back and revise what hath been taught heretofore but to gain further and go on some new enlightened steps in the discovery of truth

 Beyond this row of buttresses and further from the bridge and also further from the water which here suddenly bends are the pretty oriel windows of Mr Harding s house and his well mown lawn

 Mr Bunce was inclined to think that the warden and himself could manage the hospital without further assistance and that though the bishop was the constitutional visitor and as such entitled to special reverence from all connected with John Hiram s will John Hiram never intended that his affairs should be interfered with by an archdeacon

 The bishop had no further argument to adduce he could not fight for the cause as his son would do he could not prove all the precentor s doubts to be groundless but he could sympathise with his friend and he did so and Mr Harding felt that he had received that for which he came

 And then without waiting for an answer he described to her as he best could the accusation that was made about Hiram s will the claims which the old men put forward what he considered the strength and what the weakness of his own position the course which Bold had taken and that which he presumed he was about to take and then by degrees without further question he presumed on the fact of Eleanor s love and spoke of that love as a feeling which he could in no way disapprove he apologised for Bold excused what he was doing nay praised him for his energy and intentions made much of his good qualities and harped on none of his foibles then reminding his daughter how late it was and comforting her with much assurance which he hardly felt himself he sent her to her room with flowing eyes and a full heart

 When Mr Harding met his daughter at breakfast the next morning there was no further discussion on the matter nor was the subject mentioned between them for some days

 Could you tell me to do so And he appealed almost in tears to the bishop who had left his chair and was now leaning on the warden s arm as he stood on the further side of the table facing the archdeacon

 Mr Harding sat down with his back to the further wall playing to himself some air fitted for so calamitous an occasion and the archdeacon said out his say standing with his back to the empty fire place

 The Jupiter publishes an article which a great many no doubt will read but of those who understand the subject how many will believe The Jupiter Everyone knows what its object is it has taken up the case against Lord Guildford and against the Dean of Rochester and that against half a dozen bishops and does not everyone know that it would take up any case of the kind right or wrong false or true with known justice or known injustice if by doing so it could further its own views Does not all the world know this of The Jupiter Who that really knows you will think the worse of you for what The Jupiter says And why care for those who do not know you I will say nothing of your own comfort but I do say that you could not be justified in throwing up in a fit of passion for such it would be the only maintenance that Eleanor has and if you did so if you really did vacate the wardenship and submit to ruin what would that profit you If you have no future right to the income you have had no past right to it and the very fact of your abandoning your position would create a demand for repayment of that which you have already received and spent

 But Mary she continued you must now you know cease any joking about me and Mr Bold you must now say no more about that I am not ashamed to beg this favour from your brother but when I have done so there can never be anything further between us and this she said with a staid and solemn air quite worthy of Jephthah s daughter or of Iphigenia either

 Bold wished with all his heart that the Australian scheme was in the act of realisation and that he and Eleanor were away together never to hear further of the lawsuit

 He promised however that he would use his best influence to prevent any further personal allusion being made to Mr Harding

 Oh that she should have dared to keep me in the room when I tried to get out Eleanor however felt that the game was up and that she had now nothing further to do but to add to the budget of news which was prepared for her father that John Bold was her accepted lover

 We will however now leave her on her way and go with John Bold to Plumstead Episcopi merely premising that Eleanor on reaching home will not find things so smooth as she fondly expected two messengers had come one to her father and the other to the archdeacon and each of them much opposed to her quiet mode of solving all their difficulties the one in the shape of a number of The Jupiter and the other in that of a further opinion from Sir Abraham Haphazard

 Lads said Henry turning on his heel and addressing himself to his brother but loud enough to be heard by Bold lads indeed if we re lads what does he call himself Charles James condescended to say nothing further but cocked his hat with much precision and left the visitor to the care of his youngest brother

 I have nothing further to say or to hear said the archdeacon

 He vouchsafed her no further intelligence but again seizing his hat he rushed out and took his departure for London without another word to anyone

 And then before he could let her know what had caused this sudden resolve or could point to the fatal paper which lay on the table she told him that the lawsuit was over that Bold had commissioned her to assure her father in his name that it would be abandoned that there was no further cause for misery that the whole matter might be looked on as though it had never been discussed

 In that day if he had luck he might arrange it all he might explain to Sir Abraham that he as warden would have nothing further to do with the defence about to be set up he might send in his official resignation to his friend the bishop and so make public the whole transaction that even the doctor would not be able to undo what he had done

 Popularity spoilt him for all further real use as it has done many another

 But the doctor mistook the signs of the times and the minds of men instituted himself censor of things in general and began the great task of reprobating everything and everybody without further promise of any millennium at all

 He was now this moment sitting in Tom Towers room with the object of deprecating any further articles in The Jupiter and greatly as he disliked the job his petition to that effect must be made

 It is incredible the number of evil practices he has put down it is to be feared he will soon lack subjects and that when he has made the working classes comfortable and got bitter beer put into proper sized pint bottles there will be nothing further for him left to do

 Had he dared he would on this occasion have gone elsewhere to throw the archdeacon further off the scent but he did not know what violent steps his son in law might take for his recovery if he were not found at his usual haunt and he deemed it not prudent to make himself the object of a hunt through London

 A hundred and six clauses had already been discussed and had occupied only four mornings and five evening sittings nine of the hundred and six clauses were passed fifty five were withdrawn by consent fourteen had been altered so as to mean the reverse of the original proposition eleven had been postponed for further consideration and seventeen had been directly negatived

 It was known that it would be insisted on with terrible vehemence by Protestant Irish members and as vehemently denounced by the Roman Catholic and it was justly considered that no further union between the parties would be possible after such a battle

 Under such circumstances he would not if he could help it consult anyone further till advice would be useless

 The bishop was rich but he was about to throw away the bishop s best gift and that in a manner to injure materially the patronage of the giver he could neither expect nor accept anything further from the bishop

 He was not much disturbed one young man with pale face and watery fishlike eyes wearing his hat ominously on one side did come in and stare at him and ask the girl audibly enough Who that old cock was but the annoyance went no further and the warden was left seated on his wooden bench in peace endeavouring to distinguish the different scents arising from lobsters oysters and salmon

 You need trouble yourself no further about it of course they must pay the costs and the absolute expense to you and Dr Grantly will be trifling that is compared with what it might have been if it had been continued

 and ended in expressing a strong opinion that it would be madness to raise any further question on the matter as the suit was to be nay was abandoned

 Nay my dear sir continued the attorney general there is no further ground for any question I don t see that you have the power of raising it

 When he reached the hotel he rang the bell quietly and with a palpitating heart he almost longed to escape round the corner and delay the coming storm by a further walk round St Paul s Churchyard but he heard the slow creaking shoes of the old waiter approaching and he stood his ground manfully

 At any rate you ll promise me to take no further step without consultation said the archdeacon

 What had he to do with Cox and Cummins further having already had his suit finally adjudicated upon in a court of conscience a judgment without power of appeal fully registered and the matter settled so that all the lawyers in London could not disturb it

 I must once more beseech you to take no further steps till you see my father if you owe me nothing and the archdeacon looked as though he thought a great deal were due to him at least you owe so much to my father and without waiting for a reply Dr Grantly wended his way to Cox and Cummins

 Mrs Grantly had gone out he had therefore no one to delay him by further entreaties to postpone his journey he had soon arranged his bag and paid his bill and leaving a note for his daughter in which he put the copy of his official letter he got into a cab and drove away to the station with something of triumph in his heart

 The question never occurred to him but it did occur to him that he had very little money at his banker s that he could receive nothing further from the hospital and that the sale of the furniture was his only resource

 He felt that he had left no stone unturned to arrange matters on the best and easiest footing that he had in fact so arranged them that he had so managed that there was no further need of any anxiety in the matter

 He now found it was useless to interfere any further and he should retire

 If any further assistance were required from him he would probably be called on and should be again happy to come forward

 Some gentleman will probably take my place here very soon and I strongly advise you to be prepared to receive him in a kindly spirit and to raise no further question among yourselves as to the amount of his income

 It s something very like learning geography thought Alice as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of being able to see a little further

 Further on in the wood down there they ve got no names however go on with your list of insects you re wasting time

 I ll tell you if you ll move a little further on the Fawn said

 The prettiest are always further she said at last with a sigh at the obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off as with flushed cheeks and dripping hair and hands she scrambled back into her place and began to arrange her new found treasures

 The egg seems to get further away the more I walk towards it

 It gets easier further on Humpty Dumpty replied

 Alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again but as he never opened his eyes or took any further notice of her she said Good bye once more and getting no answer to this she quietly walked away but she couldn t help saying to herself as she went Of all the unsatisfactory she repeated this aloud as it was a great comfort to have such a long word to say of all the unsatisfactory people I EVER met She never finished the sentence for at this moment a heavy crash shook the forest from end to end

 What an idea Would you be good enough Alice panted out after running a little further to stop a minute just to get one s breath again I m GOOD enough the King said only I m not strong enough

 Shakespeare had a finer conception of form but even he was contented to take all his ancient history from North s translation of Plutarch and dramatise his subject without further inquiry

 Indeed Jonson went further when he came to revise his plays for collected publication in his folio of he transferred the scene of Every Man in His Humour from Florence to London also converting Signior Lorenzo di Pazzi to Old Kno well Prospero to Master Welborn and Hesperida to Dame Kitely dwelling i the Old Jewry

 It included all the plays mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs excepting The Case is Altered the masques some fifteen that date between and another collection of lyrics and occasional poetry called Underwoods including some further entertainments a translation of Horace s Art of Poetry also published in a vicesimo quarto in and certain fragments and ingatherings which the poet would hardly have included himself

 Anything to keep this fellow from further impertinences And I say don t you think you d better suggest at the same time that the men should smoke Even these ladies are not above a cigarette some of them

 Any address where letters might be sent at once in Paris For the next ten days or till further notice H tel des Deux Mondes Avenue de l Op ra

 Moreover C sarine further inflamed her desire by gently hinting a fact which she had picked up at the courier s table d h te at the hotel that the Count had been far from anxious to sell his ancestral and historical estate to a South African diamond king

 When that was done if the process stood the test further concealment would be absolutely futile

 Charles had further provided himself with two thousand pounds in notes of the Bank of France in order that the payment might be duly made and no doubt arise as to the crime having been perpetrated as well as meditated in the former case the penalty would be fifteen years in the latter three only

 Besides the extra knowledge of your movements which I have acquired in your house has helped still further to give me various holds upon you

 It appears to me you entirely misunderstand the position and duties of a private secretary The oddest part of it all however was this that Charles being convinced Forbes Gaskell though he wasn t Colonel Clay had been fraudulently salting the rocks with gold with intent to deceive took no further notice of the alleged discoveries

 Further to secure his incog

 Being an idle young dog with a taste for amusement he got for the time no further than Paris

 And the result of our investigations appeared to be as Charles further remarked that the Sabeans who so troubled the sons of Job seemed to have migrated in a body to Kansas and Nebraska and that several thousand head of cattle seemed mysteriously to vanish la Colonel Clay into the pure air of the prairies just before each branding

 We found it possible on further confabulation by the simple aid of a pair of scissors so to cut each in two that all trace of Amelia and Isabel was obliterated

 Still it flitted across my mind at the time that the Seer had made some casual remarks at Nice about a letter in Charles s pocket presumably from Madame Picardet and I reflected further that Madame Picardet in turn might possibly hold certain answers of Charles s couched in such terms as he might reasonably desire to conceal from Amelia

 He did not even allude to the little matter of the ten per cent commission further than to say at dinner that evening that all men were bound to protect their own interests as secretaries or as principals

 He further elicited the fact that the portrait of the Count von Lebenstein was really taken from Dr

 Jane smiled at them good naturedly sat down at the piano a Bechstein grand glanced at the festoons of white roses and the cross of crimson ramblers then without further preliminaries struck the opening chord and commenced to sing

 She did not know how he got there for as she turned to leave the room she had seen his sleek head close to Myra Ingleby s on the further side of the duchess s crowd

 Jane had seated herself sideways turning towards him her back to an old stone lion mounting guard upon the parapet but she turned her head still further to look down upon the lake and she thought Garth was looking in the same direction

 Jane pushed the heavy door further open and even at that moment it occurred to her that the freckled boy with a red head and Garth s slim proportions had evidently passed easily through an aperture which refused ingress to her more massive figure

 She pushed the door further open and went in

 He vaulted over a gate to expostulate and to save the little creature from further suffering

 So she telegraphed to Deryck from Paris and at present her mind saw no further than Wimpole Street

 Poor Jane has got no further than hearing from his own lips that she is the very last person in the whole world he would wish should come near him in his blindness

 Moreover latest investigations have proved that the Israelites could not have crossed at the place you mention but further north at the Bitter Lakes a mere matter of detail in no way affecting the extreme appositeness of your illustration rather adding to it for I fear there are bitter waters ahead of you my poor girl

 Yes of course without further comment helped Garth to add I couldn t even have Miss Gray with me

 After a few moments of further silence steeped in the silver moonlight of reminiscence for Garth occupied by the doctor in a rapid piecing in of Jane s version the sad young voice continued I thought she understood completely

 How accurately you judge distance he remarked backing with Jane towards the further trunk

 On an easel near the further window stood an unfinished painting palette and brushes beside it just as Garth had left them when he went out on that morning nearly three months ago and vaulting over a gate to protect a little animal from unnecessary pain was plunged himself into such utter loss and anguish

 In a further corner partly concealed by a Cairo screen stood another pile

 A little judicious questioning drew forth further stories of the duchess and her pets and Miss Champion s name came in with a frequency which they both enjoyed

 WILL AWAIT FURTHER ORDERS AT ABERDEEN

 You have never seen me on a day when something was going to happen said Garth and Nurse Rosemary made no further attempt to repress him

 You need not describe it further

 Garth waited without further word

 I have no further right to criticise them

 Each hour a pearl Jane got no further

 Frankly had I been the King the further they had gone the better should I have been pleased

 A mere stranger could have seen that he hated me and hated worse to see me with Princess Flavia yet I am persuaded that he tried to conceal both feelings and further that he tried to persuade me that he believed I was verily the King

 These are the tales told by the Persians and the Phenicians severally and concerning these things I am not going to say that they happened thus or thus a but when I have pointed to the man who first within my own knowledge began to commit wrong against the Hellenes I shall go forward further with the story giving an account of the cities of men small as well as great for those which in old times were great have for the most part become small while those that were in my own time great used in former times to be small so then since I know that human prosperity never continues steadfast I shall make mention of both indifferently

 For a time then Gyges was amazed at these words and afterwards he began to entreat her that she would not bind him by necessity to make such a choice then however as he could not prevail with her but saw that necessity was in truth set before him either to slay his master or to be himself slain by others he made the choice to live himself and he inquired further as follows Since thou dost compel me to take my master s life against my own will let me hear from thee also what is the manner in which we shall lay hands upon him

 So when Solon had moved Cr sus to inquire further by the story of Tellos recounting how many points of happiness he had the king asked again whom he had seen proper to be placed next after this man supposing that he himself would certainly obtain at least the second place but he replied Cleobis and Biton for these who were of Argos by race possessed a sufficiency of wealth and in addition to this strength of body such as I shall tell

 Thus they made request and Cr sus calling to mind the words of the dream spoke to them as follows As touching my son make no further mention of him in this matter for I will not send him with you seeing that he is newly married and is concerned now with the affairs of his marriage but I will send with you chosen men of the Lydians and the whole number of my hunting dogs and I will give command to those who go to be as zealous as may be in helping you to destroy the wild beast out of your land

 And Peisistratos having accepted the proposal and made an agreement on these terms they contrived with a view to his return a device the most simple by far as I think that ever was practised considering at least that it was devised at a time when the Hellenic race had been long marked off from the Barbarian as more skilful and further removed from foolish simplicity and among the Athenians who are accounted the first of the Hellenes in ability

 And as to the oracle which was given Cr sus finds fault with good ground for Loxias told him beforehand that if he should march upon the Persians he should destroy a great empire and he upon hearing this if he wished to take counsel well ought to have sent and asked further whether the god meant his own empire or that of Cyrus but as he did not comprehend that which was uttered and did not ask again let him pronounce himself to be the cause of that which followed

 Thence they went on to invade Egypt and when they were in Syria which is called Palestine Psammetichos king of Egypt met them and by gifts and entreaties he turned them from their purpose so that they should not advance any further and as they retreated when they came to the city of Ascalon in Syria most of the Scythians passed through without doing any damage but a few of them who had stayed behind plundered the temple of Aphrodite Urania

 further away from the Euxine eastwards

 As regards Egypt then I both believe those who say that things are so and for myself also I am strongly of opinion that they are so because I have observed that Egypt runs out into the sea further than the adjoining land and that shells are found upon the mountains of it and an efflorescence of salt forms upon the surface so that even the pyramids are being eaten away by it and moreover that of all the mountains of Egypt the range which lies above Memphis is the only one which has sand besides which I notice that Egypt resembles neither the land of Arabia which borders upon it nor Libya nor yet Syria for they are Syrians who dwell in the parts of Arabia lying along the sea but that it has soil which is black and easily breaks up seeing that it is in truth mud and silt brought down from Ethiopia by the river but the soil of Libya we know is reddish in colour and rather sandy while that of Arabia and Syria is somewhat clayey and rocky

 He the priests said first of all set out with ships of war from the Arabian gulf and subdued those who dwelt by the shores of the Erythraian Sea until as he sailed he came to a sea which could no further be navigated by reason of shoals then secondly after he had returned to Egypt according to the report of the priests he took a great army and marched over the continent subduing every nation which stood in his way and those of them whom he found valiant and fighting desperately for their freedom in their lands he set up pillars which told by inscriptions his own name and the name of his country and how he had subdued them by his power but as to those of whose cities he obtained possession without fighting or with ease on their pillars he inscribed words after the same tenor as he did for the nations which had shown themselves courageous and in addition he drew upon them the hidden parts of a woman desiring to signify by this that the people were cowards and effeminate

 Now the men of Sa s buried all those of this district who had been kings within the temple for the tomb of Amasis also though it is further from the sanctuary than that of Apries and his forefathers yet this too is within the court of the temple and it consists of a colonnade of stone of great size with pillars carved to imitate date palms and otherwise sumptuously adorned and within the colonnade are double doors and inside the doors a sepulchral chamber

 It is said however that Amasis even when he was in a private station was a lover of drinking and of jesting and not at all seriously disposed and whenever his means of livelihood failed him through his drinking and luxurious living he would go about and steal and they from whom he stole would charge him with having their property and when he denied it would bring him before the judgment of an Oracle whenever there was one in their place and many times he was convicted by the Oracles and many times he was absolved and then when finally he became king he did as follows as many of the gods as had absolved him and pronounced him not to be a thief to their temples he paid no regard nor gave anything for the further adornment of them nor even visited them to offer sacrifice considering them to be worth nothing and to possess lying Oracles but as many as had convicted him of being a thief to these he paid very great regard considering them to be truly gods and to present Oracles which did not lie

 This lies by the side of the entrance to the temple for within the temple they did not draw it because as it said while the house was being drawn along the chief artificer of it groaned aloud seeing that much time had been spent and he was wearied by the work and Amasis took it to heart as a warning and did not allow them to draw it further onwards

 Now some say that those of the Samians who were sent away by Polycrates never reached Egypt but when they arrived on their voyage at Carpathos they considered with themselves and resolved not to sail on any further others say that they reached Egypt and being kept under guard there they made their escape from thence

 So Periander said that it could not be but that he had suggested to them something and urged him further with questions and he after that remembered and told of this also

 These tribes of Indians dwell further off than the Persian power extends and towards the South Wind and they never became subjects of Dareios

 Midday however has about equal degree of heat with the Indians as with other men while after midday their sun becomes like the morning sun with other men and after this as it goes further away it produces still greater coolness until at last at sunset it makes the air very cool indeed

 Thus it is in this case whereas the lioness which is the strongest and most courageous of creatures produces one cub once only in her life for when she produces young she casts out her womb together with her young and the cause of it is this when the cub being within the mother begins to move about then having claws by far sharper than those of any other beast he tears the womb and as he grows larger he proceeds much further in his scratching at last the time of birth approaches and there is now nothing at all left of it in a sound condition

 Not long time after this another thing came to pass which was this Atossa the daughter of Cyrus and wife of Dareios had a tumour upon her breast which afterwards burst and then was spreading further and so long as it was not large she concealed it and said nothing to anybody because she was ashamed but afterwards when she was in evil case she sent for Demokedes and showed it to him and he said that he would make her well and caused her to swear that she would surely do for him in return that which he should ask of her and he would ask he said none of such things as are shameful

 This much however Demokedes gave them as a charge when they were putting forth to sea bidding them say to Dareios that Demokedes was betrothed to the daughter of Milon for the wrestler Milon had a great name at the king s court and I suppose that Demokedes was urgent for this marriage spending much money to further it in order that Dareios might see that he was held in honour also in his own country

 But as to the upper parts which lie on the North side of those who dwell above this land they say one can neither see nor pass through any further by reason of feathers which are poured down for both the earth and the air are full of feathers and this is that which shuts off the view

 Now of the land about which this account has been begun no one knows precisely what lies beyond it for I am not able to hear of any one who alleges that he knows as an eye witness and even Aristeas the man of whom I was making mention just now even he I say did not allege although he was composing verse that he went further than the Issedonians but that which is beyond them he spoke of by hearsay and reported that it was the Issedonians who said these things

 As to the feathers of which the Scythians say that the air is full and that by reason of them they are not able either to see or to pass through the further parts of the continent the opinion which I have is this in the parts beyond this land it snows continually though less in summer than in winter as might be supposed

 Now whomsoever has seen close at hand snow falling thickly knows what I mean without further explanation for the snow is like feathers and on account of this wintry weather being such as I have said the Northern parts of this continent are uninhabitable

 And the cause he said why he had not completely sailed round Libya was that the ship could not advance any further but stuck fast

 Having done so they continued to follow on further in the tracks of the enemy until they had passed through the whole of this land and had arrived at the desert

 The Agathyrsians then having given this warning came out in arms to their borders meaning to drive off those who were coming upon them but the Melanchlainoi and Androphagoi and Neuroi when the Persians and Scythians together invaded them did not betake themselves to brave defence but forgot their former threat and fled in confusion ever further towards the North to the desert region

 The Theraians meanwhile when they arrived at Thera after having left Corobios in the island reported that they had colonised an island on the coast of Libya and the men of Thera resolved to send one of every two brothers selected by lot and men besides taken from all the regions of the island which are seven in number and further that Battos should be both their leader and their king

 Then as they were suffering hardship for a long time and many were falling on both sides and especially on that of the Persians Amasis the commander of the land army contrived as follows perceiving that the Barcaians were not to be conquered by force but might be conquered by guile he dug by night a broad trench and over it he laid timber of no great strength and brought earth and laid it above on the top of the timber making it level with the rest of the ground then at daybreak he invited the men of Barca to a parley and they gladly consented and at last they agreed to make a treaty and the treaty they made with one another was taken over the hidden trench namely that so long as this earth should continue to be as it was so long the oath should remain firm and that the men of Barca should promise to pay tribute of due amount to the king and the Persians should do no further violence to the men of Barca

 Further to say a word concerning the intellect and the will which we attribute to God if intellect and will appertain to the eternal essence of God we must take these words in some significance quite different from those they usually bear

 Further besides God there can be no substance by Prop

 Further by the attributes of God we must understand that which by Def

 Further in Prop

 Further the modes of the divine nature follow therefrom necessarily and not contingently Prop

 Further God is not only the cause of these modes in so far as they simply exist by Prop

 Note Before going any further I wish here to explain what we should understand by nature viewed as active natura naturans and nature viewed as passive natura naturata 

 But for the sake of my opponents I will show further that although it be granted that will pertains to the essence of God it nevertheless follows from his perfection that things could not have been by him created other than they are or in a different order this is easily proved if we reflect on what our opponents themselves concede namely that it depends solely on the decree and will of God that each thing is what it is

 Further that all the decrees of God have been ratified from all eternity by God himself

 Further all the philosophers whom I have read admit that God s intellect is entirely actual and not at all potential as they also admit that God s intellect and God s will and God s essence are identical it follows that if God had had a different actual intellect and a different will his essence would also have been different and thus as I concluded at first if things had been brought into being by God in a different way from that which has obtained God s intellect and will that is as is admitted his essence would perforce have been different which is absurd

 I have further where occasion afforded taken care to remove the prejudices which might impede the comprehension of my demonstrations

 Thus it comes to pass that they only look for a knowledge of the final causes of events and when these are learned they are content as having no cause for further doubt

 Further as they find in themselves and outside themselves many means which assist them not a little in the search for what is useful for instance eyes for seeing teeth for chewing herbs and animals for yielding food the sun for giving light the sea for breeding fish c

 Further this doctrine does away with the perfection of God for if God acts for an object he necessarily desires something which he lacks

 They are unable to point to anything prior to creation except God himself as an object for which God should act and are therefore driven to admit as they clearly must that God lacked those things for whose attainment he created means and further that he desired them

 Further they were bound to form abstract notions for the explanation of the nature of things such as goodness badness order confusion warmth cold beauty deformity and so on and from the belief that they are free agents arose the further notions of praise and blame sin and merit

 Further as things which are easily imagined are more pleasing to us men prefer order to confusion as though there were any order in nature except in relation to our imagination and say that God has created all things in order thus without knowing it attributing imagination to God unless indeed they would have it that God foresaw human imagination and arranged everything so that it should be most easily imagined

 I need not further enumerate because this is not the place to treat the subject at length and also because the fact is sufficiently well known

 Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy Till cheering up her senses sore dismay d She tells them tis a causeless fantasy And childish error that they are afraid Bids them leave quaking bids them fear no more And with that word she spied the hunted boar Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red Like milk and blood being mingled both together A second fear through all her sinews spread Which madly hurries her she knows not whither This way she runs and now she will no further But back retires to rate the boar for murther

 Notice further that in attributing to the vague and so to speak objectified consciousness of a universal reason the first revelation of Divinity we assume absolutely nothing concerning even the reality or non reality of God

 Liebig confesses that it is IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MIND to conceive of particles absolutely indivisible he recognizes further that the FACT of this indivisibility is not proved but he adds that science cannot dispense with this hypothesis so that by the confession of its teachers chemistry has for its point of departure a fiction as repugnant to the mind as it is foreign to experience

 Why need I insist further The hypothesis of God is allowable for it forces itself upon every man in spite of himself no one then can take exception to it

 When the astronomer to explain the system of the world judging solely from appearance supposes with the vulgar the sky arched the earth flat the sun much like a football describing a curve in the air from east to west he supposes the infallibility of the senses reserving the right to rectify subsequently after further observation the data with which he is obliged to start

 Listen further

 But among so many competitors no one having been deemed worthy of the prize the Academy has withdrawn the question alleging as a reason the incapacity of the competitors but in reality because the failure of the contest being the sole object that the Academy had in view it behooved it to declare without further delay that the hopes of the friends of association were groundless

 But both are guilty of disloyalty to science and of mutual calumny when on the one hand political economy mistaking for science its scraps of theory denies the possibility of further progress and when socialism abandoning tradition aims at reestablishing society on undiscoverable bases

 In such a situation what is the mandate of science Certainly not to halt in an arbitrary inconceivable and impossible juste milieu it is to generalize further and discover a third principle a fact a superior law which shall explain the fiction of capital and the myth of property and reconcile them with the theory which makes labor the origin of all wealth

 Further it is necessary in accordance with the principle of indemnity if not to compensate citizens at least to guarantee to them the values which they part with it is necessary in short to insure them against loss

 Like the theologians who answer metaphysical problems only by myths and allegories which always reproduce the problems but never solve them the economists reply to the questions which they ask only by relating how they were led to ask them should they conceive that it was possible to go further they would cease to be economists

 But enough of allegory the historical and descriptive method successfully employed so long as the work was one of examination only is henceforth useless after thousands of monographs and tables we are no further advanced than in the age of Xenophon and Hesiod

 This idea of value satisfies as we shall see all the conditions for it includes at once both the positive and fixed element in useful value and the variable element in exchangeable value in the second place it puts an end to the contradiction which seemed an insurmountable obstacle in the way of the determination of value further we shall show that value thus understood differs entirely from a simple juxtaposition of the two ideas of useful and exchangeable value and that it is endowed with new properties

 Finally the proportion in which each element enters into the compound is what we call value the excess remaining after the combination is NON VALUE until the addition of a certain quantity of other elements causes further combination and exchange

 But as a final result the more he labors the greater is his well being and the more idealized his luxury the further he extends his conquests over Nature the more strongly he fortifies within him the principle of life and intelligence in the exercise of which he alone finds happiness till finally the early education of the Laborer completed and order introduced into his occupations to labor with him is no longer to suffer it is to live to enjoy

 Thus value varies and the law of value is unchangeable further if value is susceptible of variation it is because it is governed by a law whose principle is essentially inconstant namely labor measured by time

 Further such a value is not the result of a compromise that is of eclecticism juste milieu or mixture it is the product of a complete fusion a product entirely new and distinct from its components just as water the product of the combination of hydrogen and oxygen is a separate body totally distinct from its elements

 There is therefore a method of recognizing the value of things that is of determining it and as this recognition or determination results from the comparison of things with each other there is further a common feature a principle by means of which we are able to DECLARE that one thing is worth more or less than or as much as another

 Further there is a day appointed for the creation of great instruments of labor it is the day when general consumption shall be able to maintain their employment that is for all these propositions are interconvertible the day when ambient labor can feed new machinery

 The idea of value socially constituted or of proportionality of values serves to explain further a how a mechanical invention notwithstanding the privilege which it temporarily creates and the disturbances which it occasions always produces in the end a general amelioration b how the value of an economical process to its discoverer can never equal the profit which it realizes for society c how by a series of oscillations between supply and demand the value of every product constantly seeks a level with cost and with the needs of consumption and consequently tends to establish itself in a fixed and positive manner d how collective production continually increasing the amount of consumable things and the day s work constantly obtaining higher and higher pay labor must leave an excess for each producer e how the amount of work to be done instead of being diminished by industrial progress ever increases in both quantity and quality that is in intensity and difficulty in all branches of industry f how social value continually eliminates fictitious values in other words how industry effects the socialization of capital and property g finally how the distribution of products growing in regularity with the strength of the mutual guarantee resulting from the constitution of value pushes society onward to equality of conditions and fortunes

 At the present moment Europe weary of war and discussion awaits a reconciling principle and it is the vague perception of this situation which induces the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences to ask What are the general facts which govern the relations of profits to wages and determine their oscillations in other words what are the most salient episodes and the most remarkable phases of the war between labor and capital If then I demonstrate that political economy with all its contradictory hypotheses and equivocal conclusions is nothing but an organization of privilege and misery I shall have proved thereby that it contains by implication the promise of an organization of labor and equality since as has been said every systematic contradiction is the announcement of a composition further I shall have fixed the bases of this composition

 those insipid writings the disgrace of our reason which have killed more men than they contain letters Further if we must believe primitive revelation social economy was the cursed science the fruit of the tree reserved for God which man was forbidden to touch Why this religious depreciation of labor if it is true as economic science already shows that labor is the father of love and the organ of happiness Why this jealousy of our advancement But if as now sufficiently appears our progress depends upon ourselves alone of what use is it to adore this phantom of divinity and what does he still ask of us through the multitude of inspired persons who pursue us with their sermons All of you Christians protestant and orthodox neo revelators charlatans and dupes listen to the first verse of the humanitarian hymn upon God s mercy In proportion as the principle of division of labor receives complete application the worker becomes weaker narrower and more dependent

 Chevalier it should find itself besieged by fifty thousand office seekers The following objection has often been made to republicans without eliciting a reply When everybody shall have the electoral privilege will the deputies do any better and will the proletariat be further advanced I ask the same question of M

 Modern philosophers after collecting and classifying their annals have been led by the nature of their labors to deal also with history then it was that they saw not without surprise that the HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY was the same thing at bottom as the PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY further that these two branches of speculation so different in appearance the history of philosophy and the philosophy of history were also only the stage representation of the concepts of metaphysics which is philosophy entire

 It is useless to insist further on indemnification by the State

 In order that such clearing of land may not become a ruinous speculation a cause of misery in other words in order that it may be possible it is necessary therefore to multiply still further our capital and machinery discover new processes and more thoroughly divide labor

 THE SCIENCE IS COMPLETE What fools we are then socialists to hunt for daylight at noonday and to protest with our lanterns in our hands against the brilliancy of these solar rays But gentlemen it is with sincere regret and profound distrust of myself that I find myself forced to ask you for further light

 Further it may be safely said that of the whole number of licensed manufacturers and merchants a fourth at most realize profits another fourth hold their own and the rest are constantly running behind in their business

 We believe further that in an assembly of stockholders will be found only carelessness caprice negligence and that a mercantile enterprise would be constantly compromised and soon ruined if it were dependent upon a deliberative commercial assembly

 Blanc admits by his hypothesis that these workshops would yield a net product and further would compete so successfully with private industry that the latter would change into national workshops

 But in all these remarks nothing further was heard of the mayor

 Later I shall show further that in addition to the profit assured it by every discovery society exercises over the privileges which it concedes whether temporarily or perpetually claims of several kinds which largely palliate the excess of certain private fortunes and the effect of which is a prompt restoration of equilibrium

 Thus an industrial enterprise which yields only interest on capital and nothing for net product is an insignificant enterprise which results only in a transformation of values without adding anything to wealth an enterprise in short which has no further reason for existence and is immediately abandoned

 In the name of their liberty of their security of their future and of the future of their children these workmen on engaging to work in the mill had to make reserves where are the letters of credit which they have delivered to the employers Where are the guarantees which they have received What millions of men have sold their arms and parted with their liberty without knowing the import of the contract they have engaged themselves upon the promise of continuous work and adequate reward they have executed with their hands what the thought of the employers had conceived they have become by this collaboration associates in the enterprise and when monopoly unable or unwilling to make further exchanges suspends its manufacture and leaves these millions of laborers without bread they are told to be RESIGNED By the new processes they have lost nine days of their labor out of ten and for reward they are pointed to the LASH OF NECESSITY flourished over them Then if they refuse to work for lower wages they are shown that they punish themselves

 Rossi will bid us observe the further fact that political economy after having MODIFIED its formula in consequence of the intervention of monopoly will have to submit to a new CORRECTIVE although its conclusions are in themselves irreproachable

 I will go further adds Say I will not fear to say that the progressive tax is the only equitable tax

 What further need have we of the dietary prescriptions of the Church Thanks to the tax the whole year is Lent to the laborer and his Easter dinner is not as good as Monseigneur s Good Friday lunch

 Suppose for a moment that the administration be charged with affixing the marks its agents will have to interpose continually in the work of manufacture as it interposes in the liquor business and the manufacture of beer further these agents whose functions seem already so intrusive and annoying deal only with taxable quantities not with exchangeable qualities

 To induce the manufacturer to frankly indicate the intrinsic composition that is the industrial and commercial value of his merchandise it is necessary to free him from the perils of competition and satisfy his monopolistic instincts can you do it It is necessary further to interest the consumer in the repression of fraud which so long as the producer is not utterly disinterested is at once impossible and contradictory

 Supposing this rate of increase to have continued up to and to this total of misdemeanors adding the cases of the criminal courts the simple matters that go no further than the police and all the offences unknown or left unpunished offences far surpassing in number so the magistrates say those which justice reaches we shall arrive at the conclusion that in one year in the city of Paris there are more infractions of the law committed than there are inhabitants

 I say further that it is just

 But when the master in his disorderly egoism has said to the servant You shall not share with me and robbed him at one stroke of labor and wages where is the necessity where the excuse Will it be necessary further in order to justify the CONCUPISCIBLE APPETITE to fall back on the IRASCIBLE APPETITE Take care in drawing back in order to justify the human being in the series of his lusts instead of saving his morality you abandon it

 Since then Christianity that is religious humanity has not been in error as to the REALITY of a fact essential in human nature a fact which it has designated by the words ORIGINAL PREVARICATION let us further interrogate Christianity humanity as to the MEANING of this fact

 We have shown further that these two faculties which exercise a necessary influence over each other are susceptible of indefinite development and improvement

 I admit further that the idea of God is the type and foundation of the principle of authority and absolutism which it is our task to destroy or at least to subordinate wherever it manifests itself in science industry public affairs

 Taking up its criticism of the divine being and applying it to man I observe That man in adoring himself as God has posited of himself an ideal contrary to his own essence and has declared himself an antagonist of the being supposed to be sovereignly perfect in short of the infinite That man consequently is in his own judgment only a false divinity since in setting up God he denies himself and that humanism is a religion as detestable as any of the theisms of ancient origin That this phenomenon of humanity taking itself for God is not explainable in the terms of humanism and requires a further interpretation

 The opened half door was opened a little further and secured at that angle for the time

 Hush Let us draw further back

 Among the first of these volunteers was Jerry Cruncher himself who modestly concealed his spiky head from the observation of Tellson s in the further corner of the mourning coach

 The man moved a little further away as soon as he could and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap feeling it mightily close and oppressive

 Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further and his pride was touched besides

 As if I was not already full to bursting He stuck the paper on a file in an ill humour and Charles Darnay awaited his further pleasure for half an hour sometimes pacing to and fro in the strong arched room sometimes resting on a stone seat in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates

 Crunches as if nothing were further from his thoughts or practice which I don t say it is wot I would humbly offer to you sir would be this

 Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to the door and there expounded her further views to them thus She will now be at home awaiting the moment of his death

 And this have I done and commanded my people what they should do after I was gone and that these plates should be handed down from one generation to another or from one prophet to another until further commandments of the Lord

 Nephi And now I Nephi make an end for I durst not speak further as yet concerning these things

 Mosiah And now the Lord said unto Alma Haste thee and get thou and this people out of this land for the Lamanites have awakened and do pursue thee therefore get thee out of this land and I will stop the Lamanites in this valley that they come no further in pursuit of this people

 But how can loue finde harbour in my brest Till I reuenge the death of my beloued Yes second loue shall further my reuenge Ile loue Horatio my Andreas freend The more to spight the prince that wrought his end And where Don Balthazar that slew my loue He shall in rigour of my iust disdaine Reape long repentance for his murderous deed For what wast els but murderous cowardise So many to oppresse one valiant knight Without respect of honour in the fight And heere he comes that murdred my delight

 The man who had made the losing trade in peanuts seemed disposed to question the boy still further probably owing to the fact that he had nothing better to do

 As no one paid any further attention to Toby he pushed back his plate arose from the table and went with a heavy heart to attend to his regular evening chores

 STUBBS AT A PARTY Toby was about to say that he did not intend to represent the matter other than it really was when a voice from behind the canvas screen arrested further conversation

 There was no time for further conversation for Mr

 Still further Monsieur de Treville gains ten thousand crowns a year he is therefore a great noble

 He then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host who accompanied him cap in hand to the gate and remounted his yellow horse which bore him without any further accident to the gate of St

 Still further in spite of sword thrusts which weaken and painful exercises which fatigue he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of revels one of the most insinuating lady s men one of the softest whisperers of interesting nothings of his day the BONNES FORTUNES of de Treville were talked of as those of M

 You will make some desirable acquaintances and from time to time you can call upon me just to tell me how you are getting on and to say whether I can be of further service to you

 Does your Majesty require anything further Speak I am ready to obey

 Reckoning still further that as long as you do me the honor to remain in my house I shall never speak to you about rent Very kind And adding to this if there be need of it meaning to offer you fifty pistoles if against all probability you should be short at the present moment

 Further this woman as if not certain of the house she was seeking lifted up her eyes to look around her stopped went backward and then returned again

 Then today madame Oh today I am no further than gratitude

 Besides the woman wore that black mantle which d Artagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the Rue de Vaugirard and on the door of the Rue de la Harpe still further the man wore the uniform of a Musketeer

 That is all very well and enough for today before we proceed further someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your wife

 de Chevreuse had been in Paris but still further that the queen had renewed with her one of those mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a CABAL when he affirmed that he the cardinal was about to unravel the most closely twisted thread of this intrigue that at the moment of arresting in the very act with all the proofs about her the queen s emissary to the exiled duchess a Musketeer had dared to interrupt the course of justice violently by falling sword in hand upon the honest men of the law charged with investigating impartially the whole affair in order to place it before the eyes of the king Louis XIII could not contain himself and he made a step toward the queen s apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when in broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty

 By day they did nothing but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel at night in addition to complines and matins they were further obliged to leap twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of their cells

 Still further he had seldom seen the young Musketeer but every time he had seen him he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance

 Still further his shirt had stuck to the wound and he had lost only a few drops of blood

 And still further it is very probable I should not have done anything of this if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone who is my lady as the queen is yours

 The result of these reflections was that d Artagnan without asking information of any kind alighted commended the horses to the care of his lackey entered a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone and desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast as possible a desire which further corroborated the high opinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight

 But still further his education had been so little neglected even with respect to scholastic studies so rare at this time among gentlemen that he smiled at the scraps of Latin which Aramis sported and which Porthos pretended to understand

 Come said d Artagnan let us inquire further

 I was hipped to death and still further upon my honor I don t like English horses

 Porthos seeing this retwisted his mustache elongated his imperial a second time and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir and who not only was a beautiful lady but still further no doubt a great lady for she had behind her a Negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the Mass

 Second Porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his thigh As the Englishman without making any further resistance then surrendered his sword Porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to his carriage

 Coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further but withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon Porthos he contented himself with saying Monsieur our cousin will do us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the campaign will he not Madame Coquenard This time Porthos received the blow right in his stomach and felt it

 And does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason The second reason Monsieur the Chevalier replied Kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself Then only d Artagnan remembered the languishing glances of Kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the soubrette

 Still further the Jew told them that if they would sell it to him as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings he would give five hundred pistoles for it

 Still further de Wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his Eminence and d Artagnan knew that while his Eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his friends

 Now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge

 The three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they should proceed any further when all at once a circle of smoke enveloped the giant of stone and a dozen balls came whistling around d Artagnan and his companions

 Still further the sea very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast destroyed every day some little vessel and the shore from the point of l Aiguillon to the trenches was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles roberges and feluccas

 Still further in Buckingham s lodging which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs strongly compromised Mme

 And while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room the cardinal without asking further information ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him

 Tell him further that I hold Montague in my power that Montague is in the Bastille that no letters were found upon him it is true but that torture may make him tell much of what he knows and even what he does not know

 When you have given the letter to Lord de Winter and he has read it you will further say to him Watch over his Grace Lord Buckingham for they wish to assassinate him

 Still further his confidence in the worthy Picard at one time so great diminished day by day

 Still further Buckingham announced to the mayor that at length the great league was about to declare itself against France and that the kingdom would be at once invaded by the English Imperial and Spanish armies

 Milady perceived a bed she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her head and her ideas but still further her complexion

 What must the mistrustful restless suspicious cardinal think of her silence the cardinal not merely her only support her only prop her only protector at present but still further the principal instrument of her future fortune and vengeance She knew him she knew that at her return from a fruitless journey it would be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment in vain to enlarge upon the sufferings she had undergone

 Lord de Winter placed him in the hands of the guards who led him while awaiting further orders to a little terrace commanding the sea and then the baron hastened to the duke s chamber

 Laporte made no further objection and read My Lord By that which since I have known you have suffered by you and for you I conjure you if you have any care for my repose to countermand those great armaments which you are preparing against France to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is the ostensible cause and of which it is generally whispered your love for me is the concealed cause

 But as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the event that is to say till two o clock in the afternoon two vessels had already left the port the one bearing as we know Milady who already anticipating the event was further confirmed in that belief by seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admiral s ship

 There was no further question therefore about Marie Michon among the four Musketeers who besides had what they wanted that was the order to withdraw Mme

 Still further Athos obtained of M

 de Treville six days instead of four and introduced into these six days two more nights for they set out on the twenty fourth at five o clock in the evening and as a further kindness M

 But he had gone farther than Athos for at the village of Festubert while drinking at an inn he had learned without needing to ask a question that the evening before at half past eight a wounded man who accompanied a lady traveling in a post chaise had been obliged to stop unable to go further

 Mexico and Peru and the West Indies were Spanish posses Two pages missing from original book here Sidenote Nobility clergy and gentry In the business of managing the Estates the problem was further simplified to the Tudors because circumstances enabled them arbitrarily to replenish their treasuries largely from sources which did not wound the susceptibilities of the Commons

 This was sufficiently decisive but the endorsement of Henry s title in the abstract was confirmed by further enactments which assumed that he had been King of right before the battle of Bosworth thus repudiating title by conquest since they attainted of treason those who had joined Richard in levying war against him

 To the former two any further acquisition of power by France was a possible menace

 Further besides some enactments for checking feudal customs which tended to disorder it was ordained that the principal castles should always be under the command of Englishmen

 Sidenote The suppression June Meantime Henry had not been idle but he saw that the insurgents were not rousing the country as they progressed and therefore he judged that the further they were drawn away from their own country the better

 in April of the next year further altered the face of international politics already changing with the final collapse of Warbeck and his disappearance as a pawn in the game

 Lewis made separate treaties with Spain and with Philip but the former remained none the less anxious on the score of a possible further rapprochement between France and England

 At any rate Suffolk was executed apparently without further trial early in the next reign

 It was therefore necessary for him not merely to buttress his hereditary claim by marrying the rival whose title was technically the strongest and securing the pronouncement of Parliament in his favour together with such adventitious sanction as a Papal Bull afforded but further to make his subjects contented with his rule

 In it would have been so but at the actual time Henry was himself the de facto monarch he had no wish to punish his predecessor s supporters further and he was really providing an inducement to his subjects to be loyal to the ruling dynasty

 While the King restrained the power of the nobility as military factors in the situation he developed his own control of military force by the revival of the militia system always theoretically in force but practically of late displaced by the baronial levies and his hands were further strengthened by the possession of the only train of artillery in the realm the value of which was markedly exemplified in the suppression of the Cornish insurgents

 This view is further borne out when we observe that in these years also his political foresight degenerates into craftiness personal animosities playing a larger part

 At the close of the adventurer s active career in the end of a treaty was made between England and Scotland which was to remain in force till a year after the death of either monarch and there were further treaties when James married Margaret Tudor in 

 There was no further prospect of keeping France and England embroiled while they appropriated the spoils

 Charles Brandon Footnote Edmund de la Pole Earl of Suffolk in the last reign and Yorkist intriguer was executed apparently without further trial in 

 The event is of further significance because Henry at present had no offspring and the young King of Scotland son of his sister Margaret was heir presumptive to the throne whereas if his younger sister Mary should have children it was certain that there would be a party to support their claim in preference to that of the Scottish monarch

 Sidenote Wolsey s success During these two years the reality of Wolsey s control of the situation was further demonstrated by his management of the Pope who refused him the office of legate after having reluctantly made him Cardinal

 Sidenote Monastic corruption Further the monastic system had utterly fallen away from its pristine ideals

 The Legate let slip that in view of the determined attitude of Henry and Wolsey he would have to await further instructions from Rome whereupon he was again threatened with the secession of England from the Roman Obedience

 Since both Francis and Charles were for the time satisfied to restrict their ambitions so as not to collide with each other there was no further demand for the Cardinal s diplomatic genius

 Sick and worn he started on his last journey towards London but was stricken with mortal illness and could travel no further than Leicester Abbey where the end came

 After another twelve month he felt it his further duty to penalise all who had submitted to the illegal authority

 It is to be observed also in a somewhat different connexion that the further visitation was accompanied by the issuing of Injunctions for the conduct of monastic establishments which may have been designed solely with a view to enforcing a pure and pious manner of living but are undoubtedly open to the suspicion of having been deliberately calculated to make the monastic life insupportable and so to encourage the religious houses to efface themselves by voluntary surrender a course which was not infrequently adopted

 Being arrested he maintained in spite of earnest efforts to persuade him to recant the Zwinglian doctrine of the Lord s Supper but further he stood almost alone in declaring that to hold a correct opinion on this point of doctrine could not be essential to salvation

 Further the English quarrel with Rome was being embittered by a campaign against spurious relics miracle working shrines and the like involving a particularly virulent attack on St

 But he wished to carry still further the anti clericalism which was part of his policy

 His loyalty was as unfailing as it was unscrupulous his work had been thorough and complete the King was placed beyond further need of him

 By his efforts the personal power of the crown became irresistible and as the old King raised England from being almost a negligible quantity on the Continent to become at the lowest an effective make weight in European combinations so Wolsey raised her still further to a position of equality with the two great Powers which overshadowed all the rest

 in the direction of raising England s international prestige so it was also in the concentration of power in the hands of the sovereign and the process was carried still further though in a somewhat different way when Wolsey had fallen

 Sidenote The Land The economic troubles brought about mainly by the new agricultural conditions in the reign of the first Tudor were exaggerated in that of the second and were further intensified by the dissolution of the Monasteries

 This depreciation added to the debasement further increased the rise of prices

 Sidenote Somerset s Scottish policy But Somerset did not conciliate France which had recently been further irritated by the construction of so called harbour works at Boulogne which were evidently intended to be fortified contrary to the treaty while in Scotland he was meditating a step which could only drive that country into the arms of France

 More significant was a further proclamation for the destruction of images in which the distinction between abused images and others previously laid down was cancelled

 He was driving the country faster than it was prepared to go in the direction of religious innovations he was attacking the privileges which the new landowners had usurped his Scottish policy had been upset in spite of Pinkie by the young Queen s escape to France he was further alienating all but a few of the nobility by his increasing arrogance of demeanour and disregard of advice as well as by an assumption of powers which had no precedent he was giving a handle to his enemies by the profusion of his own household his appropriations of clerical lands and even of the fabric of consecrated buildings to his own use and finally his conduct of foreign affairs had been so incompetent that while the Emperor declined an English alliance the position of Boulogne which remained quite inefficiently garrisoned was becoming critical and a French squadron ostensibly in pursuit of English pirates attacked the island of Jersey

 The Archbishop had been in favour of further innovations but these had not been allowed

 A new Treasons Act further reviving some of Henry s provisions was introduced in the Upper House but rejected by the Commons who did indeed restore verbal treason but pointedly required that two witnesses at least should prove the guilt of the accused to his face with evident reference to the recent trial of Somerset

 Further he could be sure that France would go as far as diplomacy permitted to prevent the accession of Mary on account of her relationship with the Emperor to whom she had all her life looked for counsel

 Further he was endowed with a penetrating perception of character immense powers of organisation and industry which was absolutely indefatigable

 The French court was now disposed to be friendly towards Elizabeth the Guises had lost weight by the death of the Duke Philip of Spain saw nothing to gain by further embroilments so the chances of Mary s marriage either with his son or with Charles IX

 Further inasmuch as fortune had so far smiled upon Orange of late that Leyden had triumphantly resisted a determined siege Elizabeth offered friendly mediation emphasising the suggestion by a hint that unless Spain could see her way to a pacification Orange could now appeal with a prospect of success to France and England could not afford to decline the preferable alternative of an appeal to herself

 The prospect of this further accession to his dominions and increase of his power and resources made it more than ever necessary for France to hold aloof from any alliance with him in which she must play an entirely subordinate part and to court the friendship of England

 In January the insurgents were encouraged by the arrival of some military stores from abroad with promises of further assistance in response to messages from Desmond to the King of Spain

 Ministers wished to have definite provision made for carrying on the Government in case of the Queen s murder but she would go with them no further than to sanction the Association with the entirely laudable modification that the person for whose sake the deed was done should not be held ipso facto guilty of complicity

 Having heard her denial the Court was transferred from Fotheringay where it first sat to Westminster and at Westminster after further examination of the documents and of Mary s secretaries it unanimously pronounced her guilty

 In Fenton captained another expedition which seems to have been intended for Magellan but got no further than the Brazils returning after a successful engagement with some Spanish ships

 On the other hand the Armada had lost three ships several more had suffered so severely as to be useless for further action its ammunition was running short some hundreds of men had been killed or wounded and the whole fleet had realised that in manoeuvring capacity it was completely outclassed so that its morale was failing

 On Saturday evening without any further fighting the Armada anchored in Calais Roads

 A perfectly sombre bigot an example of what the Greeks would have called Greek hubris of a very exceptional kind who believed devoutly in himself as the instrument chosen by the Saints for the overthrow of heretics convinced that his aims and interests were favoured by Heaven ranking before those of the Papacy itself without a qualm as to the righteousness of all means he could adopt to further those aims

 Further she peremptorily ordered him to march against O Neill without delay warning him on no account to withdraw from the country

 Further save for Sidney and Marlowe who were both cut off prematurely and Spenser himself who died at forty six the work of all the greater Elizabethan writers Shakespeare and Ben Jonson Bacon Hooker Raleigh Middleton Drayton lies as much in the time of James as in that of Elizabeth while a whole group of those to whom the same general title is applied Beaumont and Fletcher Webster Ford Massinger belong in effect wholly to the later reign

 When a crisis was reached where there was no further use for play acting she was again the shrewd practical ruler who had merely been masked as the comedienne

 So satisfactory was her performance of this task and so modest her conduct that he made proposals of marriage declaring himself as a further inducement willing to adopt her son who he asserted would become a clever man if he were carefully brought up

 He promised not only to pay his expenses but to furnish him with a further stipend urging that While he was yet young it was fitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities which might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses

 Thus his measures instead of being fetters to his sense were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his rapture and even to give a further representation of his notions in the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified

 This consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of the same epithets to his gods and heroes such as the far darting Phoebus the blue eyed Pallas the swift footed Achilles c

 If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for the repetition I shall add a further conjecture

 For a further preservation of this air of simplicity a particular care should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet

 What I would further recommend to him is to study his author rather from his own text than from any commentaries how learned soever or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world to consider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all the ancients and with Milton above all the moderns

 Parnell though I shall take a further opportunity of doing justice to the last whose good nature to give it a great panegyric is no less extensive than his learning

 Yet hear me further when our wars are o er If safe we land on Argos fruitful shore There shall he live my son our honours share And with Orestes self divide my care

 Yet hear me further when our wars are o er If safe we land on Argos fruitful shore There shalt thou live his son his honour share And with Orestes self divide his care

 Such was his word what further he declared These sacred heralds and great Ajax heard

 While unresolved the son of Tydeus stands Pallas appears and thus her chief commands Enough my son from further slaughter cease Regard thy safety and depart in peace Haste to the ships the gotten spoils enjoy Nor tempt too far the hostile gods of Troy

 Now on the field Ulysses stands alone The Greeks all fled the Trojans pouring on But stands collected in himself and whole And questions thus his own unconquer d soul What further subterfuge what hopes remain What shame inglorious if I quit the plain What danger singly if I stand the ground My friends all scatter d all the foes around Yet wherefore doubtful let this truth suffice The brave meets danger and the coward flies

 Meantime on further methods to advise Come follow to the fleet thy new allies There hear what Greece has on her part to say

 The wary Cretan as his foe drew near Full on his throat discharged the forceful spear Beneath the chin the point was seen to glide And glitter d extant at the further side

 Raging he spoke nor further wastes his breath But turns his javelin to the work of death

 He agrees to it but at the same time charges him to content himself with rescuing the fleet without further pursuit of the enemy

 The fleet once saved desist from further chase Nor lead to Ilion s walls the Grecian race Some adverse god thy rashness may destroy Some god like Phoebus ever kind to Troy

 If yet thou further seek to learn my birth A tale resounded through the spacious earth Hear how the glorious origin we prove From ancient Dardanus the first from Jove Dardania s walls he raised for Ilion then The city since of many languaged men Was not

 No further subterfuge no further chance Tis Pallas Pallas gives thee to my lance

 It is fancifully supposed that the name was derived from myrmaex an ant because they imitated the diligence of the ants and like them were indefatigable continually employed in cultivating the earth the change from ants to men is founded merely on the equivocation of their name which resembles that of the ant they bore a further resemblance to these little animals in that instead of inhabiting towns or villages at first they commonly resided in the open fields having no other retreats but dens and the cavities of trees until Ithacus brought them together and settled them in more secure and comfortable habitations

 Quintus Calaber goes still further in his account of the service rendered to Jove by Thetis Nay more the fetters of Almighty Jove She loosed Dyce s Calaber s

 Their medical renown was further prolonged in the subsequent poem of Arktinus the Iliou Persis wherein the one was represented as unrivalled in surgical operations the other as sagacious in detecting and appreciating morbid symptoms

 A certain interval is allowed them for reaching the appointed scene of action which interval is dramatised as it were either by a temporary continuation of the previous narrative or by fixing attention for a while on some new transaction at the close of which the further account of the mission is resumed

 A similar bond of connexion in the military details of the narrative is the decree issued by Jupiter at the commencement of the eighth book against any further interference of the gods in the battles

 Here it is clear from both speakers that although Sarpedon is said to be fated to die Jupiter might still if he pleased save him and place him entirely out of the reach of any such event and further in the alternative that Jupiter himself would destroy him by the hands of another

 Aid from the Duke of Urbino never came on which as it is not my business I will make no further comment

 However I will not enlarge upon it further only adding that I was within an inch of revenging my father on Messer Jacopo Salviati who had grievously injured him according to my father s complaints

 On my arrival I asked to see the Duke who told me that if I was alone I need only keep quiet and have no further anxiety but to go on working at the jewel which the Pope had set his heart on and stay eight days indoors

 The bestial manners of the man made me a beast too and I retorted Monsignor send me to the galleys when I ve done deeds worthy of them but for my present laches I snap my fingers at your galleys and what is more I tell you that just because of you I will not set hand further to my piece

 This did not however happen to me wherefore I thought that I had made a very good bargain when they placed me in that hideous dungeon I have spoken of where Fra Foiano died of hunger and left me there without doing me further injury

 At this juncture the invisible being who had diverted me from my intention of suicide came to me being still invisible but with a clear voice and shook me and made me rise and said to me Ah me my Benvenuto quick quick betake thyself to God with thy accustomed prayers and cry out loudly loudly In a sudden consternation I fell upon my knees and recited several of my prayers in a loud voice after this I said Qui habitat in adjutorio then I communed a space with God and in an instant the same clear and open voice said to me Go to rest and have no further fear The meaning of this was that the castellan after giving the most cruel orders for my death suddenly countermanded them and said Is not this Benvenuto the man whom I have so warmly defended whom I know of a surety to be innocent and who has been so greatly wronged Oh how will God have mercy on me and my sins if I do not pardon those who have done me the greatest injuries Oh why should I injure a man both worthy and innocent who has only done me services and honour Go to instead of killing him I give him life and liberty and in my will I ll have it written that none shall demand of him the heavy debt for his expenses here which he would elsewise have to pay

 I retorted that the sons of my art travelled in the way I had informed him and that not being a duke s son I knew nothing about the customs of such folk if he treated me to language with which my ears were unfamiliar I would not go at all the Cardinal having broken faith with me and such scurvy words having been spoken I should make my mind up once for all to take no further trouble with the Ferrarese

 Then putting my foot in the stirrup in his presence I set off upon my travels without further leave taking

 The poor fellows swallowed my words and chewed the cud of them then they went home without further argument

 Well after the deed was done he came to find me and I said to him I am the least of all Italians in Italy and yet I have done nothing to you in comparison with what I have the heart to do and will do if you utter a single further word adding other terms of menace and abuse

 The King laughed at the matter and made me out new letters patent to secure me from further molestation

 I shall pass this matter over without further words since it has nothing to do with the plan of my Memoirs

 The letter contained many further particulars worthy of the King s attention and proper to the preservation of my honour

 Now grant me my permission prince I ask no further reward for my labours up to this time than the gracious favour of your most illustrious Excellency

 After I had thus expounded these convincing arguments together with many more of the same kind which it would be tedious to set down here the Duke shook his head and departed without further ceremony

 On further thinking I recollected how often that wife of Sbietta had teased me in a hundred ways to partake more freely of the sauce

 Hyde s motion was therefore no further pressed and the debate on the general question was adjourned till the next day

 Their opinion was that during many years the country had been grievously misgoverned and that a great reform had been necessary but that a great reform had been made that the grievances of the nation had been fully redressed that sufficient vengeance had been exacted for the past that sufficient security had been provided for the future and that it would therefore be both ungrateful and unwise to make any further attacks on the royal prerogative

 If these words mean anything they must mean that the opinions of Sir James Mackintosh concerning religious liberty and parliamentary reform went no further than those of the authors of the Revolution in other words that Sir James Mackintosh opposed Catholic Emancipation and approved of the old constitution of the House of Commons

 At the Restoration it had attained such a point that it could go no further

 They might probably have been induced to go further and to restore the High Commission and the Star Chamber

 The glory of being further behind the age than any other portion of the British people is one which that learned body acquired early and has never lost

 The editor of Mackintosh s Fragments assures us that the standard of James bore the nobler inscription and so forth the meaning of which is that William and the other authors of the Revolution were vile Whigs who drove out James from being a Radical that the crime of the King was his going further in liberality than his subjects that he was the real champion of freedom and that Somers Locke Newton and other narrow minded people of the same sort were the real bigots and oppressors

 He struck out of the list of criminals the names of those over whom prosecutions had been long impending where nothing further was intended by the informers than to gratify their own malice by seeing their enemies humiliated laying it down as a rule that if any one chose to renew a prosecution he should incur the risk of the punishment which he sought to inflict

 The extreme cruelty likewise which had been exercised during the last two reigns afforded a further motive for relinquishing all attempts in favour of liberty as they might be severely revenged upon themselves by the subsequent emperor and it was a degree of moderation in Claudius which palliates the injustice of his cause that he began his government with an act of amnesty respecting the public transactions which ensued upon the death of Caligula

 One is tempted further to maintain that an advance in civilization must imply an advance in moralization

 Their lives do not help to further but serve to frustrate the ends approved by the social will

 It is not unnatural that some thoughtful intuitionists dissatisfied with a considerable number of independent moral principles should aim at a further simplification

 The common opinion of mankind is not at fault in basing upon the distinction between selves the further distinction between egoism and altruism

 Thus the Cyrenaics saw in the fact that we are from our childhood attracted to pleasure and when we have attained it seek no further a proof that pleasure is the chief good

 Paley maintains that when it has been pointed out that private happiness has been the motive of an act no further question can reasonably be asked

 The confessed egoist only goes a step further in recognizing it as a principle that has no rival

 And that men generally are inclined to regard egoism as not unnatural seems evinced by the fact that for apparently altruistic actions they are very apt to seek ulterior egoistic motives while if the action seems plainly egoistic they seek no further

 Men do desire pleasure and they undoubtedly approve the preference given to pleasures more intense enduring certain immediate fruitful in further pleasures free from painful consequences and shared by many over those which have not these characteristics Intense long certain speedy fruitful pure Such marks in pleasures and in pains endure

 Accepting it as a fact revealed by observation that the actual end of action on the part of every individual is his own happiness as he conceives it he appears to have passed on without question to the further positions that the proper end of action of the individual is his own greatest happiness and yet his proper end of action as a member of a community is the greatest happiness of the community

 We must then look further for the proof of the utilitarian principle

 It is further conceded that pleasures may be consciously aimed at but it is urged that this does not result in true self satisfaction and is evidence of the existence of unhealthy desires

 It is only by a process of development that the Actual Social Will has come to be what it is and the Rational Social Will looks to a further development under the guidance of reason

 He further maintained that civilized nations may treat as barbarians peoples who are behind them in the essential elements of the state and also that in a given epoch a given nation is dominant and other existing nations are void of right

 At all events whenever an English playwright represents a young and marriageable woman as being anything but a romantic heroine he is disposed of without further thought as an echo of Schopenhauer

 Chickenpox is an evil but if I were to declare that we must either submit to it or else repress it sternly by seizing everyone who suffers from it and punishing them by inoculation with smallpox I should be laughed at for though nobody could deny that the result would be to prevent chickenpox to some extent by making people avoid it much more carefully and to effect a further apparent prevention by making them conceal it very anxiously yet people would have sense enough to see that the deliberate propagation of smallpox was a creation of evil and must therefore be ruled out in favor of purely humane and hygienic measures

 The Christian has been like Dickens doctor in the debtor s prison who tells the newcomer of its ineffable peace and security no duns no tyrannical collectors of rates taxes and rent no importunate hopes nor exacting duties nothing but the rest and safety of having no further to fall

 Nevertheless though such is the case and though there be no further room for doubt I can scarcely believe until the fact is proved by experience that men can be induced to consider the question calmly and fairly so firmly are they convinced that it is merely at the bidding of the mind that the body is set in motion or at rest or performs a variety of actions depending solely on the mind s will or the exercise of thought

 I would further call attention to the mechanism of the human body which far surpasses in complexity all that has been put together by human art not to repeat what I have already shown namely that from nature under whatever attribute she be considered infinite results follow

 Thus an infant believes that of its own free will it desires milk an angry child believes that it freely desires to run away further a drunken man believes that he utters from the free decision of his mind words which when he is sober he would willingly have withheld thus too a delirious man a garrulous woman a child and others of like complexion believe that they speak from the free decision of their mind when they are in reality unable to restrain their impulse to talk

 Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason that men believe themselves to be free simply because they are conscious of their actions and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined and further it is plain that the dictates of the mind are but another name for the appetites and therefore vary according to the varying state of the body

 Further between appetite and desire there is no difference except that the term desire is generally applied to men in so far as they are conscious of their appetite and may accordingly be thus defined Desire is appetite with consciousness thereof

 Further the emotion of pleasure in reference to the body and mind together I shall call stimulation titillatio or merriment hilaritas the emotion of pain in the same relation I shall call suffering or melancholy

 But before I go further I should like here to explain at greater length Prop

 We further see that he who loves necessarily endeavours to have and to keep present to him the object of his love while he who hates endeavours to remove and destroy the object of his hatred

 note in so far as we imagine it with this emotion we shall hate it further inasmuch as we conceive that it has some point of resemblance to something else which is wont to affect us with an equally strong emotion of pleasure we shall with an equally strong impulse of pleasure love it III

 Further in so far as a thing is affected with pain it is to that extent destroyed the extent being in proportion to the amount of pain III

 We must further remark that we not only feel pity for a thing which we have loved as shown in III

 Further we see that from the same property of human nature whence it follows that men are merciful it follows also that they are envious and ambitious

 Further this hatred towards the object of love will be greater in proportion to the pleasure which the jealous man had been wont to derive from the reciprocated love of the said object and also in proportion to the feelings he had previously entertained towards his rival

 note increases or aids a man s power of activity it may easily be shown in like manner that a man affected by pleasure has no desire further than to preserve it and his desire will be in proportion to the magnitude of the pleasure

 It follows further from III

 Further in so far as we hope for or fear anything we regard it with love or hatred thus everyone can apply by himself to hope and fear what we have said concerning love and hatred

 For instance I shall call a man intrepid if he despises an evil which I am accustomed to fear if I further take into consideration that in his desire to injure his enemies and to benefit those whom he loves he is not restrained by the fear of an evil which is sufficient to restrain me I shall call him daring

 Again a man will appear timid to me if he fears an evil which I am accustomed to despise and if I further take into consideration that his desire is restrained by the fear of an evil which is not sufficient to restrain me I shall say that he is cowardly and in like manner will everyone pass judgment

 Thus though there is a great difference between various emotions of love hatred or desire for instance between love felt towards children and love felt towards a wife there is no need for us to take cognizance of such differences or to track out further the nature and origin of the emotions

 of this part that desire is appetite with consciousness thereof further that appetite is the essence of man in so far as it is determined to act in a way tending to promote its own persistence

 I say further whereby the mind affirms concerning its body or any part thereof a force for existence greater than before

 So she went away and returning to Mus ab said I have seen her and her face is fairer than health she hath large and well opened eyes and under them a nose straight and smooth as a cane oval cheeks and a mouth like a cleft pomegranate a neck as a silver ewer and below it a bosom with two breasts like twin pomegranates and further down a slim waist and a slender stomach with a navel therein as it were a casket of ivory and back parts like a hummock of sand and plumply rounded thighs and calves like columns of alabaster but I saw her feet to be large and thou wilt fall short with her in time of need

 Why in spring and summer Because time is pressing and man s skill is of no further avail

 But why wait until time is pressing and man s skill of no further avail Because to pray for rain is the same thing as asking a favour and the ancients did not lightly ask favours

 The literati however whom the First Emperor had persecuted by forbidding any further study of the Confucian Canon and burning all the copies he could lay hands on gave out that he had been prevented from performing the sacrifices by a violent storm of rain alleging as a reason that he was altogether deficient in the virtue required for such a ceremony

 It can further be shown not only that dead men never become spirits but also that they are without consciousness by the fact that before birth they are without consciousness

 They adopted the idea of a Trinity consisting of Lao Tzu P an Ku and the Ruler of the Universe and they further appropriated the Buddhist Purgatory with all its frightful terrors and tortures after death

 Why then my dear says he we have no time to talk further now

 I hope my warm sisters will be answered now and blush a little if not I have no more to say till I hear further

 It concerns the story in hand very little to enter into the further particulars of the family or of myself for the five years that I lived with this husband only to observe that I had two children by him and that at the end of five years he died

 I told him for his fair means and his foul they were equally contemned by me that for my going to England I was resolved on it come what would and that as to treating him not like a husband and not showing myself a mother to my children there might be something more in it than he understood at present but for his further consideration I thought fit to tell him thus much that he neither was my lawful husband nor they lawful children and that I had reason to regard neither of them more than I did

 This was the most provoking thing he could have said to me for I really wanted his further importunities that I might be prevailed with to bring out that which indeed it was like death to me to conceal so I answered him plainly that I could not say I was glad not to be importuned thought I could not tell how to comply

 And indeed I had a great deal of reason to say so of him too for though we lodged both on a floor and he had frequently come into my chamber even when I was in bed and I also into his when he was in bed yet he never offered anything to me further than a kiss or so much as solicited me to anything till long after as you shall hear

 I told him if those were all his objections I would soon remove them and convince him that there was not the least room for any difficulty for that first as for suspecting him if ever I should do it now is the time to suspect him and not put the trust into his hands and whenever I did suspect him he could but throw it up then and refuse to go any further

 I could bring him to nothing further than this

 It might perhaps be carried further than was needful but it was an error of the right hand if it was an error for by this she kept up the reputation such as it was of her business and obtained this character that though she did take care of the women when they were debauched yet she was not instrumental to their being debauched at all and yet it was a wicked trade she drove too

 However he said that he was extremely afflicted at it and had no view of any satisfaction left in his world but only in the hope that I would come and relieve him by my company and then he pressed me violently indeed to give him some hopes that I would at least come up to town and let him see me when he would further enter into discourse about it

 It was indeed a wonder the people in the house had not thrown other goods out after it and which might have fallen upon it and then I had been inevitably killed but I was reserved for further afflictions

 I say let not this surprise you for sir I do not come to make a booty of you I ask nothing of you and I assure you the woman that was with you knows nothing who you are and never shall and yet perhaps I may serve you further still for I did not come barely to let you know that I was informed of these things as if I wanted a bride to conceal them assure yourself sir said she that whatever you think fit to do or say to me it shall be all a secret as it is as much as if I were in my grave

 My governess gave him further assurances of my being a woman clear from any such thing and that he was as entirely save in that respect as he was with his own lady but as for seeing me she said it might be of dangerous consequence but however that she would talk with me and let him know my answer using at the same time some arguments to persuade him not to desire it and that it could be of no service to him seeing she hoped he had no desire to renew a correspondence with me and that on my account it was a kind of putting my life in his hands

 She insisted how it might tend to a further divulging the secret and might in the end be injurious to him entreating him not to press for it so at length he desisted

 Them I repented heartily of all my life past but that repentance yielded me no satisfaction no peace no not in the least because as I said to myself it was repenting after the power of further sinning was taken away

 He told me he did not come as ordinary of the place whose business it is to extort confessions from prisoners for private ends or for the further detecting of other offenders that his business was to move me to such freedom of discourse as might serve to disburthen my own mind and furnish him to administer comfort to me as far as was in his power and assured me that whatever I said to him should remain with him and be as much a secret as if it was known only to God and myself and that he desired to know nothing of me but as above to qualify him to apply proper advice and assistance to me and to pray to God for me

 And as soon as the minister was gone she told me she would not have me discouraged for perhaps ways and means might be found out to dispose of me in a particular way by myself of which she would talk further to me afterward

 Yet it seems they were resolved not to part with the men neither not doubting but a further evidence would at last come in and in order to this I think publication was made that such prisoners being taken any one that had been robbed by them might come to the prison and see them

 He liver here several years with her continued she and had several children by her of which the young gentleman that was with him now was one but after some time the old gentlewoman his mother talking to her of something relating to herself when she was in England and of her circumstances in England which were bad enough the daughter in law began to be very much surprised and uneasy and in short examining further into things it appeared past all contradiction that the old gentlewoman was her own mother and that consequently that son was his wife s own brother which struck the whole family with horror and put them into such confusion that it had almost ruined them all

 Further it facilitates matters when the prince having no other state is compelled to reside there in person

 The duke therefore having acquired the Romagna and beaten the Colonnesi while wishing to hold that and to advance further was hindered by two things the one his forces did not appear loyal to him the other the goodwill of France that is to say he feared that the forces of the Orsini which he was using would not stand to him that not only might they hinder him from winning more but might themselves seize what he had won and that the king might also do the same

 And speaking of the first method it will be illustrated by two examples one ancient the other modern and without entering further into the subject I consider these two examples will suffice those who may be compelled to follow them

 Further the prince is compelled to live always with the same people but he can do well without the same nobles being able to make and unmake them daily and to give or wake away authority when it pleases him

 Further the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin the country at the time when the spirits of the people are still hot and ready for the defence and therefore so much the less ought the prince to hesitate because after a time when spirits have cooled the damage is already done the ills are incurred and there is no longer any remedy and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with their prince he appearing to be under obligations to them now that their houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his defence

 I wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms

 And further I consider that a prince ought to cherish the nobles but not so as to make himself hated by the people

 Further always using religion as a plea so as to undertake greater schemes he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and clearing his kingdom of the Moors nor could there be a more admirable example nor one more rare

 Further he ought to entertain the people with festivals and spectacles at convenient seasons of the year and as every city is divided into guilds or into societies he ought to hold such bodies in esteem and associate with them sometimes and show himself an example of courtesy and liberality nevertheless always maintaining the majesty of his rank for this he must never consent to abate in anything

 For the actions of a new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an hereditary one and when they are seen to be able they gain more men and bind far tighter than ancient blood because men are attracted more by the present than by the past and when they find the present good they enjoy it and seek no further they will also make the utmost defence of a prince if he fails them not in other things

 Further than this how extraordinarily the ways of God have been manifested beyond example the sea is divided a cloud has led the way the rock has poured forth water it has rained manna everything has contributed to your greatness you ought to do the rest

 But Neri fearing to put him to death lest the people should be incensed kept him alive in order to hear further from his father concerning his intentions

 Then for his further security he raised a fortress in Lucca with the stones of the towers of those whom he had killed or hunted out of the state

 Without further opposition Pistoia passed into the hands of Castruccio who having forced the Signoria to leave the palace compelled the people to yield obedience to him making them many promises and remitting their old debts

 Many of those arguments are still heard daily in the press and on TV talk shows not indeed to end women s right to vote but as arguments against further steps towards gender equality

 And we may go much further and say that every woman in the country may already IF SHE IS DETERMINED TO DO SO obtain very much the same intellectual instruction which her own brother receives

 These are both noble and admirable means to work with provided we still look above and beyond them for a further development of the race for fullness of MORAL CIVILIZATION

 To cherish that growth to further that higher development by all gracious and loving and generous influences is a work for which women are especially adapted

 To speak further of them is needless for they were not within the scope of the Jesuit labors

 They might if they could punish interlopers by stripping them of all they possessed unless the latter had succeeded in reaching home with the fruits of their trade in which case the outraged monopolists had no further right of redress and could not attempt it without a breaking of the public peace and exposure to the authorized vengeance of the other party

 To imagine that he recoiled or faltered would be an injustice to his Order but on two points he had gained convictions first that little progress could be made in converting these wandering hordes till they could be settled in fixed abodes and secondly that their scanty numbers their geographical position and their slight influence in the politics of the wilderness offered no flattering promise that their conversion would be fruitful in further triumphs of the Faith

 The Indians tried to persuade the Jesuits to put them on the mission house but the priests replied that the cross before their door was a better protector and for further security they set another on their roof declaring that they would rely on it to save them from infection

 One day while at his devotions he heard an inward voice commanding him to become the founder of a new Order of hospital nuns and he was further ordered to establish on the island called Montreal in Canada a hospital or H tel Dieu to be conducted by these nuns

 But there was a further miracle

 It is needless to specify further the tortures to which they were subjected all designed to cause the greatest possible suffering without endangering life

 He dragged it into the water and covered it with stones to save it from further mutilation resolving to return alone on the following day and secretly bury it

 They then gave them food to strengthen them for further suffering

 Champfleur the commandant went out to them with urgent remonstrances and at length prevailed on them to leave their victim without further injury until Montmagny the Governor should arrive

 One of them who was defiant and abusive received a blow to silence him but no further indignity was offered to either

 Nor is it necessary to dwell further on the bloody record of inroads butcheries and tortures

 It was defended on three sides by a deep ravine and further strengthened by palisades fifteen or sixteen feet high planted under the direction of the Jesuits

 At present there was no time for further torture for there was work in hand

 Not long after he came to Canada and with a view as it was thought to some further treachery rejoined the French

 But I would have you know that you need not therefore be fearful to read further as if your reading were ever to be accompanied by sighs and tears

 Nay the evil went yet further for not merely by speech or association with the sick was the malady communicated to the healthy with consequent peril of common death but any that touched the cloth of the sick or aught else that had been touched or used by them seemed thereby to contract the disease

 So without further parley Pampinea who had a kinsman among the young men rose and approached them where they stood intently regarding them and greeting them gaily she opened to them their plan and besought them on the part of herself and her friends to join their company on terms of honourable and fraternal comradeship

 And of His mercy richly abounding to usward we have further proof herein that no keenness of mortal vision being able in any degree to penetrate the secret counsels of the Divine mind it sometimes perchance happens that in error of judgment we make one our advocate before His Majesty who is banished from His presence in eternal exile and yet He to whom nothing is hidden having regard rather to the sincerity of our prayers than to our ignorance or the banishment of the intercessor hears us no less than if the intercessor were in truth one of the blest who enjoy the light of His countenance

 The two brothers who much misdoubted Ser Ciappelletto s power to deceive the friar had taken their stand on the other side of a wooden partition which divided the room in which Ser Ciappelletto lay from another and hearkening there they readily heard and understood what Ser Ciappelletto said to the friar and at times could scarce refrain their laughter as they followed his confession and now and again they said one to another What manner of man is this whom neither age nor sickness nor fear of death on the threshold of which he now stands nor yet of God before whose judgment seat he must soon appear has been able to turn from his wicked ways that he die not even as he has lived But seeing that his confession had secured the interment of his body in church they troubled themselves no further

 And as he probed the matter still further he perceived that they were all so greedy and avaricious that human nay Christian blood and things sacred of what kind soever spiritualities no less than temporalities they bought and sold for money which traffic was greater and employed more brokers than the drapery trade and all the other trades of Paris put together open simony and gluttonous excess being glosed under such specious terms as arrangement and moderate use of creature comforts as if God could not penetrate the thoughts of even the most corrupt hearts to say nothing of the signification of words and would suffer Himself to be misled after the manner of men by the names of things

 Wherefore yielding to the dictates of prudence and honour he was now as prompt to quench as he had been inconsiderate in conceiving his unfortunate passion for the lady and fearing her answers he refrained from further jesting with her and dismissing his hopes devoted himself to his breakfast which done he disarmed suspicion of the dishonourable purpose of his visit by an early departure and thanking her for the honour she had conferred upon him and commending her to God took the road to Genoa

 And being further asked Heardest thou aught therein as to which thou art in doubt or hast thou any question to propound the good man responded Nay indeed doubt have I none of aught that I heard but rather assured faith in the verity of all

 But reverting to the point at which I started wherefrom under stress of just indignation I have deviated somewhat further than I intended I say that the said Guglielmo was had in honour and was well received by all the gentlemen of Genoa and tarrying some days in the city heard much of the meanness and avarice of Messer Ermino and was curious to see him

 This is plainly manifest by the story told by Lauretta and by mine which will be of the briefest I mean further to illustrate it seeing that good stories being always pleasurable are worth listening to with attention no matter by whom they may be told

 Wherefore that you may be on your guard against such error and further that in you be not exemplified the common proverb to wit that women do ever and on all occasions choose the worst I trust that this last of to day s stories which falls to me to tell may serve you as a lesson that as you are distinguished from others by nobility of nature so you may also shew yourselves separate from them by excellence of manners

 Thereupon the Trevisans without further parley made a rush clearing the way and crying out as they went Seize this traitor who mocks at God and His saints who being no paralytic has come hither in the guise of a paralytic to deride our patron saint and us

 Rinaldo s servant coward that he was did nothing to help his master when he saw him attacked but turned his horse s head and was off at a smart pace nor did he draw rein until he was come to Castel Guglielmo where it being now evening he put up at an inn and gave himself no further trouble

 There needed no further parley

 So one day Lamberto called his brothers to him reminded them of the position of wealth and dignity which had been theirs and their father s before them and shewed them the poverty to which their extravagance had reduced them and adjured them most earnestly that before their destitution was yet further manifest they should all three sell what little remained to them and depart thence which accordingly they did

 Alessandro obeyed laying a hand upon the abbot s bosom where he encountered two little teats round firm and delicate as they had been of ivory whereby he at once knew that twas a woman and without awaiting further encouragement forthwith embraced her and would have kissed her when she said Before thou art more familiar with me hearken to what I have to say to thee

 Andreuccio nothing doubting did so but by ill luck set his foot on a plank which was detached from the joist at the further end whereby down it went and he with it

 She hied forthwith to her chamber and after a hasty search found Andreuccio s clothes and the money in them for he foolishly thought to secure himself against risk by carrying it always on his person and thus being possessed of the prize for which she had played her ruse passing herself off as the sister of a man of Perugia whereas she was really of Palermo she concerned herself no further with Andreuccio except to close with all speed the door by which he had gone out when he fell

 Andreuccio by this time needed no further evidence of his wrongs his wrath knew no bounds and mortification well nigh converted it into frenzy he was minded to exact by force what he had failed to obtain by entreaties and so arming himself with a large stone he renewed his attack upon the door with fury dealing much heavier blows than at first

 Then without further parley for it was now midnight they hied them to the cathedral

 Wherefore he commanded that the pair should be confined in separate prisons and closely guarded and kept short of food and in sore discomfort until further order which was accordingly done and the life which the captives led their endless tears their fasts of inordinate duration may be readily imagined

 Currado marvelled to hear him thus speak and being assured of his magnanimity and the fervour of his love held him the more dear wherefore he rose embraced and kissed him and without further delay bade privily bring thither Spina who left her prison wasted and wan and weak and so changed that she seemed almost another woman than of yore even as Giannotto was scarce his former self

 A hidden spring of memory was thus touched she recognised in the man the lineaments of her boy and awaiting no further evidence she ran with open arms and threw herself upon his neck

 This done he concerted further action with some of his most trusty friends who readily lent him their aid to carry his design into execution

 Finding it vacant they supposed that the Prince was gone off privily somewhere to have a few days of unbroken delight with his fair lady and so they gave themselves no further trouble

 So the citizens were instant with one accord that the Prince s brother whom they chose as his successor should exact the debt of vengeance and he having satisfied himself by further investigation that their suspicion was well founded summoned to his aid his kinsfolk friends and divers vassals and speedily gathered a large powerful and well equipped army with intent to make war upon the Duke of Athens

 These words were followed by such a flood of tears that albeit she had intended yet further to press her suit speech failed her her eyes drooped and almost swooning with emotion she let her head fall upon the Count s breast

 And that thou mayst not think that we who have spoken with much freedom about our wives deem them to be of another nature and mould than thine but mayst know that we have but uttered what common sense dictates I am minded to go a little further into this matter with thee

 Verily rejoined Ambrogiuolo this should suffice but as thou requirest that I say somewhat further I will satisfy thee

 So Bernabo being come and further delay inexpedient she seized her opportunity and persuaded the Soldan to cite Ambrogiuolo and Bernabo before him that in Bernabo s presence Ambrogiuolo might be examined of his boast touching Bernabo s wife and the truth hereof if not to be had from him by gentle means be elicited by torture

 And if now I live in mortar sin I will ever abide there until it be pestle sin concern yourself no further on my account

 Then said the King And I am minded to take your advice wherefore without giving you further trouble I will leave you

 The gallant having rather more insight than the holy friar was not slow to penetrate the lady s finesse he therefore made as if he were rather shame stricken promised to go no further with the matter and hied him straight from the friar to the lady s house where she was always posted at a little casement to see if he were passing by

 Lo now answered the lady once again I will not vex or disobey you but be sure that you so order matters that he refrain from further annoyance as I give you my word that never will I have recourse to you again touching this matter

 Well indeed hast thou laid my admonitions to heart to say nothing of the many proofs which she has given thee of her disdain But I have yet a word for thee hitherto not that she bears thee any love but that she has yielded to my urgent prayers she has kept silence as to thy misdeeds she will do so no more I have given her leave to act as she may think fit if thou givest her any further annoyance

 The lady understood very well what the monk meant by enjoining him not to stir from his post until matins and deeming it an excellent device she said that she was well content that he should do this or aught else that he thought good for his soul and to the end that his penance might be blest of she would herself fast with him though she would go no further

 The further consequence will be mortal enmity between your husband and me and the event were as like to be that I killed him as that he killed me which if I did you would never more know joy or peace

 Inasmuch as for some reason or another the lady having shewn herself gracious towards Tedaldo for a while completely altered her mien and not only shewed him no further favour but would not so much as receive a message from him or suffer him to see her face whereby he fell a prey to a grievous and distressful melancholy but so well had he concealed his love that the cause of his melancholy was surmised by none

 I now go further and say that so far as in you lay you slew him seeing that shewing yourself ever more and more cruel you did your utmost to drive him to take his own life and in the law s intent he that is the cause that wrong is done is as culpable as he that does it

 Satisfied with this answer the pilgrim without further parley heartily exhorted Aldobrandino to be of good cheer assuring him that before the next day was done he should be certified beyond all manner of doubt of his deliverance and so he left him

 Wherefore before I address myself to make further confession I in all humility beseech you to be pleased to give me some counsel of this matter for here or nowhere is to be found the source of the amelioration of my life and if it be not found neither confession nor any other good work will be of any avail

 The lady to render purposeless further visits or messages on Bertrand s part withdrew with her daughter to the house of her kinsfolk in the country nor was it long before Bertrand on the urgent entreaty of his vassals and intelligence of the departure of his wife quitted Florence and returned home

 Where seeing the palaces the houses the churches and all matters else with which the city abounds and of which he had no more recollection than if he had never seen them the boy found all passing strange and questioned his father of not a few of them what they were and how they were named his curiosity being no sooner satisfied in one particular than he plied his father with a further question

 Ninette believed him and being fain to go for very fear she forewent further leave taking of her sister more particularly as it was now night and set out with Foulques who took with him such little money as he could lay his hands upon and so they made their way to the coast where they got aboard a bark but none ever knew where their voyage ended

 Whereupon without further delay the battle began on both sides with a furious discharge of arrows and stones on which wise it was long protracted to their common loss until at last Gerbino seeing that he gained little advantage took a light bark which they had brought from Sardinia and having fired her bore down with her and both the galleys upon the ship

 On the morrow he told his brothers that which touching Lisabetta and Lorenzo he had observed in the night which that no shame might thence ensue either to them or to their sister they after long consultation determined to pass over in silence making as if they had seen or heard nought thereof until such time as they in a safe and convenient manner might banish this disgrace from their sight before it could go further

 Whereat he started up in consternation and struck a light and with out further parley with his wife clapped the dead man s clothes upon him and forthwith confident in his own innocence raised him on his shoulders and bore him to the door of his house where he set him down and left him

 Now a few days before two young men that were usurers had taken up their quarters in a house a little further on they had seen the chest during the day and being short of furniture and having a mind to make great gain with little expenditure they had resolved that if it were still there at night they would take it home with them

 Seeing that twas easy enough to find out whether the story were true the Stadic began by questioning the leech as to the water and found that twas as she had said he then summoned the carpenter the owner of the chest and the usurers and after much further parley ascertained that the usurers had stolen the chest during the night and brought it into their house finally he sent for Ruggieri and asked him where he had lodged that night to which Ruggieri answered that where he had lodged he knew not but he well remembered going to pass the night with Master Mazzeo s maid in whose room he had drunk some water by reason of a great thirst that he had but what happened to him afterwards except that when he awoke he found himself in a chest in the house of the usurers he knew not

 The Englishmen in Africa went even further saying that these poor blacks were held in virtual slavery since after their terms of enlistment expired their ignorance was imposed upon by their white officers and they were told that they had yet several years to serve

 Words passed between Clayton and the captain the former making it plain that he was disgusted with the brutality displayed toward the crew nor would he countenance anything further of the kind while he and Lady Greystoke remained passengers

 Ere he had scarce finished his little speech he had turned and was limping off toward the forecastle with the very apparent intention of forestalling any further conversation

 As Clayton stooped to reach for it he was amazed to see it move further into the room and then he realized that it was being pushed inward by someone from without

 The last entry in his diary was made the morning following her death and there he recites the sad details in a matter of fact way that adds to the pathos of it for it breathes a tired apathy born of long sorrow and hopelessness which even this cruel blow could scarcely awake to further suffering My little son is crying for nourishment O Alice Alice what shall I do And as John Clayton wrote the last words his hand was destined ever to pen he dropped his head wearily upon his outstretched arms where they rested upon the table he had built for her who lay still and cold in the bed beside him

 She made the leap successfully but as she grasped the limb of the further tree the sudden jar loosened the hold of the tiny babe where it clung frantically to her neck and she saw the little thing hurled turning and twisting to the ground thirty feet below

 She had seen one child fall from her back to a terrible death and she would take no further chances with this

 The deep waters of the lake he had been taught by his wild mother to avoid and further had he not seen little Neeta sink beneath its quiet surface only a few short weeks before never to return to the tribe But of the two evils his quick mind chose the lesser ere the first note of Sabor s scream had scarce broken the quiet of the jungle and before the great beast had covered half her leap Tarzan felt the chill waters close above his head

 There were many apes with faces similar to his own and further over in the book he found under M some little monkeys such as he saw daily flitting through the trees of his primeval forest

 Near the middle of the book he found his old enemy Sabor the lioness and further on coiled Histah the snake

 When he discovered the arrangement of words in alphabetical order he delighted in searching for and finding the combinations with which he was familiar and the words which followed them their definitions led him still further into the mazes of erudition

 How snug he would have been beneath the heavy coat of Sabor And so was added a further incentive to the adventure

 Their yellow teeth were filed to sharp points and their great protruding lips added still further to the low and bestial brutishness of their appearance

 Around many a dusky neck hung curiously coiled strands of wire while several were further ornamented by huge nose rings

 The tribe continued to find the hunting good in the vicinity of the beach and so Tarzan of the Apes varied his archery practice with further investigation of his father s choice though little store of books

 Inside all was darkness but his groping hands soon found the object for which he sought and without further delay he turned again toward the door

 So Tarzan scolds them both and threatens Gunto with a taste of the death bearing slivers if he abuses Tana further and Tana for her part is compelled to promise better attention to her wifely duties

 Ah yes indeed yes indeed most remarkable most remarkable said the professor but I can add nothing further to what I have already remarked in elucidation of this truly momentous occurrence and the professor turned slowly in the direction of the jungle

 The act of the little rat faced sailor in killing one of his comrades had aroused a strong dislike in Tarzan and now that he saw him quarreling with the fine looking young man his animosity was still further stirred

 A further glance revealed a second skeleton upon the bed

 To Tarzan s surprise the young man was heading further into the jungle in the general direction of Mbonga s village and the shrewd young ape man was convinced that he was lost

 It was quite some moments ere either moved for both were positive that any such attempt would reveal so many breaks and fractures as to make further progress impossible

 Further argument was interrupted by Tarzan who seeing that these strange men were not following him had returned to their side

 There was no further comment on the killing but the men worked in a better frame of mind than they had since Snipes had assumed command

 Three miles were covered before Tarzan overtook them and then Terkoz seeing that further flight was futile dropped to the ground in a small open glade that he might turn and fight for his prize or be free to escape unhampered if he saw that the pursuer was more than a match for him

 As she watched him from beneath half closed lids Tarzan crossed the little circular clearing toward the trees upon the further side

 This fact caused Jane to indulge in further speculation and it taxed her imagination to picture how this beautiful ornament came into the possession of a wild and savage creature of the unexplored jungles of Africa

 For a few moments he sat in silence his eyes bent upon the ground while Jane held the little locket in her hand turning it over and over in an endeavor to find some further clue that might lead to the identity of its original owner

 They halted for a brief rest then and after pushing on for a short distance further one of the men discovered a well marked trail

 The blacks who had seized D Arnot had not waited to participate in the fight which followed but instead had dragged their prisoner a little way through the jungle and then struck the trail further on beyond the scene of the fighting in which their fellows were engaged

 Had he been too late to be of service to the lieutenant he would have been back before now the fact that he is not back is sufficient proof to me that he is delayed because Lieutenant D Arnot is wounded or he has had to follow his captors further than the village which your sailors attacked

 Jane would have begged for a further reprieve had it not been that she too had begun to believe that her forest lover would return no more

 I should hate to trust its findings further than to differentiate between individuals

 He did not press the matter further but if ever a man had murder in his heart it was William Cecil Clayton Lord Greystoke when a week later Robert Canler drew up before the farmhouse in his purring six cylinder

 Will you go away and never molest her further Again the man nodded his head his face distorted by fear of the death that had been so close

 Before we go further sir I should like an explanation of the events which have just transpired

 And further added Tarzan you need not fear that your pride will suffer Professor Porter for you will be able to pay the Canler person what you owe him the moment you reach home

 This announcement broke up further conversation and the entire party went out to the waiting automobiles

 This idea of men s equality the Dukhoborts have directed further against the State authority

 And so on with further castigation of the author for what he never wrote and which he himself Priestley was the unconscious means of introducing into the text within the year of Paine s publication

 The learned divine writes But the subject before us admits of further illustration from the example of Mr

 As it is necessary to affix right ideas to words I will before I proceed further into the subject offer some observations on the word revelation

 I now proceed further with that subject for the purpose of applying it to the books in question

 Having now arrived at this point if we carry our ideas only one thought further we shall see perhaps the true reason at least a very good reason for our happiness why the Creator instead of making one immense world extending over an immense quantity of space has preferred dividing that quantity of matter into several distinct and separate worlds which we call planets of which our earth is one

 But before going further into this subject it will be proper to inquire what is to be understood by a miracle

 But as nothing in this description conveys the idea that is affixed to the word miracle it is necessary to carry the inquiry further

 As to the ancient historians from Herodotus to Tacitus we credit them as far as they relate things probable and credible and no further for if we do we must believe the two miracles which Tacitus relates were performed by Vespasian that of curing a lame man and a blind man in just the same manner as the same things are told of Jesus Christ by his historians

 These miracles are quite as well authenticated as the Bible miracles and yet we do not believe them consequently the degree of evidence necessary to establish our belief of things naturally incredible whether in the Bible or elsewhere is far greater than that which obtains our belief to natural and probable things and therefore the advocates for the Bible have no claim to our belief of the Bible because that we believe things stated in other ancient writings since that we believe the things stated in those writings no further than they are probable and credible or because they are self evident like Euclid or admire them because they are elegant like Homer or approve them because they are sedate like Plato or judicious like Aristotle

 My intention is to shew that those books are spurious and that Moses is not the author of them and still further that they were not written in the time of Moses nor till several hundred years afterwards that they are no other than an attempted history of the life of Moses and of the times in which he is said to have lived and also of the times prior thereto written by some very ignorant and stupid pretenders to authorship several hundred years after the death of Moses as men now write histories of things that happened or are supposed to have happened several hundred or several thousand years ago

 This proves as I have before said that this story of Saul Samuel and the asses was an ancient story at the time the book of Samuel was written and consequently that Samuel did not write it and that the book is without authenticity But if we go further into those books the evidence is still more positive that Samuel is not the writer of them for they relate things that did not happen till several years after the death of Samuel

 the name of Jonah is mentioned on account of the restoration of a tract of land by Jeroboam but nothing further is said of him nor is any allusion made to the book of Jonah nor to his expedition to Nineveh nor to his encounter with the whale

 Is it not reasonable to suppose that by the cherubims he meant the temple at Jerusalem where they had figures of cherubims and by a wheel within a wheel which as a figure has always been understood to signify political contrivance the project or means of recovering Jerusalem In the latter part of his book he supposes himself transported to Jerusalem and into the temple and he refers back to the vision on the river Chebar and says xliii that this last vision was like the vision on the river Chebar which indicates that those pretended dreams and visions had for their object the recovery of Jerusalem and nothing further

 We have further understood that there are many chaplains in the said territories of Tynedale and Redesdale who are public and open maintainers of concubinage irregular suspended excommunicated and interdicted persons and withal so utterly ignorant of letters that it has been found by those who objected this to them that there were some who having celebrated mass for ten years were still unable to read the sacramental service

 When he awakes the strangers appear before him and after listening to a long and eloquent harangue on the superior attractions of a residence among the birds they propose a notable scheme of their own to further enhance its advantages and definitely secure the sovereignty of the universe now exercised by the gods of Olympus

 HERACLES Your further condition seems fair to me

 Hence it must be assumed not only that half civilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species and further that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown

 But when we compare the dray horse and race horse the dromedary and camel the various breeds of sheep fitted either for cultivated land or mountain pasture with the wool of one breed good for one purpose and that of another breed for another purpose when we compare the many breeds of dogs each good for man in very different ways when we compare the game cock so pertinacious in battle with other breeds so little quarrelsome with everlasting layers which never desire to sit and with the bantam so small and elegant when we compare the host of agricultural culinary orchard and flower garden races of plants most useful to man at different seasons and for different purposes or so beautiful in his eyes we must I think look further than to mere variability

 We can I think further understand the frequently abnormal character of our domestic races and likewise their differences being so great in external characters and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs

 I think these views further explain what has sometimes been noticed namely that we know nothing about the origin or history of any of our domestic breeds

 When further improved by the same slow and gradual process they will spread more widely and will get recognised as something distinct and valuable and will then probably first receive a provincial name

 But my tables further show that in any limited country the species which are most common that is abound most in individuals and the species which are most widely diffused within their own country and this is a different consideration from wide range and to a certain extent from commonness often give rise to varieties sufficiently well marked to have been recorded in botanical works

 Look at the most vigorous species by as much as it swarms in numbers by so much will its tendency to increase be still further increased

 For as all the inhabitants of each country are struggling together with nicely balanced forces extremely slight modifications in the structure or habits of one inhabitant would often give it an advantage over others and still further modifications of the same kind would often still further increase the advantage

 When by renewed elevation the islands shall be re converted into a continental area there will again be severe competition the most favoured or improved varieties will be enabled to spread there will be much extinction of the less improved forms and the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants of the renewed continent will again be changed and again there will be a fair field for natural selection to improve still further the inhabitants and thus produce new species

 I further believe that this very slow intermittent action of natural selection accords perfectly well with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of this world have changed

 But we may go further than this for as new forms are continually and slowly being produced unless we believe that the number of specific forms goes on perpetually and almost indefinitely increasing numbers inevitably must become extinct

 But we may go further than this

 One large group will slowly conquer another large group reduce its numbers and thus lessen its chance of further variation and improvement

 Forbes speaks confidently that shells at their southern limit and when living in shallow water are more brightly coloured than those of the same species further north or from greater depths

 As with mariners shipwrecked near a coast it would have been better for the good swimmers if they had been able to swim still further whereas it would have been better for the bad swimmers if they had not been able to swim at all and had stuck to the wreck

 De Candolle has remarked that winged seeds are never found in fruits which do not open I should explain the rule by the fact that seeds could not gradually become winged through natural selection except in fruits which opened so that the individual plants producing seeds which were a little better fitted to be wafted further might get an advantage over those producing seed less fitted for dispersal and this process could not possibly go on in fruit which did not open

 The same author and some botanists have further remarked that multiple parts are also very liable to variation in structure

 There may be truly said to be a constant struggle going on between on the one hand the tendency to reversion to a less modified state as well as an innate tendency to further variability of all kinds and on the other hand the power of steady selection to keep the breed true

 It further deserves notice that these variable characters produced by man s selection sometimes become attached from causes quite unknown to us more to one sex than to the other generally to the male sex as with the wattle of carriers and the enlarged crop of pouters

 All being mainly due to the species of the same group having descended from a common progenitor from whom they have inherited much in common to parts which have recently and largely varied being more likely still to go on varying than parts which have long been inherited and have not varied to natural selection having more or less completely according to the lapse of time overmastered the tendency to reversion and to further variability to sexual selection being less rigid than ordinary selection and to variations in the same parts having been accumulated by natural and sexual selection and thus adapted for secondary sexual and for ordinary specific purposes

 It might further be expected that the species of the same genus would occasionally exhibit reversions to lost ancestral characters

 Without here entering on further details I may state that I have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes in horses of very different breeds in various countries from Britain to Eastern China and from Norway in the north to the Malay Archipelago in the south

 Any part or organ developed to an extraordinary size or in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part or organ in the allied species must have gone through an extraordinary amount of modification since the genus arose and thus we can understand why it should often still be variable in a much higher degree than other parts for variation is a long continued and slow process and natural selection will in such cases not as yet have had time to overcome the tendency to further variability and to reversion to a less modified state

 But a far more important consideration as I believe is that during the process of further modification by which two varieties are supposed on my theory to be converted and perfected into two distinct species the two which exist in larger numbers from inhabiting larger areas will have a great advantage over the intermediate variety which exists in smaller numbers in a narrow and intermediate zone

 For forms existing in larger numbers will always have a better chance within any given period of presenting further favourable variations for natural selection to seize on than will the rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers

 From this cause alone the intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental extermination and during the process of further modification through natural selection they will almost certainly be beaten and supplanted by the forms which they connect for these from existing in greater numbers will in the aggregate present more variation and thus be further improved through natural selection and gain further advantages

 Nor can I see any insuperable difficulty in further believing it possible that the membrane connected fingers and fore arm of the Galeopithecus might be greatly lengthened by natural selection and this as far as the organs of flight are concerned would convert it into a bat

 Yet reason tells me that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple each grade being useful to its possessor can be shown to exist if further the eye does vary ever so slightly and the variations be inherited which is certainly the case and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection though insuperable by our imagination can hardly be considered real

 He who will go thus far if he find on finishing this treatise that large bodies of facts otherwise inexplicable can be explained by the theory of descent ought not to hesitate to go further and to admit that a structure even as perfect as the eye of an eagle might be formed by natural selection although in this case he does not know any of the transitional grades

 Further we must suppose that there is a power always intently watching each slight accidental alteration in the transparent layers and carefully selecting each alteration which under varied circumstances may in any way or in any degree tend to produce a distincter image

 A trailing bamboo in the Malay Archipelago climbs the loftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around the ends of the branches and this contrivance no doubt is of the highest service to the plant but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees which are not climbers the hooks on the bamboo may have arisen from unknown laws of growth and have been subsequently taken advantage of by the plant undergoing further modification and becoming a climber

 So we may believe that the progenitor of the seal had not a flipper but a foot with five toes fitted for walking or grasping and we may further venture to believe that the several bones in the limbs of the monkey horse and bat which have been inherited from a common progenitor were formerly of more special use to that progenitor or its progenitors than they now are to these animals having such widely diversified habits

 When two varieties are formed in two districts of a continuous area an intermediate variety will often be formed fitted for an intermediate zone but from reasons assigned the intermediate variety will usually exist in lesser numbers than the two forms which it connects consequently the two latter during the course of further modification from existing in greater numbers will have a great advantage over the less numerous intermediate variety and will thus generally succeed in supplanting and exterminating it

 But we may confidently believe that many modifications wholly due to the laws of growth and at first in no way advantageous to a species have been subsequently taken advantage of by the still further modified descendants of this species

 We must suppose the Melipona to arrange her cells in level layers as she already does her cylindrical cells and we must further suppose and this is the greatest difficulty that she can somehow judge accurately at what distance to stand from her fellow labourers when several are making their spheres but she is already so far enabled to judge of distance that she always describes her spheres so as to intersect largely and then she unites the points of intersection by perfectly flat surfaces

 We have further to suppose but this is no difficulty that after hexagonal prisms have been formed by the intersection of adjoining spheres in the same layer she can prolong the hexagon to any length requisite to hold the stock of honey in the same way as the rude humble bee adds cylinders of wax to the circular mouths of her old cocoons

 But let us suppose that this latter circumstance determined as it probably often does determine the numbers of a humble bee which could exist in a country and let us further suppose that the community lived throughout the winter and consequently required a store of honey there can in this case be no doubt that it would be an advantage to our humble bee if a slight modification of her instinct led her to make her waxen cells near together so as to intersect a little for a wall in common even to two adjoining cells would save some little wax

 For why should the sterility be so extremely different in degree when various species are crossed all of which we must suppose it would be equally important to keep from blending together Why should the degree of sterility be innately variable in the individuals of the same species Why should some species cross with facility and yet produce very sterile hybrids and other species cross with extreme difficulty and yet produce fairly fertile hybrids Why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species Why it may even be asked has the production of hybrids been permitted to grant to species the special power of producing hybrids and then to stop their further propagation by different degrees of sterility not strictly related to the facility of the first union between their parents seems to be a strange arrangement

 Gartner further admits that hybrids between very closely allied species are more variable than those from very distinct species and this shows that the difference in the degree of variability graduates away

 Gartner further insists that when any two species although most closely allied to each other are crossed with a third species the hybrids are widely different from each other whereas if two very distinct varieties of one species are crossed with another species the hybrids do not differ much

 I endeavoured also to show that intermediate varieties from existing in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect will generally be beaten out and exterminated during the course of further modification and improvement

 Very many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range thousands of miles beyond its confines and analogy leads me to believe that it would be chiefly these far ranging species which would oftenest produce new varieties and the varieties would at first generally be local or confined to one place but if possessed of any decided advantage or when further modified and improved they would slowly spread and supplant their parent forms

 Lately Professor Pictet has carried their existence one sub stage further back and some palaeontologists believe that certain much older fishes of which the affinities are as yet imperfectly known are really teleostean

 But I have reason to believe that one great authority Sir Charles Lyell from further reflexion entertains grave doubts on this subject

 It is also natural that the dominant varying and far spreading species which already have invaded to a certain extent the territories of other species should be those which would have the best chance of spreading still further and of giving rise in new countries to new varieties and species

 On the other hand proceeding still further westward from the eastern islands of the tropical parts of the Pacific we encounter no impassable barriers and we have innumerable islands as halting places until after travelling over a hemisphere we come to the shores of Africa and over this vast space we meet with no well defined and distinct marine faunas

 In their new homes they will be exposed to new conditions and will frequently undergo further modification and improvement and thus they will become still further victorious and will produce groups of modified descendants

 If the climate since the Glacial period has ever been in any degree warmer than at present as some geologists in the United States believe to have been the case chiefly from the distribution of the fossil Gnathodon then the arctic and temperate productions will at a very late period have marched a little further north and subsequently have retreated to their present homes but I have met with no satisfactory evidence with respect to this intercalated slightly warmer period since the Glacial period

 During the Glacial period when the inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived further southwards than at present they must have been still more completely separated by wider spaces of ocean

 Hence we may suppose that the organisms now living under the climate of latitude deg during the Pliocene period lived further north under the Polar Circle in latitude deg deg and that the strictly arctic productions then lived on the broken land still nearer to the pole

 We can further understand the singular fact remarked on by several observers that the productions of Europe and America during the later tertiary stages were more closely related to each other than they are at the present time for during these warmer periods the northern parts of the Old and New Worlds will have been almost continuously united by land serving as a bridge since rendered impassable by cold for the inter migration of their inhabitants

 Further south on both sides of the continent from lat

 As the warmth returned these temperate forms would naturally ascend the higher mountains being exterminated on the lowlands those which had not reached the equator would re migrate northward or southward towards their former homes but the forms chiefly northern which had crossed the equator would travel still further from their homes into the more temperate latitudes of the opposite hemisphere

 I further attempted to show that from the varying descendants of each species trying to occupy as many and as different places as possible in the economy of nature there is a constant tendency in their characters to diverge

 These five genera have also much though less in common and they form a family distinct from that including the three genera still further to the right hand which diverged at a still earlier period

 Instances could be given amongst plants and insects of a group of forms first ranked by practised naturalists as only a genus and then raised to the rank of a sub family or family and this has been done not because further research has detected important structural differences at first overlooked but because numerous allied species with slightly different grades of difference have been subsequently discovered

 But further than this variations which for all that we can see might have appeared earlier or later in life tend to appear at a corresponding age in the offspring and parent

 Some further explanation however of the embryo not undergoing any metamorphosis is perhaps requisite

 But I doubt whether any of these cases throw light on the origin of rudimentary organs in a state of nature further than by showing that rudiments can be produced for I doubt whether species under nature ever undergo abrupt changes

 The theory of natural selection even if we looked no further than this seems to me to be in itself probable

 Analogy would lead me one step further namely to the belief that all animals and plants have descended from some one prototype

 This new woman gave him further to understand that though it was absolutely the same to her whom he married yet she had decided to prevent this marriage for no particular reason but that she chose to do so and because she wished to amuse herself at his expense for that it was quite her turn to laugh a little now Such were her words very likely she did not give her real reason for this eccentric conduct but at all events that was all the explanation she deigned to offer

 Gania asked for further details and the prince once more repeated the conversation

 The prince followed quietly making no further objection for fear of irritating the old man

 Many of them expected to be thrown downstairs at once without further ceremony the elegant arid irresistible Zaleshoff among them

 It appeared that neither the prince nor the doctor with whom he lived in Switzerland had thought of waiting for further communications but the prince had started straight away with Salaskin s letter in his pocket

 Epanchin determined to proceed without further delay

 The prince glanced at it but took no further notice

 Lef Nicolaievitch said Rogojin after a pause during which the two walked along a little further I have long wished to ask you do you believe in God How strangely you speak and how odd you look said the other involuntarily

 This reasoning however seemed to end in a paradox and lead to the further consideration What matter though it be only disease an abnormal tension of the brain if when I recall and analyze the moment it seems to have been one of harmony and beauty in the highest degree an instant of deepest sensation overflowing with unbounded joy and rapture ecstatic devotion and completest life Vague though this sounds it was perfectly comprehensible to Muishkin though he knew that it was but a feeble expression of his sensations

 Well I warn you that one fine morning I shall deprive myself of the pleasure of his further acquaintance

 General Epanchin only knew that there was a recitation of verses going on and took no further interest in the matter

 Educated men learned men even are to be found among Nihilists these go further in that they are men of action

 I would go further and say that you are altogether right and that I quite agree with you if there were not something lacking in your speech

 I was only seeking further information to put the finishing touch

 Moreover anew trouble almost a fear showed itself in his eyes he watched Hippolyte anxiously as if expecting something further

 It was not as she said But I ask you my dear sir how can there be anything in common between Evgenie Pavlovitch and her and again Rogojin I tell you he is a man of immense wealth as I know for a fact and he has further expectations from his uncle

 At any rate I have changed my opinion about you and I think right to inform you of the fact but I also suppose that there can be no further inter course between us ANTIP BURDOVSKY

 The subject under discussion did not appear to be very popular with the assembly and some would have been delighted to change it but Evgenie would not stop holding forth and the prince s arrival seemed to spur him on to still further oratorical efforts

 Just at these steps the group paused as though it feared to proceed further but very quickly one of the three ladies who formed its apex stepped forward into the charmed circle followed by two members of her suite

 Some of the spectators had risen from their places and departed altogether some merely exchanged their seats for others a little further off some were delighted with the occurrence and talked and laughed over it for a long time

 At all events they were clearly enjoying themselves and the prince observed further on closer investigation that all had been drinking champagne

 Sixty monks and not a single layman It is a terrible idea but it is historic it is statistic it is indeed one of those facts which enables an intelligent historian to reconstruct the physiognomy of a special epoch for it brings out this further point with mathematical accuracy that the clergy were in those days sixty times richer and more flourishing than the rest of humanity

 Do you know what has suddenly come into my head said I suddenly leaning further and further over the rail

 On the contrary though I had not actually told him my thought in the morning yet I know he understood it and this thought was of such a character that it would not be anything very remarkable if one were to come for further talk about it at any hour of night however late

 We awoke him for further inquiries and had the greatest difficulty in making him understand what was up

 That is not so curious in itself but here the evidence opens out further

 By doing this they have been able to persuade themselves without further trouble that they have acquired new convictions of their own

 Examining the depths of her conscience she found nothing to reproach herself with and this still further strengthened her in her designs

 He would abruptly commence to hold forth about the Epanchins about Lebedeff or the prince and equally abruptly would stop short and refuse to speak another word answering all further questions with a stupid smile unconscious that he was smiling or that he had been asked a question

 When the prince did give the matter a little attention he recalled the fact that during these days he had always found Lebedeff to be in radiantly good spirits when they happened to meet and further that the general and Lebedeff were always together

 But he goes further he actually pitches into me because as he declares any decent fellow would die quietly and that all this is mere egotism on my part

 He declared further that he had intended to go every day but had always been prevented by circumstances but that now he would promise himself the pleasure however far it was he would find them out

 Atheism only preaches a negation but Romanism goes further it preaches a disfigured distorted Christ it preaches Anti Christ I assure you I swear it This is my own personal conviction and it has long distressed me

 Wasn t it you he said suddenly turning to the old gentleman who saved the student Porkunoff and a clerk called Shoabrin from being sent to Siberia two or three months since The old dignitary blushed a little and murmured that the prince had better not excite himself further

 He had heard a good deal of this story here and there and was greatly interested in it so much so that he longed to ask further questions about it

 She was only waiting for the hour that would bring the matter to a final climax and every hint every careless probing of her wound did but further lacerate her heart

 It was said that Elizabetha Prokofievna and her daughters had there and then denounced the prince in the strongest terms and had refused any further acquaintance and friendship with him their rage and denunciations being redoubled when Varia Ardalionovna suddenly arrived and stated that Aglaya had been at her house in a terrible state of mind for the last hour and that she refused to come home

 Lebedeff then in tragic tones told of the approaching marriage whereupon the other nodded his head and replied that after all marriages like that were not so rare that he had heard that the lady was very fascinating and of extraordinary beauty which was enough to explain the infatuation of a wealthy man that further thanks to the liberality of Totski and of Rogojin she possessed so he had heard not only money but pearls diamonds shawls and furniture and consequently she could not be considered a bad match

 He guessed at once that they knew perfectly well who he was and that yesterday ought to have been his wedding day and further that they were dying to ask about the wedding and especially about why he should be here now inquiring for the woman who in all reasonable human probability might have been expected to be with him in Pavlofsk

 The evidence of the porter went further than anything else towards the success of Lebedeff in gaining the assistance of the police

 The prince s further fate was more or less decided by Colia who selected out of all the persons he had met during the last six or seven months Evgenie Pavlovitch as friend and confidant

 She was so fascinated that even before marrying him she joined a committee that had been organized abroad to work for the restoration of Poland and further she visited the confessional of a celebrated Jesuit priest who made an absolute fanatic of her

 It is a matter of honour with me that I can give no further particulars about the letter nor put it into your hands but I assure you that there is nothing else in it which can affect the interests of the lodge

 Proceeding further aft one enters the control room in which one periscope is situated and the necessary valves and pumps for diving the boat

 For an instant I felt speechless an impulse came to me to ring off without further ado but I restrained myself and then a fine idea came into my head

 It occurred to me that the air was escaping through the vents with a strangely loud noise but before I could consider the matter further or even inquire the reason for this sudden dive the noise increased to a terrifying extent and whilst I prepared myself for the worst it culminated into a roar as of fifty express trains going through a tunnel mingled with the noise of a high powered aeroplane engine

 I relentlessly ordered the field current to be still further reduced

 It was Zoe I was quite incapable of any remark and my confusion was further increased when after a few Hello s which I idiotically repeated her clear level tones said Is that you Karl How are you How was I What a question to ask I wanted to tell her that I was bubbling with joy that a thousand kilogramme load had been lifted from my chest that my blood was coursing through my veins that I usually so cool was trembling with excitement that I could have kissed the mouthpiece of the humble instrument that linked us together

 The Commodore was sealing an envelope as I came in he looked up and saw me then without taking any further notice of me he resumed his business with the envelope

 I am a sailor and to every sailor every ship that floats has as it were a soul a personality an entity to carry the analogy further a merchant craft is like some fat beast of utility an ox a cow or a sheep whilst a warship is a lion if she is a battleship a leopard if she is a light cruiser etc

 Further procedure on the surface was suicidal and we kept hydrophone patrol twice hearing the motors of the enemy submarine

 As I hesitated for a second as to my course of action I was astounded to see a large submarine which must have been British on an opposite course not more than metres away This sounds absurd but it really wasn t further

 The impasse with Zoe still continues and my peace of mind has been still further disturbed by the actual arrival of Rosa

 My first impulse was to send her a wire but on thinking matters over I decided that it would be difficult to put all my thoughts into the curt sentences of a telegram and further that as all wires are doubtless examined at the Main Post Office at Bruges it might lead to trouble so I wrote her a letter

 I have dropped a line to Fritz Regels who is on old Max s staff and told him that I do not wish to return to Bruges and I further hinted that I understood a detached squadron was proceeding somewhere and as far as I was concerned the further the better if I could get into it

 A letter from Fritz saying that he has an idea that Korting s boat would suit me though he could not of course give me further details in a letter however he informs me positively that I shall not be at Bruges

 My doubts were removed for me since I received special orders at noon by high power wireless from Nordreich and on decoding them found that for some reason or other we are ordered to proceed to Muckle Flugga Cape and thence down the coast of Shetlands to the Fair Island Channel where we are directed to cruise till further orders

 We must have been a hundred and fifty metres from the first charge and a little below it five others followed in rapid succession but were further away and we suffered no damage beyond a couple of broken lights

 There is no further mention of the latter stages of Karl s passage in the wrecked boat to Zeebrugge so it is presumed that he made that port without further adventure

 It may be that one day the German archives of the period of occupation will reveal further details

 I tried to telegraph to the Kaiser for you Zoe but the wire never got further than Bruges post office they stopped it and put me under arrest

 He asserted that this gland is so suspended in the midst of the brain that it could be moved by the slightest motion of the animal spirits further that this gland is suspended in the midst of the brain in as many different manners as the animal spirits can impinge thereon and again that as many different marks are impressed on the said gland as there are different external objects which impel the animal spirits towards it whence it follows that if the will of the soul suspends the gland in a position wherein it has already been suspended once before by the animal spirits driven in one way or another the gland in its turn reacts on the said spirits driving and determining them to the condition wherein they were when repulsed before by a similar position of the gland

 He further asserted that every act of mental volition is united in nature to a certain given motion of the gland

 Further I should much like to know what degree of motion the mind can impart to this pineal gland and with what force can it hold it suspended For I am in ignorance whether this gland can be agitated more slowly or more quickly by the mind than by the animal spirits and whether the motions of the passions which we have closely united with firm decisions cannot be again disjoined therefrom by physical causes in which case it would follow that although the mind firmly intended to face a given danger and had united to this decision the motions of boldness yet at the sight of the danger the gland might become suspended in a way which would preclude the mind thinking of anything except running away

 Perhaps a hundred years of acute hostility to England had something to do with this family trait but in his case it went further and became indifference to social distinction

 As night came on the Latin School was steadily forced back to the Beacon Street Mall where they could retreat no further without disbanding and by that time only a small band was left headed by two heroes Savage and Marvin

 Within Boston a boy was first an eighteenth century politician and afterwards only a possibility beyond Boston the first step led only further into politics

 Education could go no further in that course and ran off into emotion but as the boy gradually found his surroundings change and felt himself no longer an isolated atom in a hostile universe but a sort of herring fry in a shoal of moving fish he began to learn the first and easier lessons of practical politics

 On that line too education could go no further

 By some further affinity these three outsiders fell into relation with the Bostonians among whom Adams as a schoolboy belonged and in the end with Adams himself although they and he knew well how thin an edge of friendship separated them in from mortal enmity

 Further on these lines one could not go

 He cared little or nothing about the point in discussion he was even willing to admit that Sumner might be right though in all great emergencies he commonly found that every one was more or less wrong he liked lofty moral principle and cared little for political tactics he felt a profound respect for Sumner himself but the shock opened a chasm in life that never closed and as long as life lasted he found himself invariably taking for granted as a political instinct with out waiting further experiment as he took for granted that arsenic poisoned the rule that a friend in power is a friend lost

 For many months he looked on himself as lost or finished in the character of private secretary and as about to begin without further experiment a final education in the ranks of the Army of the Potomac where he would find most of his friends enjoying a much pleasanter life than his own

 Every day the British Government deliberately crowded him one step further into the grave

 The small fry of the Legations were admitted there or tolerated without a further effort to recognize their existence but they were pleased because rarely tolerated anywhere else and there they could at least stand in a corner and look at a bishop or even a duke

 That Palmerston had wanted a quarrel was obvious why then did he submit so tamely to being made the victim of the quarrel The correspondence that followed his note was conducted feebly on his side and he allowed the United States Minister to close it by a refusal to receive further communications from him except through Lord Russell

 I agree further that in case of failure we ought ourselves to recognize the Southern States as an independent State

 Granville replied at once decidedly opposing recognition of the Confederacy and Russell sent the reply to Palmerston who returned it October with the mere suggestion of waiting for further news from America

 On the morning of October he entered in his diary Reflected further on what I should say about Lancashire and America for both these subjects are critical

 Considerations such as these prevented the matter being pursued any further

 I did not perceive the gross impropriety of such an utterance from a Cabinet Minister of a power allied in blood and language and bound to loyal neutrality the case being further exaggerated by the fact that we were already so to speak under indictment before the world for not as was alleged having strictly enforced the laws of neutrality in the matter of the cruisers

 Not from a sense of personal griefs or disappointments did he labor over this part of the social problem but only because his education was becoming English and the further it went the less it promised

 The planet itself seemed less impressive in its old fashioned deliberate annual or daily revolution than this huge wheel revolving within arm s length at some vertiginous speed and barely murmuring scarcely humming an audible warning to stand a hair s breadth further for respect of power while it would not wake the baby lying close against its frame

 Satisfied that the sequence of men led to nothing and that the sequence of their society could lead no further while the mere sequence of time was artificial and the sequence of thought was chaos he turned at last to the sequence of force and thus it happened that after ten years pursuit he found himself lying in the Gallery of Machines at the Great Exposition of his historical neck broken by the sudden irruption of forces totally new

 This unprecedented triumph in his negotiations with the Senate enabled him to carry one step further his measures for general peace

 Philosophers as a rule cared little what principles society affirmed or denied since the philosopher commonly held that though he might sometimes be right by good luck on some one point no complex of individual opinions could possibly be anything but wrong yet supposing society to be ignored the philosopher was no further forward

 The new psychology went further and seemed convinced that it had actually split personality not only into dualism but also into complex groups like telephonic centres and systems that might be isolated and called up at will and whose physical action might be occult in the sense of strangeness to any known form of force

 Few centres of great energy lived in illusion more complete or archaic than Washington with its simple minded standards of the field and farm its Southern and Western habits of life and manners its assumptions of ethics and history but even in Washington society was uneasy enough to need no further fretting

 The volume contained only one paragraph that concerned a historian it was that in which Haeckel sank his voice almost to a religious whisper in avowing with evident effort that the proper essence of substance appeared to him more and more marvellous and enigmatic as he penetrated further into the knowledge of its attributes matter and energy and as he learned to know their innumerable phenomena and their evolution

 Since Haeckel seemed to have begun the voyage into multiplicity that Pearson had forbidden to Englishmen he should have been a safe pilot to the point at least of a proper essence of substance in its attributes of matter and energy but Ernst Mach seemed to go yet one step further for he rejected matter altogether and admitted but two processes in nature change of place and interconversion of forms

 Further it defines force as anything that does or helps to do work

 The economic needs of a violently centralizing society forced the empire to enlarge its slave system until the slave system consumed itself and the empire too leaving society no resource but further enlargement of its religious system in order to compensate for the losses and horrors of the failure

 Monsieur le vicomte I will push my interrogatory no further and reproach myself with having carried it so far

 When arrived at the apartment destined for the king which communicated not only with the little passage we have passed through but further with the great staircase leading to the court Will your majesty said Gaston condescend to occupy this apartment all unworthy as it is to receive you Uncle replied the young king I render you my thanks for your cordial hospitality

 That which would still further have appeared if not inconvenient at least extraordinary to a stranger was that the side of the castle destined for monsieur le cardinal was brilliant light and cheerful

 And the officer without further notice of the unknown resumed his interrupted conversation

 Still further

 In refusing me two hundred gentlemen you are still further in the right for you are prime minister and you have in the eyes of France the responsibility of peace and war

 Now I am going alone and beg of you not to accompany me or have me accompanied any further

 Go a little further off said the august patient to the executioner it is but for an instant and I know that I belong to you but remember not to strike till I give the signal

 said D Artagnan but remove these people a little further off first

 It might have been thought that these intrepid warriors who had made such a noise in the streets of London had set out with the hopes of meeting no one and that now seeing that they had met an army and that that army hoisted before them not only a standard but still further a cause and a principle it might have been believed we say that these intrepid warriors had begun to reflect that they were less good republicans than the soldiers of Monk since the latter supported the parliament whilst Lambert supported nothing not even himself

 Athos knew Monk to be too well informed of all concerning Charles to venture to urge the discussion further it was neither the time nor the place

 This was a commission easily performed for the sergeant uneasy at the general s being in that desolate abbey had drawn nearer by degrees and was not much further off than the fisherman

 My dear D Artagnan said he pressing his hand affectionately should you not exercise a little more philosophy Is it not some further satisfaction to you to have saved my life as you did by arriving so fortunately with Monk when those damned parliamentarians wanted to burn me alive Well but you in some degree deserved a little burning my friend

 And oh what still further joy it would be if our two friends were there at the two corners of the tables and Raoul my beloved Raoul on the threshold looking at us with his large eyes at once so brilliant and so soft Yes yes said D Artagnan much affected that is true

 Sire I beg you to allow me to settle this matter myself and if your majesty has no further need of my services No chevalier

 She made a courtesy to her friend a more profound one to Fouquet and took leave under pretense of having a number of visits to make without the marquise trying to prevent her or Fouquet a prey to anxiety thinking further about her

 Fouquet and Pellisson took no further account of this circumstance beyond deploring the minute s delay they had thus to submit to

 Now then let us see Knowing all that and holding my tongue what further would this heart wish in return for a kind action of M

 To have embarked for Belle Isle at Roche Bernard would have been to expose himself still further to comments which had perhaps been already made and would be carried to the castle

 And further on Sanger and then the palace

 Ah Porthos cried D Artagnan letting his arms fall as a conquered man gives up his sword ah my friend you are not only a herculean topographer you are still further a dialectician of the first water

 But how the devil did you learn all that asked D Artagnan who began to fear that the investigation of Aramis had extended further than he wished

 Monsieur said he at the expiration of a minute not only is Belle Isle known to me but still further Belle Isle is mine

 The conversation terminated there although De Guiche tried his utmost to draw out his secret from him but doubtless De Wardes had determined to say nothing further and he remained impenetrable

 When however he held it in his hand Guiche observed that he still awaited something further

 The admiral however without taking any further notice of the duke s ill humor led the princesses into the quarter deck cabin where dinner had been served with a magnificence worthy in every respect of his guests

 CHAPTER The Tents The admiral as we have seen was determined to pay no further attention to Buckingham s threatening glances and fits of passion

 At the entrance to the tents the soldiers barred his passage and his further progress was arrested

 CHAPTER An Account of what the Chevalier de Lorraine thought of Madame Nothing further interrupted the journey

 What can that matter to him If I am to die of it I shall die of it and then I shall need nothing further

 A greater reason for getting further

 de Wardes I hope all is finished between us and that you will have no further occasion to speak ill of me again

 de Wardes and you must listen to me still further

 The sentinel at the outer guardhouse stopped Aramis s further progress asking him in a rough tone of voice what had brought him there

 With his own hands too he placed upon the table with much solicitude the bag containing the gold which one of the soldiers had brought up with the most respectful devotion and the soldier having left the room Baisemeaux himself closed the door after him drew aside one of the window curtains and looked steadfastly at Aramis to see if the prelate required anything further

 Tell me then madame why have you been so harsh these three or four months past Harsh Yes did you not forbid me to visit you Alas said Madame de Belliere sighing because your visit to me was the cause of your being visited with a great misfortune because my house is watched because the same eyes that have seen you already might see you again because I think it less dangerous for you that I should come here than that you should come to my house and lastly because I know you to be already unhappy enough not to wish to increase your unhappiness further

 A further illustration may be found in the version published in by Peter Motteux who had then recently combined tea dealing with literature

 You shall see shortly he says the further exploits of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza

 Even if Cervantes had finished the volume he had in hand most assuredly he would have left off with a promise of a Third Part giving the further adventures of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza as shepherds

 A further counsel bear in mind If that thy roof be made of glass It shows small wit to pick up stones To pelt the people as they pass

 But these freaks of his guest were not much to the liking of the landlord so he determined to cut matters short and confer upon him at once the unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventure could occur so going up to him he apologised for the rudeness which without his knowledge had been offered to him by these low people who however had been well punished for their audacity

 He asked her name and she said it was La Molinera and that she was the daughter of a respectable miller of Antequera and of her likewise Don Quixote requested that she would adopt the Don and call herself Dona Molinera making offers to her further services and favours

 So then provided it seems good to you Master Nicholas I say let this and Amadis of Gaul be remitted the penalty of fire and as for all the rest let them perish without further question or query

 The two were unwilling to make any further answer as they saw that his anger was kindling

 Then on the faith of that promise said Don Quixote I shall do him no further harm though he well deserves it of me

 Sancho gave him many thanks and again kissing his hand and the skirt of his hauberk helped him to mount Rocinante and mounting his ass himself proceeded to follow his master who at a brisk pace without taking leave or saying anything further to the ladies belonging to the coach turned into a wood that was hard by

 Hearing this Sancho said to him Your worship should bear in mind Senor Don Quixote that if the knight has done what was commanded him in going to present himself before my lady Dulcinea del Toboso he will have done all that he was bound to do and does not deserve further punishment unless he commits some new offence

 Seeing his good intention the travellers were unwilling to press him further and once more bidding him farewell they left him and pursued their journey in the course of which they did not fail to discuss the story of Marcela and Chrysostom as well as the madness of Don Quixote

 Sancho insisted that it was an inn and his master that it was not one but a castle and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settled they had time to reach it and into it Sancho entered with all his team without any further controversy

 The shepherds came up and felt sure they had killed him so in all haste they collected their flock together took up the dead beasts of which there were more than seven and made off without waiting to ascertain anything further

 He took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was borne some sorely wounded or slain knight to avenge whom was a task reserved for him alone and without any further reasoning he laid his lance in rest fixed himself firmly in his saddle and with gallant spirit and bearing took up his position in the middle of the road where the encamisados must of necessity pass and as soon as he saw them near at hand he raised his voice and said Halt knights or whosoever ye may be and render me account of who ye are whence ye come where ye go what it is ye carry upon that bier for to judge by appearances either ye have done some wrong or some wrong has been done to you and it is fitting and necessary that I should know either that I may chastise you for the evil ye have done or else that I may avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted upon you

 Once more he tried his luck and succeeded so well that without any further noise or disturbance he found himself relieved of the burden that had given him so much discomfort

 By this time day had fully broken and everything showed distinctly and Don Quixote saw that he was among some tall trees chestnuts which cast a very deep shade he perceived likewise that the sound of the strokes did not cease but could not discover what caused it and so without any further delay he let Rocinante feel the spur and once more taking leave of Sancho he told him to wait for him there three days at most as he had said before and if he should not have returned by that time he might feel sure it had been God s will that he should end his days in that perilous adventure

 Sancho seeing that he was getting an awkward return in earnest for his jest and fearing his master might carry it still further said to him very humbly Calm yourself sir for by God I am only joking

 Sancho did so with great alacrity and though the valise was secured by a chain and padlock from its torn and rotten condition he was able to see its contents which were four shirts of fine holland and other articles of linen no less curious than clean and in a handkerchief he found a good lot of gold crowns and as soon as he saw them he exclaimed Blessed be all Heaven for sending us an adventure that is good for something Searching further he found a little memorandum book richly bound this Don Quixote asked of him telling him to take the money and keep it for himself

 And so saying he gave Rocinante the spur and Sancho followed him on foot and loaded and after having partly made the circuit of the mountain they found lying in a ravine dead and half devoured by dogs and pecked by jackdaws a mule saddled and bridled all which still further strengthened their suspicion that he who had fled was the owner of the mule and the saddle pad

 As she appeared to him in her dressing gown she drove all the beauties he had seen until then out of his recollection speech failed him his head turned he was spell bound and in the end love smitten as you will see in the course of the story of my misfortune and to inflame still further his passion which he hid from me and revealed to Heaven alone it so happened that one day he found a note of hers entreating me to demand her of her father in marriage so delicate so modest and so tender that on reading it he told me that in Luscinda alone were combined all the charms of beauty and understanding that were distributed among all the other women in the world

 While the curate was speaking the disguised damsel stood as if spell bound looking at them without opening her lips or uttering a word just like a village rustic to whom something strange that he has never seen before has been suddenly shown but on the curate addressing some further words to the same effect to her sighing deeply she broke silence and said Since the solitude of these mountains has been unable to conceal me and the escape of my dishevelled tresses will not allow my tongue to deal in falsehoods it would be idle for me now to make any further pretence of what if you were to believe me you would believe more out of courtesy than for any other reason

 All this she who was now seen to be a lovely woman delivered without any hesitation with so much ease and in so sweet a voice that they were not less charmed by her intelligence than by her beauty and as they again repeated their offers and entreaties to her to fulfil her promise she without further pressing first modestly covering her feet and gathering up her hair seated herself on a stone with the three placed around her and after an effort to restrain some tears that came to her eyes in a clear and steady voice began her story thus In this Andalusia there is a town from which a duke takes a title which makes him one of those that are called Grandees of Spain

 The moment the speaker mentioned the name of Don Fernando Cardenio changed colour and broke into a sweat with such signs of emotion that the curate and the barber who observed it feared that one of the mad fits which they heard attacked him sometimes was coming upon him but Cardenio showed no further agitation and remained quiet regarding the peasant girl with fixed attention for he began to suspect who she was

 But all this was suddenly brought to an end for the time came when all such considerations were disregarded and there was no further question of honour when my patience gave way and the secret of my heart became known abroad

 I will not answer a word beauteous lady replied Don Quixote nor will I listen to anything further concerning you until you rise from the earth

 No senor replied Sancho for as soon as I had repeated it seeing there was no further use for it I set about forgetting it and if I recollect any of it it is that about Scrubbing I mean to say Sovereign Lady and the end Yours till death the Knight of the Rueful Countenance and between these two I put into it more than three hundred my souls and my life s and my eyes

 But for all she tugged at it the barber would not give it up until the licentiate told him to let her have it as there was now no further occasion for that stratagem because he might declare himself and appear in his own character and tell Don Quixote that he had fled to this inn when those thieves the galley slaves robbed him and should he ask for the princess s squire they could tell him that she had sent him on before her to give notice to the people of her kingdom that she was coming and bringing with her the deliverer of them all

 To all this and much more that Anselmo said to Lothario to persuade him to come to his house as he had been in the habit of doing Lothario replied with so much prudence sense and judgment that Anselmo was satisfied of his friend s good intentions and it was agreed that on two days in the week and on holidays Lothario should come to dine with him but though this arrangement was made between them Lothario resolved to observe it no further than he considered to be in accordance with the honour of his friend whose good name was more to him than his own

 And this thou art bound to do for one reason alone that being as I am resolved to apply this test it is not for thee to permit me to reveal my weakness to another and so imperil that honour thou art striving to keep me from losing and if thine may not stand as high as it ought in the estimation of Camilla while thou art paying court to her that is of little or no importance because ere long on finding in her that constancy which we expect thou canst tell her the plain truth as regards our stratagem and so regain thy place in her esteem and as thou art venturing so little and by the venture canst afford me so much satisfaction refuse not to undertake it even if further difficulties present themselves to thee for as I have said if thou wilt only make a beginning I will acknowledge the issue decided

 Lothario seeing the fixed determination of Anselmo and not knowing what further examples to offer or arguments to urge in order to dissuade him from it and perceiving that he threatened to confide his pernicious scheme to some one else to avoid a greater evil resolved to gratify him and do what he asked intending to manage the business so as to satisfy Anselmo without corrupting the mind of Camilla so in reply he told him not to communicate his purpose to any other for he would undertake the task himself and would begin it as soon as he pleased

 The next day he received the four thousand crowns and with them four thousand perplexities for he knew not what to say by way of a new falsehood but in the end he made up his mind to tell him that Camilla stood as firm against gifts and promises as against words and that there was no use in taking any further trouble for the time was all spent to no purpose

 Be content Anselmo and refrain from making further proof and as thou hast passed dryshod through the sea of those doubts and suspicions that are and may be entertained of women seek not to plunge again into the deep ocean of new embarrassments or with another pilot make trial of the goodness and strength of the bark that Heaven has granted thee for thy passage across the sea of this world but reckon thyself now safe in port moor thyself with the anchor of sound reflection and rest in peace until thou art called upon to pay that debt which no nobility on earth can escape paying

 It did not occur to Lothario that this man he had seen issuing at such an untimely hour from Anselmo s house could have entered it on Leonela s account nor did he even remember there was such a person as Leonela all he thought was that as Camilla had been light and yielding with him so she had been with another for this further penalty the erring woman s sin brings with it that her honour is distrusted even by him to whose overtures and persuasions she has yielded and he believes her to have surrendered more easily to others and gives implicit credence to every suspicion that comes into his mind

 The instant the captive mentioned the name of Don Pedro de Aguilar Don Fernando looked at his companions and they all three smiled and when he came to speak of the sonnets one of them said Before your worship proceeds any further I entreat you to tell me what became of that Don Pedro de Aguilar you have spoken of

 We all approved of what he said and so without further delay guided by him we made for the vessel and he leaping on board first drew his cutlass and said in Morisco Let no one stir from this if he does not want it to cost him his life

 Acting on this warning no one answered a word but after we had gone a little ahead and the vessel was now lying to leeward suddenly they fired two guns and apparently both loaded with chain shot for with one they cut our mast in half and brought down both it and the sail into the sea and the other discharged at the same moment sent a ball into our vessel amidships staving her in completely but without doing any further damage

 CHAPTER XLII WHICH TREATS OF WHAT FURTHER TOOK PLACE IN THE INN AND OF SEVERAL OTHER THINGS WORTH KNOWING With these words the captive held his peace and Don Fernando said to him In truth captain the manner in which you have related this remarkable adventure has been such as befitted the novelty and strangeness of the matter

 The servant had further informed him that he was now going to the Indies with the appointment of Judge of the Supreme Court of Mexico and he had learned likewise that the young lady was his daughter whose mother had died in giving birth to her and that he was very rich in consequence of the dowry left to him with the daughter

 Forgive me noble lady and retire to your apartment and do not by any further declaration of your passion compel me to show myself more ungrateful and if of the love you bear me you should find that there is anything else in my power wherein I can gratify you provided it be not love itself demand it of me for I swear to you by that sweet absent enemy of mine to grant it this instant though it be that you require of me a lock of Medusa s hair which was all snakes or even the very beams of the sun shut up in a vial

 Don Quixote smiled when he heard these words and said very calmly Come now base ill born brood call ye it highway robbery to give freedom to those in bondage to release the captives to succour the miserable to raise up the fallen to relieve the needy Infamous beings who by your vile grovelling intellects deserve that heaven should not make known to you the virtue that lies in knight errantry or show you the sin and ignorance in which ye lie when ye refuse to respect the shadow not to say the presence of any knight errant Come now band not of officers but of thieves footpads with the licence of the Holy Brotherhood tell me who was the ignoramus who signed a warrant of arrest against such a knight as I am Who was he that did not know that knights errant are independent of all jurisdictions that their law is their sword their charter their prowess and their edicts their will Who I say again was the fool that knows not that there are no letters patent of nobility that confer such privileges or exemptions as a knight errant acquires the day he is dubbed a knight and devotes himself to the arduous calling of chivalry What knight errant ever paid poll tax duty queen s pin money king s dues toll or ferry What tailor ever took payment of him for making his clothes What castellan that received him in his castle ever made him pay his shot What king did not seat him at his table What damsel was not enamoured of him and did not yield herself up wholly to his will and pleasure And lastly what knight errant has there been is there or will there ever be in the world not bold enough to give single handed four hundred cudgellings to four hundred officers of the Holy Brotherhood if they come in his way CHAPTER XLVI OF THE END OF THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE HOLY BROTHERHOOD AND OF THE GREAT FEROCITY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE While Don Quixote was talking in this strain the curate was endeavouring to persuade the officers that he was out of his senses as they might perceive by his deeds and his words and that they need not press the matter any further for even if they arrested him and carried him off they would have to release him by and by as a madman to which the holder of the warrant replied that he had nothing to do with inquiring into Don Quixote s madness but only to execute his superior s orders and that once taken they might let him go three hundred times if they liked

 In the end they as officers of justice settled the question by arbitration in such a manner that both sides were if not perfectly contented at least to some extent satisfied for they changed the pack saddles but not the girths or head stalls and as to Mambrino s helmet the curate under the rose and without Don Quixote s knowing it paid eight reals for the basin and the barber executed a full receipt and engagement to make no further demand then or thenceforth for evermore amen

 The Ingratitude Revenged was not nonsense nor was there any in The Numantia nor any to be found in The Merchant Lover nor yet in The Friendly Fair Foe nor in some others that have been written by certain gifted poets to their own fame and renown and to the profit of those that brought them out some further remarks I added to these with which I think I left him rather dumbfoundered but not so satisfied or convinced that I could disabuse him of his error

 But I will not expatiate any further upon this as it may be gathered from it that whatever part of whatever history of a knight errant one reads it will fill the reader whoever he be with delight and wonder and take my advice sir and as I said before read these books and you will see how they will banish any melancholy you may feel and raise your spirits should they be depressed

 She said moreover that the soldier without robbing her of her honour had taken from her everything she had and made off leaving her in the cave a thing that still further surprised everybody

 Thou needst say no more to him nor will I say anything more to thee save to tell thee to bear in mind that this Second Part of Don Quixote which I offer thee is cut by the same craftsman and from the same cloth as the First and that in it I present thee Don Quixote continued and at length dead and buried so that no one may dare to bring forward any further evidence against him for that already produced is sufficient and suffice it too that some reputable person should have given an account of all these shrewd lunacies of his without going into the matter again for abundance even of good things prevents them from being valued and scarcity even in the case of what is bad confers a certain value

 Then Don Quixote being vanquished the bachelor knight was to command him to return to his village and his house and not quit it for two years or until he received further orders from him all which it was clear Don Quixote would unhesitatingly obey rather than contravene or fail to observe the laws of chivalry and during the period of his seclusion he might perhaps forget his folly or there might be an opportunity of discovering some ready remedy for his madness

 From this last observation of Don Quixote s the traveller began to have a suspicion that he was some crazy being and was waiting him to confirm it by something further but before they could turn to any new subject Don Quixote begged him to tell him who he was since he himself had rendered account of his station and life

 To these he added some further words that banished all hope of his giving up his insane project

 The keeper seeing that the fugitives were now some distance off once more entreated and warned him as before but he replied that he heard him and that he need not trouble himself with any further warnings or entreaties as they would be fruitless and bade him make haste

 To this the student bachelor or as Don Quixote called him licentiate replied I have nothing whatever to say further but that from the moment Basilio learned that the fair Quiteria was to be married to Camacho the rich he has never been seen to smile or heard to utter rational word and he always goes about moody and dejected talking to himself in a way that shows plainly he is out of his senses

 If the packet is express from the devil said Sancho it must be a very dirty packet no doubt but what good can it do Master Pedro to have such packets Thou dost not understand me Sancho said Don Quixote I only mean he must have made some compact with the devil to infuse this power into the ape that he may get his living and after he has grown rich he will give him his soul which is what the enemy of mankind wants this I am led to believe by observing that the ape only answers about things past or present and the devil s knowledge extends no further for the future he knows only by guesswork and that not always for it is reserved for God alone to know the times and the seasons and for him there is neither past nor future all is present

 The cause of that soreness said Don Quixote will be no doubt that the staff wherewith they smote thee being a very long one it caught thee all down the back where all the parts that are sore are situated and had it reached any further thou wouldst be sorer still

 Turn the rein or the halter of thy Dapple and begone home for one single step further thou shalt not make in my company

 When he had done laughing he said to Don Quixote You have replied on your own behalf so stoutly Sir Knight of the Lions that there is no occasion to seek further satisfaction for this which though it may look like an offence is not so at all for as women can give no offence no more can ecclesiastics as you very well know

 In addition to all this commotion there came a further disturbance to increase the tumult for now it seemed as if in truth on all four sides of the wood four encounters or battles were going on at the same time in one quarter resounded the dull noise of a terrible cannonade in another numberless muskets were being discharged the shouts of the combatants sounded almost close at hand and farther away the Moorish lelilies were raised again and again

 They would have carried on this duenna dispute further had they not heard the notes of the fife and drums once more from which they concluded that the Distressed Duenna was making her entrance

 Don Quixote thought that to say anything further with regard to his safety would be putting his courage in an unfavourable light and so without more words he mounted Clavileno and tried the peg which turned easily and as he had no stirrups and his legs hung down he looked like nothing so much as a figure in some Roman triumph painted or embroidered on a Flemish tapestry

 If your highness wishes to gratify me still further though I deserve it not permit me to please myself and wait upon myself in my own room for I place a barrier between my inclinations and my virtue and I do not wish to break this rule through the generosity your highness is disposed to display towards me and in short I will sleep in my clothes sooner than allow anyone to undress me

 He said that no doubt his debtor had told the truth for he believed him to be an honest man and a good Christian and he himself must have forgotten when and how he had given him back the crowns and that from that time forth he would make no further demand upon him

 Don Quixote I am replied Don Quixote he whose profession it is to aid and succour the living and the dead in their necessities wherefore tell me who thou art for thou art keeping me in suspense because if thou art my squire Sancho Panza and art dead since the devils have not carried thee off and thou art by God s mercy in purgatory our holy mother the Roman Catholic Church has intercessory means sufficient to release thee from the pains thou art in and I for my part will plead with her to that end so far as my substance will go without further delay therefore declare thyself and tell me who thou art

 Well then said the lacquey I feel qualms of conscience and I should lay a heavy burden upon it if I were to proceed any further with the combat I therefore declare that I yield myself vanquished and that I am willing to marry the lady at once

 In a word he pledged himself to be mine and I promised to be his without carrying matters any further

 I question thee no further said the fair querist

 No no senor replied Sancho it shall never be said of me The money paid the arms broken go back a little further your worship and let me give myself at any rate a thousand lashes more for in a couple of bouts like this we shall have finished off the lot and there will be even cloth to spare

 He was about to pass it when he perceived a ladder against the eaves and the reflection that the higher he got the further he could see led Jude to stand and regard it

 Then the day came when it suddenly occurred to him that if he ascended to the point of view after dark or possibly went a mile or two further he would see the night lights of the city

 The tree of knowledge grows there he added a few steps further on

 After a further consideration of a few days he did act and on the day of the piano s departure which happened to be his next birthday clandestinely placed the letter inside the packing case directed to his much admired friend being afraid to reveal the operation to his aunt Drusilla lest she should discover his motive and compel him to abandon his scheme

 Somebody might have come along that way who would have asked him his trouble and might have cheered him by saying that his notions were further advanced than those of his grammarian

 In fact his disappointment at the nature of those tongues had after a while been the means of still further glorifying the erudition of Christminster

 On the further side of the stream stood a small homestead having a garden and pig sties attached in front of it beside the brook three young women were kneeling with buckets and platters beside them containing heaps of pigs chitterlings which they were washing in the running water

 She saw that he had singled her out from the three as a woman is singled out in such cases for no reasoned purpose of further acquaintance but in commonplace obedience to conjunctive orders from headquarters unconsciously received by unfortunate men when the last intention of their lives is to be occupied with the feminine

 They started off down the hill almost at a trot but on gaining level ground at the bottom and walking a mile they found that the spot of the fire was much further off than it had seemed

 On my word I don t No further that is than by plain courting and taking care he don t go too far The third girl looked at the second

 Where did Father and Mother part by the Brown House did you say A little further on where the road to Fenworth branches off and the handpost stands

 She further went on to say that her parents had as he knew for some time considered the question of emigrating to Australia the pig jobbing business being a poor one nowadays

 A little further on was the summit whence Christminster or what he had taken for that city had seemed to be visible

 His grand aunt had gruffly replied that she was his cousin Sue Bridehead of the inimical branch of the family and on further questioning the old woman had replied that the girl lived in Christminster though she did not know where or what she was doing

 Close to this college was another and a little further on another and then he began to be encircled as it were with the breath and sentiment of the venerable city

 The Christminster sentiment as it had been called ate further and further into him till he probably knew more about those buildings materially artistically and historically than any one of their inmates

 So would she be to him a kindly star an elevating power a companion in Anglican worship a tender friend III BUT under the various deterrent influences Jude s instinct was to approach her timidly and the next Sunday he went to the morning service in the Cathedral church of Cardinal College to gain a further view of her for he had found that she frequently attended there

 Before either had reached it she called out to him I am not going to meet you just there for the first time in my life Come further on

 But Sue s class was at the further end of the room and her back was towards the entrance the inspector therefore came and stood behind her and watched her teaching some half minute before she became aware of his presence

 Was he not Arabella s He was unable to go on further and retraced his steps towards Christminster

 Phillotson was giving up the school near Christminster for a larger one further south in Mid Wessex

 He only heard in part the policeman s further remarks having fallen into thought on what struggling people like himself had stood at that crossway whom nobody ever thought of now

 As it would be necessary that he should continue for a time to work at his trade while reading up Divinity which he had neglected at Christminster for the ordinary classical grind what better course for him than to get employment at the further city and pursue this plan of reading That his excessive human interest in the new place was entirely of Sue s making while at the same time Sue was to be regarded even less than formerly as proper to create it had an ethical contradictoriness to which he was not blind

 Jude felt much depressed she seemed to get further and further away from him with her strange ways and curious unconsciousness of gender

 How was that made I altered my old one by cutting up all the Epistles and Gospels into separate BROCHURES and rearranging them in chronological order as written beginning the book with Thessalonians following on with the Epistles and putting the Gospels much further on

 But he received no further communication and in the intensity of his solicitude he sent another note suggesting that he should pay her a visit some Sunday the distance being under eighteen miles

 They looked away from each other to hide their emotion took each other s hand without further speech and went on together awhile till she glanced at him with furtive solicitude

 You are dear free Sue Bridehead only you don t know it Wifedom has not yet squashed up and digested you in its vast maw as an atom which has no further individuality

 They told him it was a red brick building some little way further on

 As strange wild birds are seen assembled on some lofty promontory meditatively pausing for longer flights or to return by the course they followed thither so here in this cliff town stood in stultified silence the yellow and green caravans bearing names not local as if surprised by a change in the landscape so violent as to hinder their further progress and here they usually remained all the winter till they turned to seek again their old tracks in the following spring

 With the elusiveness of her curious double nature however Sue did not stand still for any further greeting though it wanted some time to the burial

 It was not for him to consider further he had only to confront the obvious which was that he had made himself quite an impostor as a law abiding religious teacher

 But I won t intrude on you further only I would advise you not to shut the door too tight or I shall find you stifled to morrow

 No further incident touching the matter between them occurred till the following evening when immediately school was over Phillotson walked out of Shaston saying he required no tea and not informing Sue where he was going

 But it is a delight in being with you of a supremely delicate kind and I don t want to go further and risk it by an attempt to intensify it I quite realized that as woman with man it was a risk to come

 Don t discuss it further dear Jude Of course if it would make you reproach yourself 

 I can t explain any further

 Gillingham saw that his rather headstrong friend would not be able to maintain such a position as this but he said nothing further and in due time indeed in a quarter of an hour the formal letter of dismissal arrived the managers having remained behind to write it after Phillotson s withdrawal

 Both cases had been too insignificant to be reported in the papers further than by name in a long list of other undefended cases

 Saying nothing further the boy came out into the street looking round to see that nobody followed or observed him

 The great western highway from London passes through it near a point where the road branches into two merely to unite again some twenty miles further westward

 Nothing further was said in Jude s presence but he knew what this meant and turning to the table wrote a note resigning his office there and then

 Eight or nine years ago when I came here first I had a neat stock of fixed opinions but they dropped away one by one and the further I get the less sure I am

 Much good may it do you I cannot explain further here

 And now you add to your cruelty by leaving me Ah yes The further I flounder the more harm I do O Sue said he with a sudden sense of his own danger

 They are not mine but I shall make use of them to further mine

 He himself went further into the church

 As soon as she got up into the street Arabella hastened on forbidding the physician to accompany her further that day

 This tendency towards contraction spreads and induces further withdrawal of deposits thus requiring the banks to reduce their loans and so runs on and on to increasing discomfort and uneasiness until panic is speedily produced

 The recognition of these truths brought about the further reduction of duties until in which year the tariff was once more raised

 It had the contrary effect it is believed for it still further of course unsettled rates for goods when prices were already unstable

 The further regulating of business

 Prices being high and discounts and loans large in proportion to deposits and having steadily increased for years danger is near further when discounts and loans are not only large in proportion to deposits having increased steadily for years and then suddenly fallen off noticeably for a considerable time only to increase again danger is imminent

 The general approbation brought about a still further increase in their number the bank notes of the Bank of Philadelphia were at a discount of per cent

 This agreement was not given out freely which still further increased the feeling of distrust

 This melancholy state of things was still further aggravated on the th of May by the failure of Donnel Lawson Simpson and Hatch Foote

 To still further increase the joint responsibility of the members of the clearing house it was agreed that a committee should be charged with receiving as collateral bills and securities in exchange for which certificates of deposit bearing per cent

 Confidence is restored and prices have advanced and should advance still further

 Carlisle forbade the further issuance of gold certificates for gold deposited in the Treasury under Act of July whenever the gold in the Treasury reserved for the redemption of United States notes falls below 

 This further alarmed the business world which was not reassured when on the th Carlisle announced that the Treasury would pay gold for all Treasury notes so long as he had gold lawfully available for that purpose

 BANK RESOURCES TO PREVENT STRAIN The further use of the existing financial agencies for cooperation of the banks in all sections to mass resources and apply them to prevent undue local strain upon credit dispels the fear of any necessary injury to the financial fabric in effecting this change

 His plans further failed by not reasonably insuring for the transition period from the old tariff to the new one sufficient national income for national expenses

 The radical doctrines of many political leaders tended to further unrest

 The coming revision of the tariff was of itself sufficient further to restrict business undertakings and to cause many great producers of goods to arrange to unload at lowering prices their actual and their future outputs

 The securities market that barometer of business fell beneath such assurance of further unsettlement

 Governor Harmon of Ohio was mentioned in many quarters as a successful reformer who wished soundly to guide but not unwittingly injure business while Underwood was similarly praised in addition to his record on the recasting of the tariff into a further revenue measure

 This statement is freely taken for granted three centuries afterwards by Urne in the first edition of the book but is not traced further back than an epitomator who wrote more than years after Saxo s death

 Of these men we know nothing further unless the Saxo whom he names as one of Waldemar s admirals be his grandfather in which case his family was one of some distinction and his father and grandfather probably King s men 

 Further editions were reprinted during the sixteenth century at Basic and at Frankfort on Main but they did not improve in any way upon the first and the next epoch in the study of Saxo was made by the edition and notes of Stephanus Johansen Stephanius published at Copenhagen in the middle of the seventeenth century 

 He must in such case be mastered and prevented doing further harm by decapitation and thigh forking or by staking and burning

 Further those who pursued a wanton life and yielded to the stress of incontinence above measure thou hast redeemed from nerveless sloth to a more upright state of mind partly by continuing instant in wholesome reproof and partly by the noble example of simple living leaving it in doubt whether thou hast edified them more by word or deed

 Further he regained by his virtue the realm that his father s wickedness had lost

 And he forced them by his power not only to lay down their divinity but further to quit the country deeming that they who tried to foist themselves so iniquitously into the skies ought to be outcasts from the earth

 Going further they came on a swift and tumbling river of leaden waters whirling down on its rapid current divers sorts of missiles and likewise made passable by a bridge

 Then a wall hard to approach and to climb blocked their further advance

 Further I would rather have my husband than my father king would rather be ranked a king s wife than daughter

 Also loth to say nothing about the estate of his brother he further spoke the following poem Think us men not monsters we are slaves who drove our lingering flocks for pasture through the country

 Further if we cast away this gold the greater the enemy thinks our fear the hotter will be his chase

 Further they should know that the plunder had been abandoned by the enemy of set purpose and that the gold had been scattered rather to betray them than to profit them

 He was very skilled in swimming and archery and also with the gloves and further was as nimble as such a youth could be his training being equal to his strength

 They averted indeed that they could win triumphs and inflict defeats as they would and further told him how Balder had seen his foster sister Nanna while she bathed and been kindled with passion for her but counselled Hother not to attack him in war worthy as he was of his deadliest hate for they declared that Balder was a demigod sprung secretly from celestial seed

 Gewar being very learned in divining and an expert in the knowledge of omens foresaw this and summoning Hother told him when Gelder should join battle with him to receive his spears with patience and not let his own fly until he saw the enemy s missiles exhausted and further to bring up the curved scythes wherewith the vessels could be rent and the helmets and shields plucked from the soldiers

 Also to omit no circumstance of greatness they further gave his the name of Odin trying by the prestige of that title to be rid of the obloquy of innovation

 For supposing that he had laid low the bravest of the Danes he did not think that any of them would have any heart left to fight further with him upon his challenge

 So Rorik was vexed that the general courage should be sapped by the impudence of one man and that the Danes with their roll of victories should be met presumptuously by those whom they had beaten of old nay should be ignominiously spurned further that in all that host not one man should be found so quick of spirit or so vigorous of arm that he longed to sacrifice his life for his country

 He further said that the king had the eyes of a slave and that the queen had in three ways shown the behaviour of a bondmaid

 Further he mentioned that the king s mother had been brought into slavery from captivity lest she should seem servile only in her habits yet not in her birth

 The queen who was named Hermutrude took and read it and spoke most warmly of Amleth s diligence and shrewdness saying that Feng had deserved his punishment and that the unfathomable wit of Amleth had accomplished a deed past all human estimation seeing that not only had his impenetrable depth devised a mode of revenging his father s death and his mother s adultery but it had further by his notable deeds Of prowess seized the kingdom of the man whom he had found constantly plotting against him

 So the envoys flagging and despairing of their wish left the further conduct of the affair to the wisdom of Gotwar who tried to subdue the maiden not only with words but with love philtres and began to declare that Frode used his left hand as well as his right and was a quick and skillful swimmer and fighter

 They further received orders to kill Erik if they found him with Gunwar

 d Further that the first man to flee in battle should forfeit all common rights

 q Further he appointed that if an alien killed a Dane his death should be redressed by the slaying of two foreigners

 Moreover he ordained that whosoever durst try and make further use of the horse after he had crossed the river should be condemned to death

 So few guests were bidden moreover that it seemed unsafe for them to accept the invitation and it was further thought foolish to trust their lives to the good faith of an enemy whom they did not know

 He further thought that for the same reason all men s property should be secured to them by a protective decree so that what had been saved from a foreign enemy might not find a plunderer at home

 He further deliberately drew blood from the beast on which he had ridden and bespattered it so that when it came back into camp he might make them think he himself was dead

 And when Fridleif sent a further embassy to ask for her wishing to vanquish the refusal by persistency Amund was indignant that a petition he had once denied should be obstinately pressed and hurried the envoys to death wishing to offer a brutal check to the zeal of this brazen wooer

 Now he told him whenever he was going to make war with his land forces to divide his whole army into three squadrons each of which he was to pack into twenty ranks the centre squadron however he was to extend further than the rest by the number of twenty men

 But the man thought that death was not so bad as temperance and that it was easier to quit life than luxury and he again boiled the grain in water and then fermented the liquor whereupon despairing of any further plea to excuse his appetite he openly indulged in drink and turned to his cups again unabashed

 This done a favouring wind took them and they sailed to further Permland

 They wished to go over it but Gudmund restrained them telling them that by this channel nature had divided the world of men from the world of monsters and that no mortal track might go further

 Gudmund perceived that Thorkill was shrewder than he at every point so despairing to accomplish his treachery he carried them all across the further side of the river and let them finish their journey

 Thorkill s companions were very curious and he who well knew the reason of the matter told them that long ago the god Thor had been provoked by the insolence of the giants to drive red hot irons through the vitals of Geirrod who strove with him and that the iron had slid further torn up the mountain and battered through its side while the women had been stricken by the might of his thunderbolts and had been punished so he declared for their attempt on the same deity by having their bodies broken

 For the unusual diet first made a faintness steal gradually upon their stomachs then the infection spread further and the malady reached the vital parts

 Now at the upper end of this building sat the king s treasurer and in a line with him at its further end was displayed a round shield

 After Gotrik had crossed Friesland and Karl had now come back from Rome Gotrik determined to swoop down upon the further districts of Germany but was treacherously attacked by one of his own servants and perished at home by the sword of a traitor

 But even this did not sate his vengeance and he further determined to attack Saxony thinking it the refuge of his foes and the retreat of Harald

 This compassion shamed the Russians out of any further rage against such a king who could not be driven even by the most grievous wrongs to inflict death upon his prisoners

 If the Religion of Israel passed through the stages of totemism animism and polydemonism if it was indebted to Canaanite Kenite Babylonian Persian Greek and other foreign influences if it experienced a stage of monolatry or henotheism in which Israel recognised one God but did not think of that God as the only God of all men before ethical monotheism of the universalistic type was reached if further all these stages and the moral and religious ideas connected with each left a more or less clear mark in the sacred literature of Israel then the legacy which Judaism received from its past was a syncretism of the whole of the religious experiences of Israel as interpreted in the light of Israel s latest highest most approved standards

 Renewed with Moses and followed in traditional opinion by the Ten Commandments the Sinaitic Covenant was a further link in the bond between God and His people

 But as Professor Schechter justly writes Among the Maimonists we may probably include the great majority of Jews who accepted the Thirteen Articles without further question

 No further theory was required or possible

 But further than this a large portion of Jewish mysticism was the work of lawyers

 The further question therefore arises as to the mission of Israel in history to come as well as in history past

 Modern Jews think that in some respects the Rabbinic Judaism was an advance on the Biblical they think further that their own modern Judaism is an advance on the Rabbinic

 I can only suggest here and give a few examples of the wealth of material that awaits further detailed examination by other scholars

 Further insight into Johnson s knowledge of books of esoterica histories ballads etc

 Further Johnson s moral and religious sensibilities were offended by profanity and obscenity in the drama and Shakespeare s comedies far more than his tragedies and histories transgress in this direction

 Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond That this is the utmost extent of the prospect of ambition the point where the eye can pass no further and where objects lose their distinctness so that what is there discovered is faint obscure and doubtful

 ere you flout old ends any further examine your conscience Before you endeavour to distinguish yourself any more by antiquated allusions examine whether you can fairly claim them for your own 

 Let us carry critical temerity a little further

 Lysander in the language of love professes that as they have one heart they shall have one bed this Hernia thinks rather too much and intreats him to lye further off

 But as there are still many men who without ever having studied the question do not hesitate even in our days to throw barbarism in their teeth and attribute to it the pitiable condition which the Irish to day present to the world we add a few further considerations on this point

 As to China the great discoveries which in the hands of the European races have led to such wonderful results the mariner s compass the printing press gunpowder paper bank notes remained for the Chinese mere toys or without further improvements after their first discovery

 Thus in the beautiful legend of Ethne and Felimia the saint not content with instructing them on the attributes of God the Trinity and other supernatural truths goes further still he requires a change in their whole being that it be spiritualized by deeply exciting their feelings by speaking of Christ as their spouse by making them wish to receive him in the holy Eucharist even at the expense of their temporal life he so raises them above Nature that they actually asked to die

 But this statement whatever may be its intrinsic value itself needs a further explanation which is only to be found in the greater attraction the supernatural always possessed for the Irish nature when developed by grace

 When we consider that neither the Romans nor the Anglo Saxons ever obtained a footing in that country although they had conquered England the adjacent isle and when we further reflect upon the immense power exerted by the English in later times in order to subdue the Celtic population of the island we cannot help being surprised at the very considerable Scandinavian settlements which as early as the ninth century were formed in that country

 And the further fact that it was thought necessary to reenact those odious laws frequently in subsequent Irish Parliaments proves that they were not carried into execution since new legislation on the subject was demanded

 A necessity arose then on the part of the English rulers of adopting measures calculated to prevent a further acquisition of territory by the Irish if not to extend the English settlements

 and the book of common prayers with further alterations was reintroduced

 The remarks we have made may be further corroborated by the reflection that the successful risings of oppressed nationalities recorded in modern history were wholly effected by the unaided forces of the insurgents

 The dead do not come back and if the mothers and babies are slaughtered with the men the race gives no further trouble but the work must be done thoroughly partial and fitful cruelty lays up only a long debt of deserved and ever deepening hate

 Our purpose is not to inveigh against this judicial murder and by further details increase the horror which every honest man must feel at the narrative of such atrocious proceedings

 How came it then that the change which was absolutely impossible in Ireland was so easily effected in the other country Or to generalize the question How is it that to speak generally the nations of Northern Europe embraced Protestantism so readily while those of Southern Europe refused to receive it or were only slightly affected by it Ranke has remarked that when after the first outbreak in the North the movement had reached a certain point in time and space it stopped and instead of advancing further appeared to recede or at least stood still

 It is not possible to enter here into further details but if the reader wish for stronger proofs of the questioning spirit reasoning mistrust and systematic doggedness natural to the Scandinavian mind he has only to reflect on what took place in England at the time of the Reformation

 Since that first admission other non Catholic writers have gone further and have felt compelled to admit that as a general rule the modern European nations have all been created nurtured fostered by Catholic bishops and that the first free Parliaments of those nations were in fact councils of the Church either of a purely clerical character and altogether free from the intermixture of lay elements such as the Councils of Toledo in Spain or acting in concert with the representatives of the various classes in the nations

 A further fact stranger still and still more calculated to shake their confidence in the monarch occurred shortly after which indeed raises the loyalty of the nation to a height inconceivable and impossible to any people unless one whose conscience is swayed by the sense of stern duty

 Terrible moment for a nation when despair itself fails to nerve it for further resistance and possible success Such was the position of the Irish at the death of Charles

 Whoever wishes for further details of these sickening atrocities committed in the name of God may find them in a multitude of histories of the time but chiefly in the Threnodia of Friar Morrison

 To prove if necessary still further that the expatriation of the Irish troops was part of a scheme already resolved upon it is enough to remember the indisputable fact that from the surrender at Kilkenny in until the open announcement in the September of that the Parliament had assigned Connaught for the dwelling place of the Irish nation whither they were to be transplanted before the st of May the various garrisons and small armies which had fought so gallantly for Ireland and the Stuarts were successively urged and urged by Cromwell meant compelled to leave the country and it was only when the last of the Irish regiments had departed that the doom of the nation was boldly and clearly announced

 It is a wonder which cannot fail to strike the reader how after so many precautions had been taken not only against the further increase of the race but for its speedy demolition how reduced to a bare half million penned off on a barren tract of land left utterly at the mercy of its persecutors without priests without organization of any kind it not only failed to perish but from that time has gone on steadily increasing until to day it spreads out wide and far not only on the island of its birth but on the broad face of two vast continents

 But woman once she feels her power is exacting and in course of time the Cromwellian soldiers found that further sacrifices still were required of them which they had never counted upon

 No system of pretended religion invented by the perverted mind of man under the inspiration of the Evil One could go further in atrocity than this

 All its legislative spirit was concentrated in the two questions Are the laws already in existence against the further growth of Popery rigidly enforced and cannot some new law be introduced to further the same object

 All its legislative spirit was concentrated in the two questions Are the laws already in existence against the further growth of Popery rigidly enforced and cannot some new law be introduced to further the same object

 After that time it would in all likelihood have been impossible to improve further and render the yoke of slavery heavier and more galling to the Irish

 The forlorn hope of the Tory and Orange press went still further

 Pauperism then is the necessary misfortune not the crime of Ireland we may even go further and assert that if millions of Irishmen have lived and died paupers owing to the barbarous laws enacted for that special purpose few indeed among them have been reduced even by hard necessity and the extreme of misery to manifest a pauper spirit and a miserly bent

 The government was compelled to give way and allow the persecuted Catholics to enjoy without further molestation the private exercise of their religion

 Further details are not needed

 On this point probably all are agreed and therefore there is no need of further explanation

 Further words are unnecessary on this subject as the simple good sense and deep religious feeling of the Irish will easily preserve them from yielding to such temptation

 And when to this is added the further reflection that she is still young though sprung from so old an origin young in feeling in buoyancy in aspirations in purity and simplicity the conclusion forces itself upon the mind that a high destiny is in store for her and that God proposes a long era of prosperity and active life to an ancient nation which is only now beginning to live

 But the labor of striking the mine of opening those musty pages falling to pieces between the fingers and leaving in the hand nothing but illegible fragments of half blackened parchment and the further labor of deciphering them of discovering what they speak about and if they are likely to prove useful to the purposes

 A further fact recorded by the same historian shows what the feeling toward Catholics was at the time in Massachusetts The girl who knew herself to be a deceiver had no remorse and to the ministers it never occurred that vanity and love of power had blinded their judgment

 What must have been the consequent losses then Yet looking now in at the present state of the Church in the Union who can say that this inpouring and rush unprepared as the country was for its reception was not one of the greatest means devised by Providence not only for establishing the Catholic Church in this country for all time but likewise as a preparation for further developments not only on this continent but on the part of many a nation now sitting in the shadow of death Deplorable indeed were the losses but permanent and wonderful the gain

 To this may be added the remark that it is still further beyond doubt that all the establishments mentioned almost without one exception owe their existence at least partially and very often entirely to the generous and never failing contributions of the Irish

 Further details may be read in the book quoted from which would scarcely come well in these pages though quite appropriate to the most interesting work in which they appear

 In these districts Irishmen have found a new country something of the ubiquity of the English belongs to them and the influence power and weight thus thrown into their hands need no further comment

 This great German historian carries his views further still and confesses that if the political supports were in a tottering condition the moral were no less shattered

 The question here presented is indeed a complicated one requiring solid distinctions in order to elucidate it and strange to say this last difficulty of the presence of two nations in Ireland offers greater obstacles to the firm establishment of our opinion than the first assertion so clear and undeniable in appearance that there is no Irish nation If true nationality existed only in the externals of government in an army navy commerce a public seal and flag and recognition by foreign powers further discussion would clearly be useless and the subject might as well at once be dropped

 It imported that they were to consider of the funeral honours proper to be paid his deceased Father for himself he would not depart from the corpse and further than this edict implied he claimed no share in the public administration

 Men of deeper discernment entered further into his life but differed about it

 This register was all writ by the hand of Augustus and in it he had subjoined his counsel to posterity that the present boundaries of the Empire should stand fixed without further enlargement but whether this counsel was dictated by fear for the public or by envy towards his successors is uncertain

 After this no further authority remained to the Tribunes none to the Camp Marshals

 As to my wife and children whom for your glory I could freely sacrifice I now remove them from your rage that by my blood alone may be expiated whatever further mischief your fury meditates and that the murder of the great grandson of Augustus the murder of the daughter in law of Tiberius may not be added to mine nor to the blackness of your past guilt

 Against the recalling of Agrippina he alleged the advance of winter and her approaching delivery but said that his son should return and that to themselves he left to execute what remained further to be executed

 Further they beheld the ruinous entrenchment and the ditch nigh choked up in it the remains of the army were supposed to have made their last effort and in it to have found their graves

 Fronto went further and desired that the quantities of silver plate the expense of furniture and the number of domestics might be limited for it was yet common for senators to depart from the present debate and offer as their advice whatever they judged conducing to the interest of the commonweal

 Nor did Tiberius ever show further pity though the house of Hortensius was fallen into shameful distress

 As they coasted Lycia and Pamphilia they encountered the ships which carried Agrippina with hostile spirit on each side and each at first prepared for combat but as equal dread of one another possessed both proceeded not further than mutual contumelies

 After this fatal warning he doubted whether he should make any further efforts but by the advice of his sons fortifying his mind he again entered the Senate there he found the prosecution renewed suffered the declared indignation of the Fathers and saw all things cross and terrible but nothing so much daunted him as to behold Tiberius without mercy without wrath close dark unmovable and bent against every access of tenderness

 When he was brought home as if he were preparing for his further defence the next day he wrote somewhat which he sealed and delivered to his freedman he then washed and anointed and took the usual care of his person

 The secret and constant purposes of my own heart towards you and with what further ties of affinity I am contriving to bind you still faster to me I at present forbear to recount

 The ground of their late commotion not to mention the savage genius of the people was their scorn and impatience to have recruits raised amongst them and all their stoutest men enlisted in our armies accustomed as they were not even to obey their native kings further than their own humour nor to aid them with forces but under captains of their own choosing nor to fight against any enemy but their own borderers

 The genius of Druses naturally furious instigated besides by a passion for power and by the usual hate and competition between brothers was further kindled by the partiality of Agrippina who was fonder of Nero

 Here begins a lamentable chasm in this Annal for almost three years and by it we have lost the detail of the most remarkable incidents in this reign the exile of Agrippina into the Isle of Pandataria of Nero into that of Pontia and the murder of both there by the orders of Tiberius the conspiracy and execution of Sejanus with that of all his friends and dependents the further wickedness of Livia and her death

 They likewise wear the skins of savage beasts a dress which those bordering upon the Rhine use without any fondness or delicacy but about which such who live further in the country are more curious as void of all apparel introduced by commerce

 Thus as they have but one body and one life they take but one husband that beyond him they may have no thought no further wishes nor love him only as their husband but as their marriage

 What further accounts we have are fabulous as that the Hellusians and Oxiones have the countenances and aspect of men with the bodies and limbs of savage beasts

 In the beginning of this reign all the exercise of power and the government of the city were entirely in the hands of Mucianus for Domitian was yet extremely young and of the Imperial fortune of his father assumed nothing further than a latitude for debauchery

 Nor have the Romans any further subdued them than only to obey just laws but never to submit to be slaves

 Afterwards followed Didius Gallus and just preserved what acquisitions his predecessors had made only that further in the island he raised some forts and very few they were purely for the name and opinion of having enlarged his government

 Their patience they said availed them nothing further than to invite the imposition of heavier burdens upon a people who thus tamely bore any

 Turpilianus when he had quite appeased the late commotions ventured upon nothing further and then delivered the Province to Trebellius Maximus

 For besides that bondage is what we have never borne we are so beset that beyond us there is no further land nor in truth is there any security left us from the sea whilst the Roman fleet is hovering upon our coasts

 Then said the king If thou wilt not yield in this i faith I approve thy choice and will further thee therein as I best can

 Of them I will tell no further

 She said further Dear lord for my love help me thereto that Siegfried and thy sister visit us and that we see them here

 The king spake further They come to morrow early

 Brunhild stopped before the minster with her women for she thought Kriemhild the foul mouthed woman shall tell me further whereof she so loud accuseth me

 Said Siegfried further If she rejoiceth to have troubled thy fair wife I am grieved beyond measure

 Yet none had urged it further had not Hagen tempted Gunther every day saying that if Siegfried lived not many kings lands were subject to him

 Then said Siegfried further Have no fear

 A glad man was King Gunther when he heard that Said Siegfried further Nay I will undertake more

 With a groan the wounded man said further Yet if thou canst show truth to any on this earth O King show it to my dear wife that I commend to thee

 These days had the further distinction that while they lasted the color of the manna sparkled more than usual and it tasted better than usual

 The spot where this occurred God called Massah and Meribah because Israel had there tried their God saying If God is Lord over all as over us if He satisfies our needs and will further show us that He knows our thoughts then will we serve Him but not otherwise

 Moses of course was not deceived about their true sentiments still he paid no further attention to them and picked out the best men among the people though they were not possessed of nearly all the good qualities Jethro had thought essential for judges and leaders of people

 But when they there beheld the priests the Levites and the noblest of the Jews they said How can we proselytes presume to sit beside these Instead of sitting within the house of instruction they remained at the entrance of it where they listened to the lectures and in this manner made further progress in the study of the Torah

 Mount Sinai has a further significance too for it had been originally a part of Mount Moriah on which Isaac was to have been sacrificed but Sinai separated itself from it and came to the desert

 Although the people had now clearly expressed their desire to accept the Torah still God hesitated to give it to them saying Shall I without further ado give you the Torah Nay bring Me bondsmen that you will observe it and I will give you the Torah

 Were ye perchance enslaved in Egypt and then delivered that ye are in need of the Torah It is further written in the Torah Thou shalt have no other gods

 The three Patriarchs united their prayers with those of Moses who said to God Hast Thou not made a vow to these three to multiply their seed as the stars and are they now to be destroyed In recognition of the merits of these three pious men God called away three of the Angels of Destruction leaving only two whereupon Moses further importuned God For the vow Thou madest to Israel take from them the angel Mashhit and God granted his prayer

 Only for Israel s sake have I caused this honor to fall to thy lot but now that Israel has become disloyal to Me I have not further reason thus to distinguish thee

 These words indicated to Moses that God was not yet entirely appeased and he could further see this in the punishment that fell upon Israel on that day

 When Moses saw from this that God s wrath was still upon Israel and that He desired to have nothing further to do with them he removed his tent a mile away from the camp saying to himself The disciple may not have intercourse with people whom the master has excommunicated

 For God merely stated that He also shows Himself kind to those who do not deserve it but without further assigning the why and the wherefore

 Moses further said to God O Lord of the world To our father Abraham Thou made the following promises And I will make thy seed as the stars in the heavens but now Thou biddest me number Israel

 It was a battered and crippled host that reached Sinai eager to receive the Torah but God said Does it become the glory of the Torah that I should bestow it on a race of cripples Nor do I want to await the coming of another sound generation for I desire no further delay of the revelation of the Torah

 THE UNGRATEFUL MULTITUDE When God commanded Israel to set out from Sinai and continue their march the Israelites were glad for during their stay in that place they had throughout eleven days received new laws daily and they hoped that after having departed from the holy mountain they would receive no further laws

 Carried away by anger Moses still further forgot himself and instead of speaking to the rock as God had commanded him he struck a rock chosen by himself

 If then thou are a wise man it does not become thee as a wise man to have anything further to do with fools and therefore thou shalt not with them learn to know the land of Israel

 As Aaron in his simplicity did not notice the allusion Moses did not go into further particulars but remarked to Aaron God hath with justice called thee an innocent simple hearted man

 Their fear was still further increased by their belief that Israel would pay no attention to God s command to them not to wage war against Lot s descendants

 Balaam s plan was to insult Balak so that he should send no further messengers to him and no one might discover that he could accomplish nothing beyond the word of God

 Most of the princes had deserted their king without awaiting Balaam for they expected nothing further from him after the first disappointment he had caused them

 CURSES TURNED TO BLESSINGS Balaam on the other hand made no further attempts to induce God to curse Israel but thought he might be able to bring misfortune upon Israel by enumerating the sins they had committed in the desert and in this way to conjure up God s wrath against them

 Now Moses might well have decided this case without further ado but in his meekness he thought There is still a higher authority than I to wit God and he bade them await God s judgement

 Lot s descendants now not only had no further claims to exemption but a command was given to Moses to treat them with still greater hostility than the other nations

 It is commonly supposed to be carried furthest in some very trifling ones not perhaps that it really is carried further in them than in others of more importance but in those trifling manufactures which are destined to supply the small wants of but a small number of people the whole number of workmen must necessarily be small and those employed in every different branch of the work can often be collected into the same workhouse and placed at once under the view of the spectator

 Whether this propensity be one of those original principles in human nature of which no further account can be given or whether as seems more probable it be the necessary consequence of the faculties of reason and speech it belongs not to our present subject to inquire

 It was at an end therefore long before the most considerable improvements were made in the productive powers of labour and it would be to no purpose to trace further what might have been its effects upon the recompence or wages of labour

 But though North America is not yet so rich as England it is much more thriving and advancing with much greater rapidity to the further acquisition of riches

 But in civilized society it is only among the inferior ranks of people that the scantiness of subsistence can set limits to the further multiplication of the human species and it can do so in no other way than by destroying a great part of the children which their fruitful marriages produce

 It deserves to be remarked perhaps that it is in the progressive state while the society is advancing to the further acquisition rather than when it has acquired its full complement of riches that the condition of the labouring poor of the great body of the people seems to be the happiest and the most comfortable

 In a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which the nature of its soil and climate and its situation with respect to other countries allowed it to acquire which could therefore advance no further and which was not going backwards both the wages of labour and the profits of stock would probably be very low

 The long time and the great expense which must be laid out in their education when combined with this circumstance necessarily enhance still further the price of their labour

 As every person in a parish therefore was supposed to have an interest to prevent as much as possible their being burdened by such intruders it was further enacted by the rd of William III

 And in order to give the most perfect security to the parish where such certificated man should come to reside it was further enacted by the same statute that he should gain no settlement there by any means whatever except either by renting a tenement of ten pounds a year or by serving upon his own account in an annual parish office for one whole year and consequently neither by notice nor by service nor by apprenticeship nor by paying parish rates

 it was further enacted that neither the servants nor apprentices of such certificated man should gain any settlement in the parish where he resided under such certificate

 But in the course of these sixty four years there happened two events which must have produced a much greater scarcity of corn than what the course of the season is would otherwise have occasioned and which therefore without supposing any further reduction in the value of silver will much more than account for this very small enhancement of price

 In accordingly the further exportation of corn was prohibited for nine months

 made it necessary to reduce it from one fifth to one tenth may in time make it necessary to reduce it still further in the same manner as it made it necessary to reduce the tax upon gold to one twentieth

 In countries ill cultivated and therefore but thinly inhabited the price of the wool and the hide bears always a much greater proportion to that of the whole beast than in countries where improvement and population being further advanced there is more demand for butcher s meat

 There are perhaps no manufactures in which the division of labour can be carried further or in which the machinery employed admits of a greater variety of improvements than those of which the materials are the coarser metals

 That rise in the real price of those parts of the rude produce of land which is first the effect of the extended improvement and cultivation and afterwards the cause of their being still further extended the rise in the price of cattle for example tends too to raise the rent of land directly and in a still greater proportion

 Secondly it may be employed in the improvement of land in the purchase of useful machines and instruments of trade or in such like things as yield a revenue or profit without changing masters or circulating any further

 which compose the fixed capital bear this further resemblance to that part of the circulating capital which consists in money that as every saving in the expense of erecting and supporting those machines which does not diminish the introductive powers of labour is an improvement of the neat revenue of the society so every saving in the expense of collecting and supporting that part of the circulating capital which consists in money is an improvement of exactly the same kind

 But in what manner this operation is performed and in what manner it tends to increase either the gross or the neat revenue of the society is not altogether so obvious and may therefore require some further explication

 The coffers of the bank so far as its dealings are confined to such customers resemble a water pond from which though a stream is continually running out yet another is continually running in fully equal to that which runs out so that without any further care or attention the pond keeps always equally or very near equally full

 so that without any further care or attention those coffers are likely to be always equally or very near equally full and scarce ever to require any extraordinary expense to replenish them

 These are things in which further expense is frequently rendered unnecessary by former expense and when a person stops short he appears to do so not because he has exceeded his fortune but because he has satisfied his fancy

 Were the Americans either by combination or by any other sort of violence to stop the importation of European manufactures and by thus giving a monopoly to such of their own countrymen as could manufacture the like goods divert any considerable part of their capital into this employment they would retard instead of accelerating the further increase in the value of their annual produce and would obstruct instead of promoting the progress of their country towards real wealth and greatness

 The butcher the brewer and the baker soon join them together with many other artificers and retailers necessary or useful for supplying their occasional wants and who contribute still further to augment the town

 It could never however be the interest even of this last species of cultivators to lay out in the further improvement of the land any part of the little stock which they might save from their own share of the produce because the landlord who laid out nothing was to get one half of whatever it produced

 When such farmers have a lease for a term of years they may sometimes find it for their interest to lay out part of their capital in the further improvement of the farm because they may sometimes expect to recover it with a large profit before the expiration of the lease

 The lands cultivated by the farmer must in the same manner with only equal good conduct be improved more slowly than those cultivated by the proprietor on account of the large share of the produce which is consumed in the rent and which had the farmer been proprietor he might have employed in the further improvement of the land

 They are thus both encouraged and enabled to increase this surplus produce by a further improvement and better cultivation of the land and as the fertility of she land had given birth to the manufacture so the progress of the manufacture reacts upon the land and increases still further it s fertility

 The increase and riches of commercial and manufacturing towns contributed to the improvement and cultivation of the countries to which they belonged in three different ways First by affording a great and ready market for the rude produce of the country they gave encouragement to its cultivation and further improvement

 His tenants could agree to this upon one condition only that they should be secured in their possession for such a term of years as might give them time to recover with profit whatever they should lay not in the further improvement of the land

 It is therefore unnecessary to say any thing further about either

 The legislature were it possible that its deliberations could be always directed not by the clamorous importunity of partial interests but by an extensive view of the general good ought upon this very account perhaps to be particularly careful neither to establish any new monopolies of this kind nor to extend further those which are already established

 The society in this case lives within its revenue and what is annually saved out of its revenue is naturally added to its capital and employed so as to increase still further the annual produce

 The bounty upon the exportation of corn is liable to this further objection that it can in no respect promote the raising of that particular commodity of which it was meant to encourage the production

 Subsequent laws still further increased those duties

 The public trade of the company extends no further than the trade with Europe and comprehends a part only of the foreign trade of the country

 It is unnecessary I apprehend at present to say anything further in order to expose the folly of a system which fatal experience has now sufficiently exposed

 They have obtained likewise the drawback of two thirds of the excise duties imposed upon their commodity even when exported without further manufacture

 If you except horses all these are either materials of manufacture or incomplete manufactures which may be considered as materials for still further manufacture or instruments of trade

 Whatever besides tends to diminish in any country the number of artificers and manufacturers tends to diminish the home market the most important of all markets for the rude produce of the land and thereby still further to discourage agriculture

 The great change introduced into the art of war by the invention of fire arms has enhanced still further both the expense of exercising and disciplining any particular number of soldiers in time of peace and that of employing them in time of war

 They were attempting about this time to raise it still further to twelve and a half per cent

 But during the two years in which their agreement with government was to take place they were restrained from any further increase of dividend by two successive acts of parliament of which the object was to enable them to make a speedier progress in the payment of their debts which were at this time estimated at upwards of six or seven millions sterling

 In such a situation he would have no occasion to give himself any concern about them further than to keep the peace among them in the same manner as among the rest of his subjects that is to hinder them from persecuting abusing or oppressing one another

 That he should go so far though he went no further gave some satisfaction to the patrons of the reformation who having got possession of the government in the reign of his son and successor completed without any difficulty the work which Henry VIII

 which reductions still further augmented the sinking fund

 The Spanish war which began in and the French war which soon followed it occasioned a further increase of the debt which on the st of December after the war had been concluded by the treaty of Aix la Chapelle amounted to 

 The public expense however when defrayed in this manner no doubt hinders more or less the further accumulation of new capital but it does not necessarily occasion the destruction of any actually existing capital

 This apology is founded altogether in the sophistry of the mercantile system and after the long examination which I have already bestowed upon that system it may perhaps be unnecessary to say anything further about it

 Since the peace agriculture has been still further improved the rents of houses have risen in every town and village of the country a proof of the increasing wealth and revenue of the people and the annual amount of the greater part of the old taxes of the principal branches of the excise and customs in particular has been continually increasing an equally clear proof of an increasing consumption and consequently of an increasing produce which could alone support that consumption

 The calamity too would extend much further than to the creditors of the public and those of every private person would suffer a proportionable loss and this without any advantage but in most cases with a great additional loss to the creditors of the public

 The debtor for fear of a very severe execution was obliged without any further gratuity to vote for the candidate whom the creditor recommended

 In the course of the second Punic war the As was still further reduced first from two ounces of copper to one ounce and afterwards from one ounce to half an ounce that is to the twenty fourth part of its original value

 The most sanguine projector however could scarce flatter himself that any augmentation of this kind would be such as could give any reasonable hopes either of liberating the public revenue altogether or even of making such progress towards that liberation in time of peace as either to prevent or to compensate the further accumulation of the public debt in the next war

 A further consideration of the true nature of beauty and therefore of the vocation of the artist will aid us still more in our endeavor to show the high dignity of art and of aesthetics

 It is our purpose after the previous discussion to attempt to elucidate still further the idea of art by following its historic development

 A recent exponent of Hegel s aesthetical ideas further developed expresses himself thus on the nature of beauty After the bitterness of the world the sweetness of art soothes and refreshes us

 We feel in it the harmony of the world it breaks forth in a beauty in a lovely accord in a radiant point and starting thence we penetrate further and yet further and find as the ground of all existence the same charm which had refreshed us in individual forms

 The course of events has given a direction to the genius of the time that threatens to remove it continually further from the ideal of art

 We are free to admit such is their language that the charms of the beautiful can further honorable ends in pure hands but it is not repugnant to its nature to produce in impure hands a directly contrary effect and to employ in the service of injustice and error the power that throws the soul of man into chains

 Be pleased to follow me a few steps further and a large horizon will open up to yon and a delightful prospect will reward you for the labor of the way

 Accordingly the personal worth of a man or his dignity as far as this can only depend on himself remains entirely undetermined by aesthetic culture and nothing further is attained than that on the part of nature it is made profitable for him to make of himself what he will that the freedom to be what he ought to be is restored perfectly to him

 For in this she acts in common with our original creator nature which has imparted to us nothing further than this capacity for humanity but leaves the use of it to our own determination of will

 However the intelligence only shows this vigorous spirit when it calls to mind the affinity pointed out further back

 Doubtless that would hold an incontestably higher rank in the order of pure spirits as they would need neither the attraction of the beautiful nor the perspective of eternal life to conform on every occasion to the demands of reason but we know man is short sighted and his feebleness forces the most rigid moralist to temper in some degree the rigidity of his system in practice although he will yield nothing in theory it obliges him in order to insure the welfare of the human race which would be ill protected by a virtue subjected to chance to have further recourse to two strong anchors those of religion and taste

 We find here realized the first of the three conditions of the sublime that have been mentioned further back a very powerful natural force armed for destruction and ridiculing all resistance

 It goes still further for even the beauty of form it restricts within the limits of the human species in which as we know the Greeks included also their gods

 Free activity which is truly at home only in Olympus was introduced by him even into the domain of sense and it is a further reason for not attaching blame to him if reciprocally he transported the affections of the sense into Olympus

 From thence it is to the mind to decide the use it will make of its instruments and with regard to that part of beauty which depends on this use nature has nothing further to command nor consequently to incur any responsibility

 It is true the intention of nature may go here much further and the means she employs to reach her end may offer in their combination more of art and complication but all that ought to be placed solely to the account of nature and can confer no advantage on man himself

 In truth without going further common sense considers ease to be the first requisite of grace

 Further it is grace alone which guarantees and accredits dignity and dignity alone can give value to grace

 But even further limitations are necessary in this innocent subserviency to the senses which is only allowed in the form without changing anything in the substance

 This is not the place to pursue this thought any further as it would require a separate discussion to place it in its full light

 But my object is not here to write a history of German poetry I only wished to clear up what I said further back by some examples from our literature

 It has been observed further back that a mere disposition to frivolity of mind to a merry humor if a certain fund of the ideal is not joined to it does not suffice to constitute the vocation of a satirical poet though this mistake is frequently made

 It would further result that this pleasure is an aim which can never be attained but by moral means and consequently that art to tend and perfectly attain to pleasure as to a real aim must follow the road of healthy morals

 Your way leads onwards and you require no further precautions

 Still further

 Further the irritability of the muscles was held to consist in a certain effort to contract themselves on the touch of some external provocation

 Further since the body is subjected to all the consequences of this connection and in the circle of circumstances is exposed to countless hostile forces it must be within the power of the soul to protect the body against these harmful influences and to bring it into such relations with the physical world as shall tend most to its preservation

 Were then the sensations of our animal loss or well being to become spiritual perceptions and had they to be created by thought how often would the soul be obscured by the overwhelming blaze of passion how often stifled by laziness and stupidity how often overlooked in the absorptions and distractions of business Further would not in this case the most perfect knowledge of his economy be demanded of the animal man would not the child need to be a master in a branch of knowledge in which after fifty years of investigation Harvey Boerhaave and Haller were only beginners The soul could thus have positively no idea of the condition she was called upon to alter

 And up again about six Lord s day and being dressed in my velvett coate and plain cravatte took a hackney coach provided ready for me by eight o clock and so to my Lord Bruncker s with all my papers and there took his coach with four horses and away toward Hampton Court having a great deale of good discourse with him particularly about his coming to lie at the office when I went further in inviting him to than I intended having not yet considered whether it will be convenient for me or no to have him here so near us and then of getting Mr

 As we were going further in comes my Lord Mandeville so we were forced to breake off and I away and to Sir W

 Thence further to Westminster thinking to have met Mrs

 So to Westminster and there at the Swan got a bit of meat and dined alone and so away toward King s Street and spying out of my coach Jane that lived heretofore at Jevons my barber s I went a little further and stopped and went on foot back and overtook her taking water at Westminster Bridge and spoke to her and she telling me whither she was going I over the water and met her at Lambeth and there drank with her she telling me how he that was so long her servant did prove to be a married man though her master told me which she denies that he had lain with her several times in his house

 By and by walking a little further Sir Philip Frowde did meet the Duke with an expresse to Sir W

 He tells me further how the Duke of Yorke is wholly given up to his new mistresse my Lady Denham going at noon day with all his gentlemen with him to visit her in Scotland Yard she declaring she will not be his mistresse as Mrs

 This day arrived a trumpet from the States of Holland who came over from Calais in the Dover packet boat with a letter to his Majesty that the States have taken order for the embalming the body of Sir William Berkeley which they have placed in the chapel of the great church at the Hague a civility they profess to owe to his corpse in respect to the quality of his person the greatness of his command and of the high courage and valour he showed in the late engagement desiring his Majesty to signify his pleasure about the further disposal of it

 He tells me further that having been downe with the Duke of Albemarle he finds that Holmes and Spragge do govern most business of the Navy and by others I understand that Sir Thomas Allen is offended thereat that he is not so much advised with as he ought to be

 Coventry did further say concerning Warcupp his kinsman that had the simplicity to tell Sir W

 About seven rose again to dress myself and there looked out at the window and saw the fire not so much as it was and further off

 Poor Michell s house as far as the Old Swan already burned that way and the fire running further that in a very little time it got as far as the Steeleyard while I was there

 They now removing out of Canning streets which received goods in the morning into Lumbard streets and further and among others I now saw my little goldsmith Stokes receiving some friend s goods whose house itself was burned the day after

 Carcasse and his brother whom I met in the streets and carried them below and above bridge to and again to see the fire which was now got further both below and above and no likelihood of stopping it

 Hater Gibson and Tom alone got all my chests and money into the further cellar with much pains but great content to me when done

 He did further discourse of Sir W

 I am told also how Holmes did last Sunday deliver in his articles to the King and Cabinet against Sir Jeremy Smith and that Smith hath given in his answer and lays his not accompanying the fleete to his pilot who would not undertake to carry the ship further which the pilot acknowledges

 The Revenge having her forecastle blown up with powder to the killing of some men in the River and the Dyamond s being overset in the careening at Sheernesse are further marks of the method all the King s work is now done in

 He says the House goes on slowly in finding of money and that the discontented party do say they have not done with us for they will have a further bout with us as to our accounts and they are exceedingly well instructed where to hit us

 It was referred to further examination but the Duke of York declared that as he would not favour disobedience so neither drunkenness and therein he said very well

 Going further I met my late Lord Mayor Bludworth under whom the City was burned and went with him by water to White Hall

 And more they produce precedents for it namely that against new buildings and about leather wherein the word Nuisance is used to the purpose and further that they do not rob the King of any right he ever had for he never had a power to do hurt to his people nor would exercise it and therefore there is no danger in the passing this Bill of imposing on his prerogative and concluded that they think they ought to do this so as the people may really have the benefit of it when it is passed for never any people could expect so reasonably to be indulged something from a King they having already given him so much money and are likely to give more

 So though I get nothing at present at least by the estate I am fain to pay this money rather than rob my father and much good may it do them that I may have no more further trouble from them

 Here we took her before she was up which I was sorry for so only saw her and away to chapel leaving further visit till after sermon

 And the Duke of York said further What said Marshal Turenne when some in vanity said that the enemies were afraid for they entrenched themselves Well says he I would they were not afraid for then they would not entrench themselves and so we could deal with them the better

 Cholmly tells me further that he is confident there will be a peace and that a great man did tell him that my Lord Albemarle did tell him the other day at White Hall as a secret that we should have a peace if any thing the King of France can ask and our King can give will gain it which he is it seems mad at

 Pen and I confess the very thoughts of what our goods will come to when we have them do discourage me in going any further in the adventure

 Carteret hath nothing to do to look after money but if he will undertake my Lord Treasurer s work to raise money of the Bankers then people must expect that he will do it and did further say that he Carteret and my Lord Chancellor do at this very day labour all they can to villify this new way of raising money and making it payable as it now is into the Exchequer and expressly said that in pursuance hereof my Lord Chancellor hath prevailed with the King in the close of his last speech to the House to say that he did hope to see them come to give money as it used to be given without so many provisos meaning as Sir W

 Batten ordering the disposal of our wines and goods and he leaves it to Morrice the cooper who I take to be a cunning proud knave so that I am very desirous to adventure no further

 I then to dinner and then down the river to Greenwich and the watermen would go no further

 James s and there the Duke of York was preparing to go to some further ceremonies about the Garter that he could give us no audience

 Batten s to talk and there vexed to see them give order for Hogg s further abroad and so home and to bed

 His father married a Pepys in discourse he told me further that his grandfather my great grandfather had L per annum in Queen Elizabeth s time in the very town of Cottenham and that we did certainly come out of Scotland with the Abbot of Crowland

 So though I intend Gibson no further than to Huntingdon I direct him to send the packet forward

 The King and Duke of York up and down all the day here and there some time on Tower Hill where the City militia was where the King did make a speech to them that they should venture themselves no further than he would himself

 Pen sent me to see that the Dutch are come up to the Nore again and he knows not whether further or no and would have therefore several things done ships sunk and I know not what which Sir W

 It seems very remarkable to me and of great honour to the Dutch that those of them that did go on shore to Gillingham though they went in fear of their lives and were some of them killed and notwithstanding their provocation at Schelling yet killed none of our people nor plundered their houses but did take some things of easy carriage and left the rest and not a house burned and which is to our eternal disgrace that what my Lord Douglas s men who come after them found there they plundered and took all away and the watermen that carried us did further tell us that our own soldiers are far more terrible to those people of the country towns than the Dutch themselves

 Ford the good account which the boys had given of their understanding the nature and consequence of an oath and now my own observation of the sobriety and readiness of their answers further than of any man of any rank that come to give witness this day though some men of years and learning I was a little amazed and fully satisfied that they ought to have as much credit as the rest

 Coventry is come from Bredah as was expected but contrary to expectation brings with him two or three articles which do not please the King as to retrench the Act of Navigation and then to ascertain what are contraband goods and then that those exiled persons who are or shall take refuge in their country may be secure from any further prosecution

 He tells me further that the Duke of Buckingham was before the Council the other day and there did carry it very submissively and pleasingly to the King but to my Lord Arlington who do prosecute the business he was most bitter and sharp and very slighting

 Coventry and so home and there find my wife in a dogged humour for my not dining at home and I did give her a pull by the nose and some ill words which she provoked me to by something she spoke that we fell extraordinarily out insomuch that I going to the office to avoid further anger she followed me in a devilish manner thither and with much ado I got her into the garden out of hearing to prevent shame and so home and by degrees I found it necessary to calme her and did and then to the office where pretty late and then to walk with her in the garden and so to supper and pretty good friends and so to bed with my mind very quiet

 The Duke of Buckingham is it seems set at liberty without any further charge against him or other clearing of him but let to go out which is one of the strangest instances of the fool s play with which all publick things are done in this age that is to be apprehended

 And further he told us that this new way used by Deane and this Sir W

 The Speaker they found was kept from coming in the morning to the House on purpose till after the King was come to the House of Lords for fear they should be doing anything in the House of Commons to the further dissatisfaction of the King and his courtiers

 My Lord Bristoll took his place in the House of Lords this day but not in his robes and when the King come in he withdrew but my Lord of Buckingham was there as brisk as ever and sat in his robes which is a monstrous thing that a man proclaimed against and put in the Tower and all and released without any trial and yet not restored to his places But above all I saw my Lord Mordaunt as merry as the best that it seems hath done such further indignities to Mr

 Here talking of news my Lord Anglesey did tell us that the Dutch do make a further bogle with us about two or three things which they will be satisfied in he says by us easily but only in one it seems they do demand that we shall not interrupt their East Indiamen coming home and of which they are in some fear and we are full of hopes that we have light upon some of them and carried them into Lisbon by Harman which God send But they which do shew the low esteem they have of us have the confidence to demand that we shall have a cessation on our parts and yet they at liberty to take what they will which is such an affront as another cannot be devised greater

 So having put it past further dispute I away satisfied and took coach and to the King s playhouse and there saw The Country Captain which is a very ordinary play

 Dunstan s Church where I heard an able sermon of the minister of the place and stood by a pretty modest maid whom I did labour to take by the hand and the body but she would not but got further and further from me and at last I could perceive her to take pins out of her pocket to prick me if I should touch her again which seeing I did forbear and was glad I did spy her design

 Coventry may in himself have further designs and so that though other changes may come yet they shall be accidental and laid upon not good principles of doing good

 Townsend answered want of money and the owing of the linen draper L and that he hath of late got many rich things made beds and sheets and saddles and all without money and he can go no further but still this old man indeed like an old loving servant did cry out for the King s person to be neglected

 Up betimes and drinking my morning draught of strong water with Betty Michell I had not opportunity para baiser la I by water to White Hall and there met Creed and thence with him to Westminster Hall where we talked long together of news and there met with Cooling my Lord Chamberlain s Secretary and from him learn the truth of all I heard last night and understand further that this stiffness of the Lords is in no manner of kindness to my Lord Chancellor for he neither hath nor do nor for the future likely can oblige any of them but rather the contrary but that they do fear what the consequence may be to themselves should they yield in his case as many of them have reason

 That the business the other night of my Lord Anglesey at the Council was happily got over for my Lord by his dexterous silencing it and the rest not urging it further forasmuch as had the Duke of Buckingham come in time enough and had got it by the end he would have toused him in it Sir W

 This troubled me so much as together with the shortness of the time and muchness of the business did let me be at it till but about ten at night and then quite weary and dull and vexed I could go no further but resolved to leave the rest to to morrow morning and so in full discontent and weariness did give over and went home with out supper vexed and sickish to bed and there slept about three hours but then waked and never in so much trouble in all my life of mind thinking of the task I have upon me and upon what dissatisfactory grounds and what the issue of it may be to me

 Here I did do a little business and then to rights home and there dispatched many papers and so home late to supper and to bed being eased of a great many thoughts and yet have a great many more to remove as fast as I can my mind being burdened with them having been so much employed upon the public business of the office in their defence before the Parliament of late and the further cases that do attend it

 After dinner by water from the Tower to White Hall there to attend the Duke of York as usual and particularly in a fresh complaint the Commissioners of the Treasury do make to him and by and by to the Council this day of our having prepared certificates on the Exchequer to the further sum of near L and soon as we had done with the Duke of York we did attend the Council and were there called in and did hear Mr

 So to the office and did some business and then by coach to the New Exchange and there by agreement at my bookseller s shop met Mercer and Gayet and took them by water first to one of the Neat houses where walked in the garden but nothing but a bottle of wine to be had though pleased with seeing the garden and so to Fox Hall where with great pleasure we walked and then to the upper end of the further retired walk and there sat and sang and brought great many gallants and fine people about us and upon the bench we did by and by eat and drink what we had and very merry and so with much pleasure to the Old Swan and walked with them home and there left them and so I home to my business at the office a little and so to bed

 But when I come home hoping for a further degree of peace and quiet I find my wife upon her bed in a horrible rage afresh calling me all the bitter names and rising did fall to revile me in the bitterest manner in the world and could not refrain to strike me and pull my hair which I resolved to bear with and had good reason to bear it

 Coventry s and with him by coach to White Hall and there walked in the garden talking of several things and by my visit to keep fresh my interest in him and there he tells me how it hath been talked that he was to go one of the Commissioners to Ireland which he was resolved never to do unless directly commanded for he told me that for to go thither while the Chief Secretary of State was his professed enemy was to undo himself and therefore it were better for him to venture being unhappy here than to go further off to be undone by some obscure instructions or whatever other way of mischief his enemies should cut out for him

 I followed her and took occasion in the new passage now built where the walke is to be to take her by the hand to lead her through which she willingly accepted and I led her to the Great Gate and there left her she telling me of her own accord that she was going as far as Charing Cross but my boy was at the gate and so je durst not go out con her which vexed me and my mind God forgive me did run apres her toute that night though I have reason to thank God and so I do now that I was not tempted to go further

 Coventry at his house where I bless God he is come again but in my way I met him and so he took me into his coach and carried me to White Hall and there set me down where he ought not at least he hath not yet leave to come nor hath thought fit to ask it hearing that Henry Saville is not only denied to kiss the King s hand but the King being asked it by the Duke of York did deny it and directed that the Duke shall not receive him to wait upon him in his chamber till further orders

 Coventry s there to talk with him about business of the Navy and received from him direction what to advise the Duke of York at this time which was to submit and give way to the King s naming a man or two that the people about him have a mind should be brought into the Navy and perhaps that may stop their fury in running further against the whole and this he believes will do it

 I went therefore to them this afternoon to understand what monies they meant where they answered me by saying The eleven months tax customs and prizemoney without mentioning any more than I demanding the service they respected therein and so without further discourse we parted upon very good terms of respect and with few words but my mind not fully satisfied about the monies they mean

 His measured springless walk was the walk of the skilled countryman as distinct from the desultory shamble of the general labourer while in the turn and plant of each foot there was further a dogged and cynical indifference personal to himself showing its presence even in the regularly interchanging fustian folds now in the left leg now in the right as he paced along

 Moreover every shop pitched out half its contents upon trestles and boxes on the kerb extending the display each week a little further and further into the roadway despite the expostulations of the two feeble old constables until there remained but a tortuous defile for carriages down the centre of the street which afforded fine opportunities for skill with the reins

 Lucetta s words went no further and after this day she was so much upon her guard that there appeared no chance of her identification with the young Jersey woman who had been Henchard s dear comrade at a critical time

 Whether because Lucetta heard this low dialogue or not her white figure disappeared from her doorway inward and the door was shut before Henchard could reach it to converse with her further

 However when Stubberd had rambled on a little further Henchard broke out impatiently Come we don t want to hear any more of them cust dees and bees Say the words out like a man and don t be so modest Stubberd or else leave it alone Turning to the woman Now then have you any questions to ask him or anything to say Yes she replied with a twinkle in her eye and the clerk dipped his pen

 That the road they were following had up to this point been Henchard s track on foot they were pretty certain but the ramifications which now began to reveal themselves in the route made further progress in the right direction a matter of pure guess work and Donald strongly advised his wife to give up the search in person and trust to other means for obtaining news of her stepfather

 Why should their Lord Envy them that Can it be sin to know Can it be death And do they only stand By ignorance Is that their happy state The proof of their obedience and their faith O fair foundation laid whereon to build Their ruin hence I will excite their minds With more desire to know and to reject Envious commands invented with design To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt Equal with Gods aspiring to be such They taste and die What likelier can ensue But first with narrow search I must walk round This garden and no corner leave unspied A chance but chance may lead where I may meet Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side Or in thick shade retired from him to draw What further would be learned

 Which when the Lord God heard without delay To judgement he proceeded on the accused Serpent though brute unable to transfer The guilt on him who made him instrument Of mischief and polluted from the end Of his creation justly then accursed As vitiated in nature More to know Concerned not Man since he no further knew Nor altered his offence yet God at last To Satan first in sin his doom applied Though in mysterious terms judged as then best And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall

 There stood A grove hard by sprung up with this their change His will who reigns above to aggravate Their penance laden with fair fruit like that Which grew in Paradise the bait of Eve Used by the Tempter on that prospect strange Their earnest eyes they fixed imagining For one forbidden tree a multitude Now risen to work them further woe or shame Yet parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce Though to delude them sent could not abstain But on they rolled in heaps and up the trees Climbing sat thicker than the snaky locks That curled Megaera greedily they plucked The fruitage fair to sight like that which grew Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed This more delusive not the touch but taste Deceived they fondly thinking to allay Their appetite with gust instead of fruit Chewed bitter ashes which the offended taste With spattering noise rejected oft they assayed Hunger and thirst constraining drugged as oft With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws With soot and cinders filled so oft they fell Into the same illusion not as Man Whom they triumphed once lapsed

 Yet one doubt Pursues me still lest all I cannot die Lest that pure breath of life the spirit of Man Which God inspired cannot together perish With this corporeal clod then in the grave Or in some other dismal place who knows But I shall die a living death O thought Horrid if true Yet why It was but breath Of life that sinned what dies but what had life And sin The body properly had neither All of me then shall die let this appease The doubt since human reach no further knows

 Remember with what mild And gracious temper he both heard and judged Without wrath or reviling we expected Immediate dissolution which we thought Was meant by death that day when lo to thee Pains only in child bearing were foretold And bringing forth soon recompensed with joy Fruit of thy womb On me the curse aslope Glanced on the ground with labour I must earn My bread what harm Idleness had been worse My labour will sustain me and lest cold Or heat should injure us his timely care Hath unbesought provided and his hands Clothed us unworthy pitying while he judged How much more if we pray him will his ear Be open and his heart to pity incline And teach us further by what means to shun The inclement seasons rain ice hail and snow Which now the sky with various face begins To show us in this mountain while the winds Blow moist and keen shattering the graceful locks Of these fair spreading trees which bids us seek Some better shroud some better warmth to cherish Our limbs benummed ere this diurnal star Leave cold the night how we his gathered beams Reflected may with matter sere foment Or by collision of two bodies grind The air attrite to fire as late the clouds Justling or pushed with winds rude in their shock Tine the slant lightning whose thwart flame driven down Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine And sends a comfortable heat from far Which might supply the sun Such fire to use And what may else be remedy or cure To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought He will instruct us praying and of grace Beseeching him so as we need not fear To pass commodiously this life sustained By him with many comforts till we end In dust our final rest and native home

 O Eve some further change awaits us nigh Which Heaven by these mute signs in Nature shows Forerunners of his purpose or to warn Us haply too secure of our discharge From penalty because from death released Some days how long and what till then our life Who knows or more than this that we are dust And thither must return and be no more Why else this double object in our sight Of flight pursued in the air and o er the ground One way the self same hour why in the east Darkness ere day s mid course and morning light More orient in yon western cloud that draws O er the blue firmament a radiant white And slow descends with something heavenly fraught He erred not for by this the heavenly bands Down from a sky of jasper lighted now In Paradise and on a hill made halt A glorious apparition had not doubt And carnal fear that day dimmed Adam s eye

 And now what further shall ensue behold

 This further consolation yet secure I carry hence though all by me is lost Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed By me the Promised Seed shall all restore

 If they had dwelt here from their creation why had they not progressed further in civilization and if they emigrated hither from another continent why do their remains not indicate their source By what agency did they perish and when The more keenly we strive to penetrate their mystery the more perplexing does it appear the further we investigate them the more alien from anything we are or have known do they seem

 To avoid any further disturbance one of my grandfather s executors who was present assured Mr

 The highwayman not being so well mounted as the two servants who went in pursuit of him was soon overtaken and after having discharged his pistols made prisoner without any further opposition

 This event was a great disappointment to those that apprehended him who were flushed with the hopes of the reward but gave me great joy as I was permitted now to continue my journey without any further molestation

 When this affair was discussed everybody retired to his own apartment the sergeant slipped into bed and my companion and I slept without any further disturbance till morning when we got up went to breakfast paid our reckoning and set forward in expectation of overtaking the waggon in which hope however we were disappointed for that day

 The menace had like to have produced fatal consequences the three strangers drawing their swords and being joined by their servants and we ranging ourselves on the side of Joey when the landlord interposing offered to part with his own dinner to keep the peace which was accepted by the strangers and we sat down at table without any further molestation

 By this time the horseman came up and happened to be a gentleman s servant well known to Joey who communicated the scheme and desired him to carry it on a little further by going into the waggon and questioning those within

 Having transacted this piece of business my mind was a good deal composed and as I had met with so much civility from the stranger I desired further acquaintance with him fully resolved however not to be deceived by him so much to my prejudice as I had been by the beau

 This frankness not only cured me of my suspicion with respect to her but even staggered my belief with regard to the captain of whose guilt I resolved to have further proof before I should enterprise anything in the way of revenge

 Hero she called to them and desired they would let the wretch go and trouble themselves no further about him

 Next morning after breakfast he took his leave when my father begged the favour of further acquaintance with him to which request he replied by a compliment to him and a look to me so full of eloquence and tenderness that my whole soul received the soft impression

 It may be so answered he but I ll have further evidence that you are not the person before you and I part

 Yes yes said she you shall have further evidence to your cost

 In the morning my attempt was published among the prisoners and punished with thirty stripes the pain of which co operating with my disappointment and disgrace bereft me of my senses and threw me into an ecstacy of madness during which I tore the flesh from my bones with my teeth and dashed my head against the pavement so that they were obliged to set a watch over me to restrain me from doing further mischief to myself and others

 As we often conferred upon our mutual affairs and interchanged advice a thousand different projects were formed which upon further canvassing appeared impracticable

 Morgan his pride displeasure and generosity the economy of our mess described Thomson s further friendship the nature of my duty explained the situation of the sick While he was thus discoursing to me we heard a voice on the cockpit ladder pronounce with great vehemence in a strange dialect The devil and his dam blow me from the top of Monchdenny if I go to him before there is something in my pelly

 I acknowledged his kindness in the strongest terms my gratitude could suggest and professed my sorrow at the prospect of losing so valuable a friend to whom I hoped to have recommended myself still further by my respectful and diligent behaviour

 Having nothing further to urge in my own behalf before a court so prejudiced with spite and fortified with ignorance against truth I suffered myself to be reconducted peaceably to my fellow prisoner who hearing the particulars of my trial lifted up his hands and eyes to Heaven and uttered a dreadful groan and not daring to disburden his thoughts to me by speech lest he might be overheard by the sentinel burst forth into a Welsh song which he accompanied with a thousand contortions of face and violent gestures of body

 With this view he repaired to the cabin in his ordinary dress consisting of a check shirt and trousers a brown linen waistcoat and a nightcap of the same neither of them very clean which for his further misfortune happened to smell strong of tobacco

 We were thunderstruck at this proposal and stared at one another some time without speaking at length the Welshman broke silence and offered to remain in the West Indies provided the admiral would give him a surgeon s warrant immediately but he was told there was no want of chief surgeons and that he must be contented with the station of mate till he should be further provided for in due course

 To prevent this calamity as soon as I was untied in consequence of the aforesaid decision I tore a small hole in one of my stockings into which I dropped six guineas reserving half a piece and some silver in my pocket that finding something they might not be tempted to make any further inquiry

 But I was too much concerned in the affair to neglect further information and therefore took the first opportunity of asking the porter if he knew the gentleman to whom the marquis spoke

 That my declaration might have the better effect I took notice of his deshabille and professing sorrow at seeing a gentleman reduced slipped two guineas into his hand at sight of which he threw away his pistols and hugging me in his arms cried Arrah by Jasus now you are the best friend I have met with these seven long years When I had suffered some minutes in his embrace he quitted me and picking up his rusty arms wished the devil might burn him if ever he should give me any further trouble about womankind

 As a further proof of his veracity which I did not at all doubt he opened an old iron snuff box and pulled out his commission in the Imperial army and his captain s challenge which he preserved as testimonials of his character

 Upon further inquiry I found this person s name was Miss Biddy Gripewell that her father who had been a pawnbroker died intestate by which means all his substance descended to his daughter who was so little a favourite that could the old man have prevailed with his own rapacious disposition to part with as much money as would have paid the expense of a will she would not have inherited the sixth part of his fortune that during his life far from being educated in a way suitable to such great expectations she was obliged to live like a servant wench and do the most menial offices in the family

 The lacquey made the same reply and disappeared before I could get any further intelligence

 On the other hand I assured his lordship that I should look upon it as an uncommon mark of distinction if he would take it without further question and rather than disoblige me he was at last persuaded to put it in his pocket to my no small satisfaction who took my leave immediately after having received a kind squeeze and an injunction to depend upon his promise

 Convinced by this time of the fairness of the game and animated with success there was no need of further persuasion to continue the play I lent Banter who seldom had any money in his pocket a guinea which he carried to the gold table and lost in a moment

 This person of honour did not think fit to carry on the altercation any further but seemed to chew the cud of her resentment with the crestfallen captain while I entered into discourse with my charmer who was the more pleased with my conversation as she had conceived a very indifferent opinion of my intellects from my former silence

 But when I began to consider that without further opportunities of improving my success all the progress I had hitherto made would not much avail and that such opportunities could not be enjoyed without the mother s permission I concluded it would be requisite to vanquish her coldness and suspicion by my assiduities and respectful behaviour on the road and she would in all likelihood invite me to visit her at Bath where I did not fear of being able to cultivate her acquaintance as much as would be necessary to the accomplishment of my purpose

 Nash who commonly attends in this place as master of the ceremonies perceiving the disposition of the assembly took upon himself the task of gratifying their ill nature further by exposing my mistress to the edge of his wit

 This event with which I was indefinitely pleased at first did not fail of alarming me upon further reflection when I considered that the more she was caressed by persons of distinction the more her pride would be inflamed and consequently the obstacles to my success multiplied and enlarged

 Dinner was scarcely ended when the squire became very drowsy and after several dreadful yawns got up stretched himself took two or three turns across the room begged we would allow him to take a short nap and having laid a strong injunction on his sister to detain us till his return went to his repose without further ceremony

 I thought this piece of intelligence which I had myself invented would have hindered him effectually from entertaining any further thoughts of her but I was egregiously mistaken

 I was thunderstruck with this intelligence the light forsook my eyes the colour vanished from my cheeks and I remained in a state of universal trepidation My female friend perceiving my disorder encouraged me with assurances of Narcissa s constancy and the hope of some accident favourable to our love and as a further consolation gave me to understand that she had acquainted my mistress with the outlines of my life and that although she was no stranger to the present low state of my finances her love and esteem were rather increased than diminished by the knowledge of my circumstances

 I was met at the door by a servant who presented a billet to me without a subscription importing that my presence was disagreeable to the company and desiring I would take the hint without further disturbance and bestow myself elsewhere for the future

 As I walked homeward in hope of hearing from my mistress as usual by means of Miss Williams I was surprised with the waving of a handkerchief from the window of a coach and six that passed by me at full speed and upon further observation I saw a servant on horseback riding after it who I knew by his livery belonged to the squire

 When I desired him to explain his meaning he pointed to his neck raised himself on his tiptoes and was going away without any further ceremony when I put him in mind of my indigence and demanded the five guineas I had formerly lent him

 Without explaining myself any further I told him be was mistaken in his conjecture that I had been for some time past with the relation of whom he had frequently heard me speak and that as I should set out next day upon my travels I had come to take my leave of my friends and to receive of him the money he had borrowed from me which now that I was going abroad I should certainly have occasion for

 Among those who signalised themselves by their civility to us was one Don Antonio de Ribera a very polite young gentleman with whom I had contracted an intimate friendship who invited us one day to his country house and as a further inducement to our compliance promised to procure for us the company of an English Signor who had been settled in those parts many years

 Next morning while we were at breakfast three mules richly caparisoned arrived with a message from Don Rodrigo desiring our company and that of Don Antonio at his house which was situated about ten miles further up in the country

 When we had rowed a little further we discerned it to be a man riding upon a hencoop who seeing us approach pronounced with a hoarse voice D n your bloods why did you not answer when I hailed Our mate who was a veritable seaman hearing his salute said By G my lads this is none of our man

 It was determined that he should write to the squire signifying his approbation of my passion for his sister and offering a settlement which he should have no reason to reject and that if he should refuse the proposal we would crown our mutual wishes without any further regard to his will

 CHAPTER XXIV On that bright evening of August Prince Andrew lay leaning on his elbow in a broken down shed in the village of Knyazkovo at the further end of his regiment s encampment

 Prince Andrew rose hastily listened to the business they had come about gave them some further instructions and was about to dismiss them when he heard a familiar lisping voice behind the shed

 It was impossible to give further orders for the sake of killing time for the orders had all been given and were now being executed

 Without further thought as to who had taken whom prisoner the Frenchman ran back to the battery and Pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who it seemed to him caught at his feet

 But he needed further proofs and it was necessary to wait

 BOOK FOURTEEN CHAPTER I The Battle of Borodino with the occupation of Moscow that followed it and the flight of the French without further conflicts is one of the most instructive phenomena in history

 Monsieur de Morcerf replied the count your offer far from surprising me is precisely what I expected from you and I accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made nay I will go still further and say that I had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands

 Very well and Monte Cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary which said I have no further need of you you may go

 Thanks thanks said Monte Cristo judging from the steward s utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of breaking it

 I looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreaty

 Debray I need not give a further description because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known

 Where am I exclaimed she and to whom am I indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm Madame answered the count you are under the roof of one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings

 Madame de Villefort made no further reply her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who from the first instant she saw him had made so powerful an impression on her

 There are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity and I will say further the art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance

 And further that he stated to M

 I am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone replied Morcerf but I am reluctantly obliged to confess I have nothing further to communicate yes stay I do know one thing more namely that she is a musician for one day when I chanced to be breakfasting with the count I heard the sound of a guzla it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own

 In order to save Major Cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker I send him a draft for francs to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of francs which you still owe me

 Have you never experienced for any one that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend though in reality it was the first time you had ever met Nay further have you never endeavored to recall the time place and circumstances of your former intercourse and failing in this attempt have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past Yes

 Well Valentine said Morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter further

 Certainly said Danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land

 As for you although we doctors cannot divest our patients of nerves I fancy you have no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field

 If we were surprised if it were known that we met thus we should have no further resource

 Then said Villefort nothing further is required

 One paragraph spoke of the return of Bonaparte and promised another letter and further details on the arrival of the Pharaon belonging to the shipbuilder Morrel of Marseilles whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor

 Well then before going to Beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the subject

 Some further discovery will be made which will bring this dreadful tragedy to a close

 Ali looked at his master for further instructions

 Shall further inquiries be made Shall two members of the House be sent to Yanina Speak Morcerf did not reply

 D Avrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away and Villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man

 Do you wish for any further details I will give them

 Noirtier s room he perceived two figures through the half open door but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father anxiety carried him on further

 Now if the Council has said Carpenter or Cook the Students so assigned go to work work and they do not study any further

 The oldest did not question us further

 Through the years ahead I shall rebuild the achievements of the past and open the way to carry them further the achievements which are open to me but closed forever to my brothers for their minds are shackled to the weakest and dullest ones among them

 On the st of January the Wednesday of the present week the German Ambassador handed to the Secretary of State along with a formal note a memorandum which contains the following statement GERMANY S NEW POLICY The Imperial Government therefore does not doubt that the Government of the United States will understand the situation thus forced upon Germany by the Entente Allies brutal methods of war and by their determination to destroy the Central Powers and that the Government of the United States will further realize that the now openly disclosed intentions of the Entente Allies give back to Germany the freedom of action which she reserved in her note addressed to the Government of the United States on May

 Then the captain turned to me and said Hark ee thou art a stranger and a pauper and tellest us that thou hast undergone frightful hardship wherefore I have a mind to benefit thee with somewhat that may further thee to thy native land so thou wilt ever bless me and pray for me

 However I followed it to the further end till I saw afar off a point of light not bigger than a star now appearing and then disappearing

 Do as they do and belike thou shalt gain what may further thy return voyage to thy native land

 It seemed upon further inquiry that there was little reason to anticipate an early death for anyone of ourselves and this being so we rather liked the idea of someone else s being put away into the churchyard we passed therefore in a short time from extreme depression to a no less extreme exultation a new heaven and a new earth had been revealed to us in our perception of the possibility of benefiting by the death of our friends and I fear that for some time we took an interest in the health of everyone in the village whose position rendered a repetition of the dole in the least likely

 God may yet give me the spirit for which I assure you I have been and am continually praying but He may not and in that case would it not be better for me to try and look out for something else I know that neither you nor John wish me to go into your business nor do I understand anything about money matters but is there nothing else that I can do I do not like to ask you to maintain me while I go in for medicine or the bar but when I get my fellowship which should not be long first I will endeavour to cost you nothing further and I might make a little money by writing or taking pupils

 I trust you will not think this letter improper nothing is further from my wish than to cause you any uneasiness

 It is quite right and natural that you should feel as you do except as regards one passage the impropriety of which you will yourself doubtless feel upon reflection and to which I will not further allude than to say that it has wounded me

 I knew you would not press ordination upon me if my conscience was seriously opposed to it I have therefore resolved on giving up the idea and believe that if you will continue to allow me what you do at present until I get my fellowship which should not be long I will then cease putting you to further expense

 I have thus started you fairly in life and may claim that you should cease to be a drag upon me further

 The moon had risen and the arbour was getting damp so they adjourned further aspirations for a more convenient season

 After a few minutes further reflection he broached the matter to his bride and thus the ice was broken

 Then he puts a stop to the conversation by repeating prayers taken from the Visitation of the Sick and overawes the poor wretch from expressing further anxiety as to her condition

 His hair when he was a young man was red but after he had taken his degree he had a brain fever which caused him to have his head shaved when he reappeared he did so wearing a wig and one which was a good deal further off red than his own hair had been

 After he had had the breath knocked out of him and been well shinned half a dozen times in scrimmages at football scrimmages in which he had become involved sorely against his will he ceased to see any further fun in football and shirked that noble game in a way that got him into trouble with the elder boys who would stand no shirking on the part of the younger ones

 If she recovered we could see things put on a more satisfactory footing and further discussion would evidently impair her chances of recovery it seemed then only too likely that it was a case of this will or no will at all

 I do not think they had even made up their minds what Alethea was to do with her money before they knew of her being at the point of death and as I have said already if they had thought it likely that Ernest would be made heir over their own heads without their having at any rate a life interest in the bequest they would have soon thrown obstacles in the way of further intimacy between aunt and nephew

 Ernest was much distressed for he liked the cook and of course wanted to know what all the matter was who it was that had just gone off in the pony carriage and why The cook told him it was Ellen but said that no earthly power should make it cross her lips why it was she was going away when however Ernest took her au pied de la lettre and asked no further questions she told him all about it after extorting the most solemn promises of secrecy

 Ernest through sheer force of habit of the sofa and of the return of the associated ideas was still so moved by the siren s voice as to yearn to sail towards her and fling himself into her arms but it would not do there were other associated ideas that returned also and the mangled bones of too many murdered confessions were lying whitening round the skirts of his mother s dress to allow him by any possibility to trust her further

 He told me further that thinking the circumstances in which the watch was offered for sale somewhat suspicious he had insisted upon the woman s telling him the whole story of how she came by it before he would consent to buy it of her

 He did not believe it indeed he knew very well that if they thought him clever they were being taken in but it pleased him to have been able to take them in and he tried to do so still further he was therefore a good deal on the look out for cants that he could catch and apply in season and might have done himself some mischief thus if he had not been ready to throw over any cant as soon as he had come across another more nearly to his fancy his friends used to say that when he rose he flew like a snipe darting several times in various directions before he settled down to a steady straight flight but when he had once got into this he would keep to it

 He did not understand that if he waited and listened and observed another idea of some kind would probably occur to him some day and that the development of this would in its turn suggest still further ones

 And now let me go further

 Towneley took this for what it was worth and nodded assent whereon Ernest imprudently went further and said Don t you like poor people very much yourself Towneley gave his face a comical but good natured screw and said quietly but slowly and decidedly No no no and escaped

 Ernest thought that further questions would look as if he doubted Pryer s word and also that he had gone too far to be able to recede in decency or honour

 The more he read in this spirit the more the balance seemed to lie in favour of unbelief till in the end all further doubt became impossible and he saw plainly enough that whatever else might be true the story that Christ had died come to life again and been carried from earth through clouds into the heavens could not now be accepted by unbiassed people

 Nor again can he get further than telling a man he is a fool if he persists in differing from him

 He says which is absurd and declines to discuss the matter further

 He knew his father and mother would object to being cut they would wish to appear kind and forgiving they would also dislike having no further power to plague him but he knew also very well that so long as he and they ran in harness together they would be always pulling one way and he another

 As he thought further he remembered that all things work together for good to them that love God was it possible he asked himself that he too however imperfectly had been trying to love him He dared not answer Yes but he would try hard that it should be so

 Ernest could hardly believe his ears but when the doctor had seen his wife and she had become more quiet he went over to the public house hard by and made enquiries the result of which rendered further doubt impossible

 She knew that he was on the watch to shield her from temptation and though he did his best to make her think that he had no further uneasiness about her she found the burden of her union with respectability grow more and more heavy upon her and looked back more and more longingly upon the lawless freedom of the life she had led before she met her husband

 The wear and tear of the last three years had told on him and though not actually ill he was over worked below par and unfit for any further burden

 And I thought Ernest to himself again when the arrangement was concluded am the man who thought himself unlucky I may as well say here all that need be said further about Ellen

 Large as his property now was it ought to be increased still further during the year and a half that remained of his minority so that on coming of age he ought to have an income of at least pounds a year

 Of course no further questioning was possible

 My hero thought over these things and remembered many a ruse on the part of Christina and Charlotte and many a detail of the struggle which I cannot further interrupt my story to refer to and he remembered his father s favourite retort that it could only end in Rome

 Sometimes like all whose minds are active Ernest overworks himself and then occasionally he has fierce and reproachful encounters with Dr Skinner or Theobald in his sleep but beyond this neither of these two worthies can now molest him further

 The figures are in profile except that the king s further shoulder is thrown forward in much the fashion which we have found the rule in Egypt and the eyes appear as in front view

 It will be seen that the roof has been formed by pushing the successive courses of stones further and further inward from both sides until they meet

 Its wall is formed of horizontal courses of stone each pushed further inward than the one below it until the opening was small enough to be covered by a single stone

 A further difference should be noted

 In the present instance there may be the further desire to suggest by the greater size of the seated figures their greater dignity as goddesses or divinized human beings

 Further the two figures should probably be advancing in the same direction instead of in converging lines

 who argues further that the statue as thus restored is a faithful copy of the Lemnian Athena of Phidias a bronze work which stood on the Athenian Acropolis

 These artists seem to be emerging a little from the darkness that has enveloped them and it may be hoped that discoveries of new material and further study of already existing material will reveal them to us with some degree of clearness and certainty

 Swollen ears were the conventional mark of the boxer at all periods but here the effect is still further enhanced by scratches and drops of blood

 To prevent further mischief the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni took up tho body and found it as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism fresh and entirely free from corruption and emitting at the mouth nose and ears pure and florid blood

 Whilst turning them over and examining their curious forms what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut he shuddered hastening to gain further proof he found the weapon and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted though peculiarly shaped the sheath he held in his hand

 His eyes seemed to need no further certainty they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger yet still he wished to disbelieve but the particular form the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both and left no room for doubt there were also drops of blood on each

 Rather a large estate thought the girl but now her interest was still further aroused

 Could any one thing have further bound Jane Porter to her promise to Clayton it would have been in the nature of some such misfortune as this overtaking him

 The only thing about her that he had particularly noticed was a ring of peculiar workmanship upon a finger of the hand that Rokoff had seized and he determined to note the fingers of the women passengers he came upon thereafter that he might discover the identity of her whom Rokoff was persecuting and learn if the fellow had offered her further annoyance

 Further there was something rather familiar about her that set Tarzan to wondering where he had seen her before

 I would not care to have the matter go further please monsieur and there was such a note of pleading in her voice that Tarzan could not press the matter though his better judgment warned him that there was something afoot here of which the proper authorities should be made cognizant

 And you madame will confer a great favor upon me if you will but let me know if either of those rascals troubles you further

 Tarzan saw nothing further of any of the actors in the little drama that he had caught a fleeting glimpse of until late in the afternoon of the last day of the voyage

 Alas monsieur I already am so greatly indebted to you that I may never hope to settle my own account so pray do not add further to my obligations and she smiled so sweetly upon him that Tarzan felt that a man might easily attempt much greater things than he had accomplished solely for the pleasure of receiving the benediction of that smile

 Further conversation was interrupted by the appearance of the four policemen

 Have they annoyed you further They never cease she replied sadly

 On the morrow he was to return for further instructions though General Rochere had made it quite plain that Tarzan might prepare to leave Paris for an almost indefinite period possibly on the morrow

 As Tarzan was dickering at Bouira for a mount he caught a brief glimpse of a man in European clothes eying him from the doorway of a native coffeehouse but as Tarzan looked the man turned and entered the little low ceilinged mud hut and but for a haunting impression that there had been something familiar about the face or figure of the fellow Tarzan gave the matter no further thought

 This was the first suspicious occurrence that Tarzan had ever witnessed in connection with Gernois actions but he was positive that the men had left the barroom solely because Gernois had caught Tarzan s eyes upon them then there was the persistent impression of familiarity about the stranger to further augment the ape man s belief that here at length was something which would bear watching

 Without further mishap they reached the hotel

 He did not try to explain further for it always seemed to him that a woman must look with loathing upon one who was yet so nearly a beast

 His further instructions would be awaiting him there in the hands of another agent whose name and address were given

 The moment I am reported dead by assassination that dear Alexis will forward to the minister of war full proof of the affair you so ardently long to conceal and further will charge you with my murder

 Just one more little payment continued Rokoff and the papers I wish and you have my word of honor that I shall never ask another cent from you or further information

 She was glad for she hoped that whatever called him to England might still further delay the wedding

 And he is dead Oh Hazel it is horrible He died all alone in this terrible ocean It is unbelievable that that brave heart should have ceased to beat that those mighty muscles are quiet and cold forever That he who was the personification of life and health and manly strength should be the prey of slimy crawling things that But she could go no further and with a little moan she buried her head in her arms and sank sobbing to the floor

 When he finally walked away from them toward the side of the village opposite the gate they were still further mystified as to his intentions

 Tarzan had wished that he might have taken some of the great store of ivory the village contained solely for the purpose of still further augmenting the wrath of his enemies but he knew that that was not necessary for its salvation since he already had a plan mapped out which would effectually prevent the Arabs leaving the country with a single tusk

 After a time they commenced to quiet down and as no further mysterious deaths occurred among them they took heart again

 For a time no one turned back toward the thing that had frightened them but Tarzan knew that they would in a moment and when they discovered that it was but the dead body of their sentry while they would doubtless be still further terrified he had a rather definite idea as to what they would do and so he faded silently away toward the south taking the moonlit upper terrace back toward the camp of the Waziri

 It took all the mastery and persuasion that Tarzan possessed to prevent the Waziri falling on the Manyuema tooth and nail and tearing them to pieces but when he had explained that he had given his word that they would not be molested if they carried the ivory back to the spot from which they had stolen it and had further impressed upon his people that they owed their entire victory to him they finally acceded to his demands and allowed the cannibals to rest in peace within their palisade

 And then quite unexpectedly that occurred which decided the question without the necessity for further discussion

 And had he needed further assurance as to the correctness of his theory he had only to cast his eyes upon the brownish red stains that caked the stone altar and covered the floor in its immediate vicinity or to the human skulls which grinned from countless niches in the towering walls

 If he lives and this rain revives him But he stopped there remembering too late that he must not add further to the horrors which the girl already had endured

 Still further invigorated by the food Clayton had brought the three were able to reach the half shade of the small tree to which their boat was moored

 There was something in her tone of voice that led the Russian to attribute to her a deeper feeling for his enemy than friendship and he grasped at the suggestion to be further revenged upon the man whom he supposed dead by besmirching his memory to the girl

 The last few seconds of my life have taught me that it would be hideous to attempt further to deceive myself and you or to entertain for an instant longer the possibility of ever becoming your wife should we regain civilization

 Along the tops of the bars were deep layers of dust a further indication that the passage had lain long unused

 The majority of the apes went on about the little activities that the advent of the ape man had interrupted paying no further attention to him than as though he had not been gone from the tribe at all

 Just then further conversation was interrupted by the sight of a strange and terrible looking figure which emerged from the jungle just south of the camp

 During the grotesque dance of the votaries which followed she lay frozen in horror nor did she require the sight of the thin blade in the hands of the high priestess as it rose slowly above her to enlighten her further as to her doom

 But when the men of Opar had talked further about the matter they recalled to mind that this very man had escaped once before into the pits and though they had watched the entrance he had not come forth and yet today he had come upon them from the outside

 Whether it was because they recalled the futility of their former long and irksome search or after witnessing the ease with which the ape man swung along before them and the last burst of speed they realized the utter hopelessness of further pursuit it is difficult to say but as Tarzan reached the woods that began at the base of the foothills which skirted the barrier cliffs they turned their faces once more toward Opar

 This is all the advantage you have drawn from New York and you would draw less from Philadelphia because it requires more force to keep it and is much further from the sea

 I have been civil in stating this fault on a large scale for as it now stands it does not appear to be levelled against any particular set of men but were it to be refined a little further it might afterwards be applied to the Tories with a degree of striking propriety those men have been remarkable for drawing sudden conclusions from single facts

 You have yet scarce began upon the war and the further you enter the faster will your troubles thicken

 I do not propose this as a regular digested plan neither will the limits of this paper admit of any further remarks upon it

 There are as effectual limits to public debts as to private ones for when once the money borrowed is so great as to require the whole yearly revenue to discharge the interest thereon there is an end to further borrowing in the same manner as when the interest of a man s debts amounts to the yearly income of his estate there is an end to his credit

 She is not now in a fit disposition to make a common cause of her own affairs and having no conquests to hope for abroad and nothing but expenses arising at home her everything is staked upon a defensive combat and the further she goes the worse she is off

 My intention by these arguments and calculations is to place the difficulty to the right cause and show that it does not proceed from the weight or worth of the tax but from the scarcity of the medium in which it is paid and to illustrate this point still further I shall now show that if the tax of twenty millions of dollars was of four times the real value it now is or nearly so which would be about two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling and would be our full quota this sum would have been raised with more ease and have been less felt than the present sum of only sixty four thousand two hundred and eighty pounds

 My limits will not allow me to go further into this matter which I shall therefore close with this remark that fines are of all modes of revenue the most unsuited to the minds of a free country

 There appeared about that time some disposition in the British cabinet to cease the further prosecution of the war and as I had formed my opinion that whenever such a design should take place it would be accompanied by a dishonorable proposition to America respecting France I had suppressed the remainder of that number not to expose the baseness of any such proposition

 But I will go still further General Conway who made the motion in the British Parliament for discontinuing offensive war in America is a gentleman of an amiable character

 Some offences are of such a slight composition that they reach no further than the temper and are created or cured by a thought

 There is no new scene left for delusion and the thousands who have been ruined by adhering to them and have now to quit the settlements which they had acquired and be conveyed like transports to cultivate the deserts of Augustine and Nova Scotia has put an end to all further expectations of aid

 As for him he at once understood the matter and ceased to send forth further lamentation

 Now notice will have been given to the police on the further bank and if we re not drowned we shall find ourselves clapped in gaol when we get there

 In very truth is he a man and no mistake Just look at him The closer we approached the further shore the thinner and the more brittle did the ice become and the more liable we to break through it

 What do you say you the sergeant began but his bluster was lost amid the swift flow of Ossip s further conciliatory words

 We are folk of this town Ossip continued who tonight found ourselves stranded on the further bank with nothing to buy bread with even though the day after tomorrow will be Christ s day the day when Christians like ourselves wish to clean themselves up a little and to go to church

 Mice squeaked under the floor and on the further side of the Oka an owl screeched while amid the pitch black heavens I could see a number of blotches intermittently lightening to an elusive red and blurring the faint glitter of the stars

 Yet still asleep amid its sheltering half circle of forest was the quiet little town of Miamlin while behind it and encompassing it as with a pair of dark wings the forest in question looked as though it were ruffling its feathers in preparation for further flight beyond the point where the peaceful Oka reached the trees stood darkening overshadowing the water s clear depths and looking at themselves therein

 And in contemplating the spectacle I seemed actually to be able to hear the cruel hissing din of combat between red and black and to see pale frightened rabbits scudding from underneath the roots of trees amid showers of sparks and panting half suffocated birds fluttering wildly amid the branches as further and further afield and more and more triumphantly the scarlet dragon unfurled its wings and consumed the darkness and devoured the rain soaked timber

 To this after a pause the speaker added Now depart in peace and make no further attempt against this woman

 Upon that he inflated his cheeks ruffled up his sandy hair turned red in the face like a man who has been through a fight and cried in strange querulous high pitched accents Hi What were you doing just now Long legged devil that you are I have no further use for you I do not intend to work with you any more

 Further on the ravine trends across the plain then bends round towards the western side of the town cats away the clayey soil with an appetite which each spring increases and which carrying the soil down to the river is gradually clogging the river s flow diverting the muddy water towards the marshes and converting those marshes into a lagoon outright

 This led to the putting of a further dozen or so of leading questions whereafter Antipa for a while preserved a suggestive silence and the crowd too remained silent as though it had suddenly been lulled to slumber

 Further pointing to a grey headstone with a worn inscription he shouted or almost did so Under that stone lies buried the body of a man who never in his life loved but one woman but ONE woman

 Next there scaled the cemetery wall and stealthily stretched themselves on the ground so that they looked not unlike the far flung shadows of the cemetery s crosses a file of dark tattered figures of beggars while on the further side of the slowly darkening greenery a cantor drawled in sluggish careless accents E e ternal me e Eternal memory of what exclaimed Lieutenant Khorvat with an angry shrug of his shoulders

 Gradually also the shadows were deepening and lengthening while on the further side of the cemetery wall a cow lowed at intervals in a gross and drunken fashion and a party of fowls cackled what seemed to be curses in response and a saw grated and screeched

 In endless vista were meadows studded with trees trees sleeping in lonely isolation and in places surmounted with either the cross of a rural church which looked like a day star or the sails of a windmill while further back from the banks lay the tissue cloths of ripening crops with here and there a human habitation

 Yet already had the heavens begun to grow coldly grey to lose their nocturnal softness and warmth while the rays of the stars were drooping like petals and the moon hitherto golden had turned pale and become dusted over with silver and moved further from the earth as intangibly the water of the river sloughed its thick viscous gleam and swiftly emitted and withdrew stray pearly reflections of the changes occurring in the heavenly tints

 It is he mutters as he thrusts his head a little further through the grating

 Also move further from the wall

 Then with a further glance at me and a twist of his sinewy neck he added However not bad altogether are its forests

 Personally however I had no desire to converse with him for his frozen eyes chilled and repelled me and from the moment when I had approached him and seen him fold his hands behind him and recoil a step as he inquired with suppressed sternness What do you want there had fallen away from me all further ambition to learn the nature of the songs which he sang

 The trouble with me he remarked in an undertone is that I can never remain very long in one place always I keep fancying that I shall meet with better things elsewhere always I keep hearing a bird singing in my heart Do you go further do you go further

 But this place is further still Further still Yes from Kursk

 Slowly the torch holder described a circle of fire in the air and thereby sprinkled a further shower of sparks over the poor mutilated face with its streaks of shining blood

 Over the sea the clouds were hurrying towards the land as ever and anon they rent themselves into strips and revealed fathomless abysses of blue wherein the autumn sun burned uneasily and sent cloud shadows gliding over the puckered waste of waters until the shore reached the wind further harried the masses of vapour towards the sharp flanks of the mountains and after drawing them up and down the slopes relegated them to clefts and left them steaming there

 Here a pilgrim with a black beard a brigand s dark eyes and the wasted features of an ascetic rose from the further side of the table straightened his virile frame and said in a dull voice My wife and one of my children were burnt to death through the falling of an oil lamp

 As I contemplate all this beauty and inhale this restfulness I find myself reflecting How would it be if I were to let everything go to the devil and take up my abode here for ever At this point all further speech became drowned by the sound of the monastery s bell as it struck the hour

 I nodded nothing else could I compass for further speech had become impossible

 Whereafter further withdrawing his spare frame under the stone so that he might stretch himself at full length Kalinin continued I walked to the pantry quietly enough though my legs were tottering beneath me and I had a cold sensation in my breast

 In the vague wide firmament a blood red cluster of clouds was hanging and as I contemplated it there occurred to me the thought May not those clouds be erstwhile righteous world folk who are following an unseen path across that expanse and dyeing it red with their good blood as they go in order that the earth may be fertilised To right and left of that strip of living flame the sea was of a curious wine tint while further off rather it was as soft and black as velvet and in the remote east sheet lightning was flashing even as though some giant hand were fruitlessly endeavouring to strike a match against the sodden firmament

 And then I pressed him further Kalinin added

 On the further side of the rivulet some seven white huts lay pressed against a small declivity that was crowned with a cattle fold and amid the silver grey trunks of some tall black poplars whose shadows where they fell upon the hamlet seemed as soft as down a knee haltered horse was stumping with swishing tail

 On the further bank of the latter a goose was strutting importantly at the head of a string of round fluffy yellow goslings whilst driving the brood were two little girls the one a child but little larger than the goose itself dressed in a red frock and armed with a switch and the other one a youngster absolutely of a size with the bird pale of feature plump of body bowed of leg and grave of expression

 En route we heard once more a strident shout of Ufi i im As we proceeded shadows of trees glided along the soft road to meet us while behind a clump of bushes on the further bank of the rivulet some children were shouting at their play

 After that the company held further converse in whispers

 With which he buzzed into my ear To whom shall I sing of my grief To whom resort for relief To the One in whose ha a and At this point the sharp bristles of his beard so tickled my neck as to cause me to edge further away

 And ever as the being receded further and further into the distance could I see him sowing with tireless hands that which had in it life and was part of himself and human as with thoughts intent upon the benefiting of humanity he summoned all men to put forth the mysterious force that is in them and thus to conquer death and eternally and invincibly to convert dead things into things of life while traversing in company the road of death towards that which has no knowledge of death and ensuring that in swallowing up mankind the jaws of death should not close upon death s victims

 As a result of further meditations however she turned aside from the direct route and entered a post office

 Would the mere fact of his having been admitted to the house be sufficient Perhaps a further password would be required or at any rate some proof of identity

 She felt and rightly that before the strain of attempting further intercourse with Albert it would be as well to fortify herself with a good supply of local colour

 Fighting down that instinct of panic which urged her to turn tail and run without further delay Tuppence returned the lady s gaze firmly and respectfully

 You did not mention his name this afternoon or I would have suggested your going to him for further information with my card as introduction

 You must let me know if anything further comes to light

 The telegram was from Tommy CHAPTER XVI FURTHER ADVENTURES OF TOMMY FROM a darkness punctuated with throbbing stabs of fire Tommy dragged his senses slowly back to life

 If the operations are complicated he will return to you with a report and you can instruct him further

 Further meditations induced in him the feeling that it would be extremely pleasant to bring something down with a whack on Conrad s egg shaped head

 The terrific pace they had come had still further unmanned him

 With these proofs of conspiracy in their hands aided further by a small brown diary taken from the pocket of the dead man which had contained a full and damning resume of the whole plot the Government had called an eleventh hour conference

 I thought it would further my plans

 With the genuine information thus received he intersperses under the name of Additions further details which had either come under his personal observation or been gleaned from perfectly reliable sources

 But although they struggled through the trying winter and spring it was but too evident that without relief they could not hold out much longer when therefore the last hope was blighted by the wreck of two ships laden with provisions the Governor recognising the inutility of further resistance accepted the only alternative left him and at the second demand surrendered the heroic little town which amidst almost incredible difficulties had withstood the invaders an entire year

 To the thoroughly purified soul alone it belongs to fly without impediment to God as the needle flies to the magnet and admirable nay wonderful as was the interior purity to which this singularly favoured being had attained it had yet to undergo further processes of refinement before she should be disposed for the privilege awaiting her

 About this very period it happened that the Ursulines established themselves at Tours and as if to facilitate her introduction to them it further chanced that after a short time they removed from the house they had first inhabited to one quite near the residence of her brother

 Thenceforth she waited in silence and peace for the further manifestation of His designs and deeply as she prized her vocation she constantly prayed that if He willed her to work for Him in another sphere and another way He would raise insuperable obstacles to her ever going to Canada

 Andrew still further enlarged the Convent buildings by the addition of another wing containing the boarders parlour reception hall and music rooms

 Bristling cannon skillfully arranged on well constructed bastions swept the pass and rendered further advance apparently impossible

 The continuance of the war can not fail to diffuse them still further

 Louis resigned himself to his lot feeling the earth had no further joy in store for him

 They will go further than you imagine

 Next in wealth to the merchants the most thriving looking wanderer is the bearer of Ganges holy water who drives a profitable trade his gains increasing as his load lightens for the further he wanders from the sacred stream the more he gets for the contents of his jar

 and after a few hours rest I walked to the bungalow of Lieutenant Beadle the surveyor of roads sixteen miles further

 Further west again the ranges separate the southern still betraying a nucleus of granite forming the Satpur range which divides the valley of the Taptee from that of the Nerbudda

 Still further west the great rivers of the peninsula have their origin the Nerbudda and Taptee flowing west to the gulf of Cambay the Cane to the Jumna the Soane to the Ganges and the northern feeders of the Godavery to the Bay of Bengal

 This and Beejaghur higher up the Soane were amongst the most recently reduced forts and this was further the last of those wrested from Baber in 

 Further west where the climate becomes still drier the electricity of the air is even greater

 After waiting and entreating during several hours I found the head man of a neighbouring village and by a further disbursement induced six out of the twelve bearers to carry the empty palkee whilst I should walk to the next stage or till we should meet some others

 Walking along I picked up a few plants and fourteen miles further on came again to the banks of the Mahanuddee whose bed was strewn with pebbles and small boulders brought thus far from the mountains about thirty miles distant 

 Sikkim was further the only available spot for a Sanatarium throughout the whole range of the Himalaya east of the extreme western frontier of Nepal being a protected state and owing no allegiance except to the British government which after the Rajah had been driven from the country by the Ghorkas in replaced him on his throne and guaranteed him the sovereignty

 Grant were employed to report further on the subject

 His first demand was unreasonable but on further consideration he surrendered Dorjiling unconditionally and a sum of pounds per annum was granted to him as an equivalent for what was then a worthless uninhabited mountain

 The earliest traditions which they have of their history date no further back than some three hundred years when they describe themselves as having been long haired half clad savages

 The Magras a tribe now confined to Nepal west of the Arun are aborigines of Sikkim whence they were driven by the Lepchas westward into the country of the Limboos and by these latter further west still

 My head Lepcha went further to a due observance of demon worship he united a deep reverence for the Lamas and he venerated their symbols rather as theirs than as those of their religion

 Further they are often exposed to a winter s cold equal to the average of that of London the snow lying for a week on the ground and the thermometer descending to degrees

 We spent a few hours of alternate fog and sunshine on the top of the mountain vainly hoping for the most modest view our inability to obtain it was extremely disappointing for the mountain commands a superb prospect which I enjoyed fully in the following November from a spot a few miles further west

 Owing to the unsatisfactory nature of our relations with the Sikkim authorities to which I have elsewhere alluded my endeavours to procure leave to penetrate further beyond the Dorjiling territory than Tonglo were attended with some trouble and delay

 Pending further negotiations which Dr

 On the following day he appeared and after due admonishment we started but four miles further on were again obliged to halt for the Bhotan coolies who were equally deaf to threats and entreaties

 A little further on we crossed the main ridge of Sakkiazung a long flexuous chain stretching for miles to the westward from Phulloot on Singalelah and forming the most elevated and conspicuous transverse range in this part of Nepal its streams flow south to the Myong and north to feeders of the Tambur

 As we should not easily be able to procure food further on I laid in a full stock here and distributed blankets etc

 I had not then learnt how to treat such conduct and just before retiring to rest had further been informed by the Havildar that the Guobah declared we should find no food on our return

 I heard them toppling head over heels down the stair which I afterwards had drawn up to prevent further intrusion and in spite of their drunken orgies was soon lulled to sleep again by the music of the roaring river

 Nango is about feet high it is the next lofty mountain of the Kinchinjunga group to the west of Junnoo and I doubt if any equally high peak occurs again for some distance further west in Nepal

 The latter have only very recently been introduced amongst the Tibetans from the English garden at the Nepalese capital I believe and their culture has not spread in these regions further east than Kinchinjunga but they will very soon penetrate into Tibet from Dorjiling or eastward from Nepal

 Respiration had been difficult for some time and the guide we had taken from the village said we were some hours from the top of the pass and could get but a little way further we however proceeded plunging through the snow till on cresting the moraine a stupendous scene presented itself

 We could make no further progress the pass lay at the distance of several hours march up a valley to the north down which the glacier must have rolled that had deposited this great moraine the pass had been closed since October it being very lofty and the head of this valley was far more snowy than that at Wallanchoon

 I hoped too to find a pass into Sikkim east over Singalelah but was disappointed if there had ever been one it had been closed since the Nepal war and there was none for several marches further south which would conduct us to the Iwa branch of the Khabili

 Plenty of news was awaiting me here and a messenger with letters was three marches further north at Yoksun waiting my expected return over the Kanglanamo pass

 It may be supposed that moraines have transported them to feet the lowest limit of apparent moraines and the power of river water carried them further if so the rivers must have been of much greater volume formerly than they are now

 He is further the only servant of the Rajah capable of conversing both in Hindoo and Tibetan and the uneasy distrustful look of the Dewan who understands the latter language only was very evident

 The effect is quite deceptive the mountains assuming the appearance of a continued chain the distant snowy peaks being seemingly at little further distance than the nearer ones

 It is further assumable that the stratified rocks originally took the forms of great domes or arches

 feet is large eighty feet long and in excellent order built upon the lofty terminal point of the great east and west spur that divides the Kulhait from the Ratong and Rungbee rivers and the great Changachelling temple and monastery stand on another eminence of the same ridge two miles further west

 These birds migrate hither in October and November lingering in the Himalayan valleys till the cold of early spring drives them further south to the plains of India whence they return north in March and April

 feet where we encamped the coolies being unable to proceed further on such very bad roads

 I wondered what could have induced the frequenting of such a route to Nepal when there were so many better ones over Singalelah till I found from my guide that he had habitually smuggled salt over this pass to avoid the oppressive duty levelled by the Dewan on all imports from Tibet by the eastern passes he further told me that it took five days to reach Yalloong in Nepal front Yoksun on the third of which the Kanglanamo pass is crossed which is open from April to November but is always heavily snowed

 Mon Lepcha itself is a spur running south east from the Kubra shoulder it is very open and covered with rounded hills for several miles further north terminating in a conspicuous conical black hummock This I have beau told is the true Kubra and the great snowy mountain behind it which I here in conformity with the Dorjiling nomenclature call Kubra has no name being considered a part of Kinchin

 Gubroo he informs me is feet in altitude and dips in a precipice feet high facing Kubra which prevented his exploring further north

 Tree ferns here advance further north than in any other part of Sikkim

 In the afternoon I rode on leisurely to Titalya sixteen miles further along the banks of the Mahanuddy the atmosphere being so densely hazy that objects a few miles off were invisible and the sun quite concealed though its light was so powerful that no part of the sky could be steadily gazed upon

 M Clelland s theory citing those parts of Southern India which are least likely to be visited by dust storms as possessing an equally hazy atmosphere and further denies its being influenced by the hygrometric state of the atmosphere

 at degrees and the minimum at night is not below degrees great drought accompanies the heat at this season but not to such a degree as in North west India or other parts of this meridian further removed from the hills

 The coolness of the atmosphere was delicious and the beauty of the jungle seemed to increase the further we penetrated these primaeval forests

 The elephant drivers appeared to have taken us by mistake to the exit of the Chawa a small stream which joins the Teesta further to the eastward

 The name Teesta signifies quiet this river being so in comparison with other Himalayan torrents further west the Cosi Konki etc

 This river cuts a cliff from to feet high composed of stratified sand and water worn gravel further south the spur declines into the plains its course marked by the Sal that thrives on its gravelly soil

 Further on a third dip of about twenty feet in some places obliterated flanks the bed of the Balasun the river itself being split into many channels at this season

 I had rather expected to meet either with a guide or with some further obstruction here but as none appeared I proceeded onwards as soon as the weather moderated

 The cliffs here are covered with wild plantains and screw pines Pandanus feet high that clasp the rocks with cable like roots and bear one or two crowns of drooping leaves feet long two palms Rattan Calamus and Areca gracilis penetrate thus far up the Teesta valley but are scarcely found further

 He came again at daylight and expostulated further but finding it of no use he volunteered to accompany me officiously offering me the choice of two roads

 Owing however to the increasing distance and the destruction of the roads by the rains my supplies from that place were becoming irregular I therefore thought it prudent to reduce my party by sending back my guard of Sepoys who could be of no further use

 There is no village but some grass huts used by travellers which are built close to the river on a very broad flat fringed with alder hornbeam and birch the elevation is feet and many European genera not found about Dorjiling and belonging to the temperate Himalaya grow intermixed with tropical plants that are found no further north

 It is a remarkable fact that this hot damp gorge is never malarious this is attributable to the coolness of the river and to the water on the flats not stagnating for at Choongtam a march further north and feet higher fevers and ague prevail in summer on similar flats but which have been cleared of jungle and are therefore exposed to the sun

 It is hence quite unlike the forest clad mountains further south and indicates a drier and more sunny climate

 At feet the Abies Brunoniana is found a tree quite unknown further south but neither the larch nor the Albies Smithiana Khutrow accompanied it they being confined to still more northern regions

 The Singtam Soubah visited me daily and we enjoyed long friendly conversations he still insisted that the Yangchoo the name he gave to the Lachen at this place was the boundary and that I must not go any further

 In all matters respecting the frontier his lies were circumstantial and he further took the trouble of bringing country people to swear that this was Cheen and that there was no such place as Kongra Lama

 These are the most northern shrubs in Sikkim and I regarded them with deep interest as being possibly the last of their kind to be met with in this meridian for many degrees further north perhaps even no similar shrubs occur between this and the Siberian Altai a distance of miles

 Five miles further on we arrived at the tents of the Phipun whose wife was prepared to entertain us with Tartar hospitality magnificent tawny Tibet mastiffs were baying at the tent door and some yaks and ponies were grazing close by

 I remained here till the th of August Though degrees further north and feet above the level of Calcutta the mean temperature at Choongtam this month was only 

 I ascended over loose rocks to between and feet and reached vast masses of blue ribboned ice capping the ridges but obtained no further prospect

 Forty miles further north in Tibet the same line is probably at feet for there much less snow falls and much more melts in proportion

 Having sent the coolies forward with instructions to halt and camp on this side of the Kongra Lama pass we followed them taking the route by Palung and thence over the hills to the Lachen to the east of which we descended and further up its valley joined the advanced party in a rocky glen called Sitong an advantageous camping ground from being sheltered by rocks which ward off the keen blasts its elevation is feet above the sea and the magnificent west cliff of Kinchinjhow towers over it not a mile distant bearing due east and subtending an angle of 

 Beyond this I recognised a hill of which I had taken bearings from Donkia pass and a few miles further on rounding a great spur of Kinchinjunga I arrived in sight of Cholamoo lakes with the Donkia mountain rearing its stupendous precipices of rock and ice on the east

 The geese An enormous quantity of water fowl breed in Tibet including many Indian species that migrate no further north

 and consequent evaporation increased by the violent wind sufficiently accounts for the height of the snow line in further evidence of which I may add that a piece of ice or snow laid on the ground here does not melt but disappears by evaporation

 They proved to be of fossiliferous limestone the strata of which were much disturbed the strike appeared in one part north west and the dip north east degrees a large fault passed east by north through the cliff and it was further cleft by joints running northwards

 The next day we reached Rungpo where we halted for further instructions our tents were placed apart but we managed to correspond by stealth

 Campbell had been desired to attend the Durbar for the purpose of transacting business but had refused to go except by compulsion considering that in the excited state of the authorities amongst whom there was not one person of responsibility or judgment his presence would not only be useless but he might be exposed to further insult or possibly violence

 The particulars of our seizure and the reasons for it and for our further detention were unknown at Dorjiling or a very different line of policy would have been pursued

 The Dewan went on the th to a hot bath a few hundred feet down the hill he was led past our hut his burly frame tottering as if in great weakness but a more transparent fraud could not have been practised he was in fact lying on his oars pending further negotiations

 On the nd and rd December we had further conferences with the Dewan who said that we were to be taken to Dorjiling in six days with two Vakeels from the Rajah

 On the nd of December he marched us eight miles further to Cheadam on a bold spur feet high overlooking the Great Rungeet and facing Dorjiling from which it was only twenty miles distant

 It enabled me to survey the whole country and to execute a map of it and Campbell had further gained that knowledge of its resources which the British government should all along have possessed as the protector of the Rajah and his territories

 A large body of troops was however marched from Dorjiling and encamped on the north bank of the Great Rungeet for some weeks but after that period they were recalled without any further demonstration the Dewan remaining encamped the while on the Namtchi hill not three hours march above them

 To the inhabitants about souls this was a matter of congratulation for it only involved the payment of a small fixed tax in money to the treasury at Dorjiling instead of a fluctuating one in kind with service to the Rajah besides exempting them from further annoyance by the Dewan

 Since I left India these improvements have been still further carried out and now in the spring of I read of five splendid Victoria plants flowering at once with Euryale ferox white blue and red water lilies and white yellow and scarlet lotus rendering the tanks gorgeous sunk as their waters are in frames of green grass ornamented with clumps of Nipa fruticans and Phoenix paludosa

 I had seen both its native population and its European houses doubled in two years its salubrious climate its scenery and accessibility ensure it so rapid a further increase that it will become the most populous hill station in India

 degrees higher than at Calcutta which is miles further south

 Being at the head of the Gangetic delta which points from the Sunderbunds obliquely to the north west it is much damper than any locality further west as is evidenced by two kinds of Calamus palm abounding which do not ascend the Ganges beyond Monghyr

 This being the driest season of the year it is very probable that the mean level of the water at this part of the delta is not higher than that of the Bay of Bengal but as we advanced northwards towards the Khasia and entered the Soormah itself the atmospheric pressure increased further thus appearing to give the bed of that stream a depression of thirty five feet below the Bay of Bengal into which it flows This was no doubt the result of unequal atmospheric pressure at the two localities caused by the disturbance of the column of atmosphere by the Khasia mountains for in December of the same year thirty eight observations on the surface of the Soormah made its bed forty six feet above the Bay of Bengal whilst from twenty three observations on the Megna the pressure only differed 

 Large valleys enter the hills and are divided by hog backed spurs and it is far within these valleys that the waterfalls and precipices occur but the nearer and further cliffs being thrown by perspective into one range they seem to rise out of the Jheels so abruptly as to remind one of some precipitous island in the ocean

 It however forms further south at the very mouth of the Megna and is the effect of intense radiation when the thermometer in the shade falls to degrees

 of many kinds are very abundant and these hills further differ remarkably from those of Sikkim in the great number of species of grasses

 No rhododendron grows at Churra but several species occur a little further north there is but one pine P

 This fall is very local at Silhet not thirty miles further south it is under inches at Gowahatty north of the Khasia in Assam it is about and even on the hills twenty miles inland from Churra itself the fall is reduced to 

 Beyond Myrung the Khasia mountains slope to the southward in rolling loosely wooded hills but the spurs do not dip suddenly till beyond Nunklow eight miles further north

 This arrangement indicates that relation of the rivers to the masses of snow which I have dwelt upon in the Appendix and further tends to prove that the snowy mountains seen from the southward are not on the axis of a mountain chain and do not even indicate its position but that they are lofty meridional spurs which projecting southward catch the moist vapours become more deeply snowed and protect the dry loftier regions behind

 From Nunklow feet lower than Myrung they appear higher the western peak rising degrees minutes above the horizon whilst from Moflong miles further south and elevation feet the same is sunk degrees below the horizon

 It is further evident that these mountains have as far as can be estimated by angles fully feet of snow on them which would not be the case were the loftiest only feet high

 Further still to the extreme west is an immense low hog backed mass of snow with a small peak on it this bears north west both from Myrung and Nunklow subtending an angle of minutes from the former and minutes from the latter station

 Donkia if seen would be distant miles from the same spot in the Khasia and Kinchinjunga possibly they are visible by refraction from Chillong though even further from it

 The further we travel and the longer we study the more positive becomes the conviction that the part played by these great agents in sculpturing the surface of our planet is as yet but half recognised

 The smelting is very rudely carried on in charcoal fires blown by enormous double action bellows worked by two persons who stand on the machine raising the flaps with their hands and expanding them with their feet as shown in the cut further on

 I only saw however the skirts of the forest the mountains further east which I am told rise several thousand feet in limestone cliffs are doubtless richer in herbaceous plants

 Stainforth s house is upwards of degrees further north and feet more elevated

 Whether any further rise is caused by elevation from below is doubtful there is no direct evidence of it though slight earthquakes annually occur and even when they have not been felt the water of tanks has been seen to oscillate for three quarters of an hour without intermission from no discernible cause

 These islets which are often an acre in extent are composed of stratified mud they have perpendicular sides several feet high and convex surfaces owing to the tide washing away the earth from under their sides and they were further slipping seawards along the gently sloping mud beach

 The climate is very healthy which is not remarkable considering how closely it approximates in character to that of Silhet and other places in Eastern Bengal but very extraordinary if it be compared with Arracan only miles further south which is extremely unhealthy

 Large myrtaceous trees Eugenia are common and show a tendency to the Malayan flora which is further demonstrated by the abundance of Gurjun Dipterocarpus turbinatus 

 Newman and with considerable care they were in general accurate and always extremely well guarded and put up in the most portable form and that least likely to incur damage they were further frequently carefully compared by myself

 There is no break in this forest caused by rock precipices or cultivation some spurs project nearer and some valleys appear to retire further into the heart of the foremost great chain that shuts out all the country beyond

 of greater mean elevation further west introduced to show the maximum elevation of the Sikkim mountains Kinchinjunga feet being represented on it

 Passing on little will be precipitated on e whose elevation is the same as that of Sinchul but much at f feet where the current being further cooled has less capacity for holding vapour and is further exhausted

 I was therefore surprised to find no further register of the weather at Dorjiling than an insufficient one of the rain fall kept by the medical officer in charge of the station who in this as in all similar cases The government of India has gone to an immense expense and entailed a heavy duty upon its stationary medical officers in supplying them with sometimes admirable but more often very inaccurate meteorological instruments and requiring that daily registers be made and transmitted to Calcutta

 I have not added the boiling point observations which afford a further means of testing the accuracy of the barometric computations and which will be found in section J of this Appendix

 Fogg aside and begged him to reflect before he went any further to which that gentleman replied that he was not in the habit of acting rashly that a bet of twenty thousand pounds was at stake that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him and that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value

 In the Opera House a crowd had gathered to see a show and further down Main Street the fiddlers their instruments tuned sweated and worked to keep the feet of youth flying over a dance floor

 Though no doubt the fair copies we possess were revised with the care that characterises the man and which is evidenced by the interlineations and corrections in his own hand with which the pages are dotted it may be supposed from the example we have in the published account of his Second Voyage which was edited by himself that further alterations and additions would have been made to make the story more complete had he contemplated its being printed

 Though Cook himself gives at the beginning of the Journal a note of the method of reckoning days adopted it may not be amiss to give further explanation here

 The expedition to Quebec concluded Cook was appointed master of the Northumberland bearing Admiral Lord Colville s flag and during that ship s winter at Halifax he applied himself to further study of mathematics and astronomy

 The passage between the outer reef and the land is strewn with shoals and finding his further progress much impeded by them and fearful of a repetition of his disaster Cook with some difficulty found a channel to seaward and gained the open ocean

 Whilst here they gained further and indisputable proof of the cannibalistic tendencies of the Maoris some of the natives eating human flesh before them

 His crew had suffered from scurvy whereas Cook s had not but he says not one word of this nor does he give any reason why he gave up any further thought of the objects of the voyage except a search for Bouvet s Islands which he also looked for on his way

 He was further to look for any passage north of North America to the Atlantic and to make such other explorations as might seem fit to him

 Six weeks were spent here and the old friendships further cemented

 Standing further north he in latitude degrees minutes north came across the icy barrier of the Arctic Sea

 Still no further attack was made but the men in the boats hearing Cook s shot and seeing the excited crowd commenced to fire without orders

 Those intervals of recreation which sometimes unavoidably occurred and were looked for by us with a longing that persons who have experienced the fatigues of service will readily excuse were submitted to by him with a certain impatience whenever they could not be employed in making further provision for the more effectual prosecution of his designs

 The charms of Tahiti the paradise of the sailor were no charms for him he hardly notices the attractive ladies of that island the attractions of the place to him were the abundance of provisions as a means of fitting his expedition for further exploration and hardship

 Every Person employ d on shore on any duty whatsoever is strictly to attend to the same and if by neglect he looseth any of His Arms or working Tools or suffers them to be stole the full value thereof will be charged against his pay according to the Custom of the Navy in such Cases and he shall receive such further punishment as the nature of the Offence may deserve

 It hath been found both by the Dolphin and us that the trade winds in those parts of this Sea doth not extend further to the Southward than degrees and without which we generally meet with a wind from the westward

 It further appear d that the things which Tupia gave away was for the God of this People as they gave us a Hog and some Cocoanuts for our God and thus they have certainly drawn us in to commit sacriledge for the Hog hath already received sentence of Death and is to be dissected to morrow

 into the Harbour that is a full Quarter of a Mile broad still further to the North West are some other small Islands where I am informed is another small inlet but this I did not see but as to the other we enter d the Harbour by the one and came out by the other

 I did intend to have stood to the Southward if the winds had been Moderate so long as they continued Westerly notwithstanding we had no prospect of meeting with land Rather than stand back to the Northward on the same Track as we came but as the weather was so very Tempestious I laid aside this design and thought it more adviseable to stand to the Northward into better weather least we should receive such Damage in our Sails and Rigging as might hinder the further Prosecutions of the Voyage

 This Bay is not so much Shelter d from the Sea as I at first thought it was but as the Natives many of whom came about us in their Canoes appear d to be of a friendly disposition I was willing to try if we could not get a little water on board and to see a little into the Nature of the Country before we proceeded further to the Northward

 some of our people found in the Skirts of the Wood hip Bones of Men they lay near to a Hole or Oven that is a place where the Natives dress their Victuals this Circumstance trifling as it is is still a further proof that these people eat human flesh

 From Cape Morton the Land Trends away West further than we could see for there is a small space where we could see no land some on board where of opinion that there is a River there because the Sea looked paler than usual

 By the first it will appear that to the Southward of or degrees the land in general is low and level with very few Hills or Mountains further to the Northward it may in some places be called a Hilly but hardly anywhere can be called a Mountainous Country for the Hills and Mountains put together take up but a small part of the Surface in Comparison to what the Planes and Valleys do which intersect or divide these Hills and Mountains

 On the Contrary Leagues further to the North West on the South side of Keppel Bay we found the Flood to come from the East and at the Northern part of the said Bay we found it come from the Northward but with a much Slower Motion than the Easterly Tide

 Before we proceed any further it will be proper in this place to say something of the Island we have been last at which is called by the Natives Savu

 We had but little Wind all night and having a Strong Current against us we got no further by o Clock in the morning than under Bantam Point

 The false Kiel gone beyond the Midships from Forward and perhaps further as I had no opportunity of seeing for the water when hauld ashore for repair

 As we could not Sail in the Morning for want of wind I sent a Boat to the Island for a few Trifling Articles we had forgot to take in at the Cape but the people on shore would not permit her to land so that she return d as she went and I gave myself no further Trouble at it

 Now I am upon the Subject of discoveries I hope it will not be taken amiss if I give it as my opinion that the most feasable method of making further discoveries in the South Sea is to enter it by the way of New Zeland first touching and refreshing at the Cape of Good Hope from thence proceed to the Southward of New Holland for Queen Charlotte s Sound where again refresh Wood and water taking care to be ready to leave that place by the latter end of September or beginning of October at farthest when you would have the whole Summer before you and after getting through the Strait might with the prevailing Westerly Winds run to the Eastward in as high a Latitude as you please and if you meet with no lands would have time enough to get round Cape Horne before the Summer was too far spent but if after meeting with no Continent and you had other objects in view then haul to the Northward and after visiting some of the Islands already discovered after which proceed with the trade wind back to the Westward in search of those before mentioned thus the discoveries in the South Sea would be compleat

 As the deceased had taken no further notice of his nephew in his lifetime than sending to his eldest boy who had been christened after him on desperate speculation a silver spoon in a morocco case which as he had not too much to eat with it seemed a kind of satire upon his having been born without that useful article of plate in his mouth Mr Godfrey Nickleby could at first scarcely believe the tidings thus conveyed to him

 Nevertheless as he lived in a spacious house in Golden Square which in addition to a brass plate upon the street door had another brass plate two sizes and a half smaller upon the left hand door post surrounding a brass model of an infant s fist grasping a fragment of a skewer and displaying the word Office it was clear that Mr Ralph Nickleby did or pretended to do business of some kind and the fact if it required any further circumstantial evidence was abundantly demonstrated by the diurnal attendance between the hours of half past nine and five of a sallow faced man in rusty brown who sat upon an uncommonly hard stool in a species of butler s pantry at the end of the passage and always had a pen behind his ear when he answered the bell

 Perhaps you will have the kindness to take a card of terms with you Thank you good morning Good morning ma am said Ralph shutting the door abruptly after him to prevent any further conversation

 Do you hear As this admonition was accompanied with a threatening gesture and uttered with a savage aspect the little boy rubbed his face harder as if to keep the tears back and beyond alternately sniffing and choking gave no further vent to his emotions

 How do you do my little gentleman and how do you do sir With this salutation Mr Squeers patted the heads of two hollow eyed small boned little boys whom the applicant had brought with him and waited for further communications

 At first Nicholas thought the mysterious man was in a fit but on further consideration decided that he was in liquor under which circumstances he deemed it prudent to make off at once

 The little pupils having been stimulated with the remains of their breakfast and further invigorated by sundry small cups of a curious cordial carried by Mr Squeers which tasted very like toast and water put into a brandy bottle by mistake went to sleep woke shivered and cried as their feelings prompted

 A stage or two further on the lamps were lighted and a great to do occasioned by the taking up at a roadside inn of a very fastidious lady with an infinite variety of cloaks and small parcels who loudly lamented for the behoof of the outsides the non arrival of her own carriage which was to have taken her on and made the guard solemnly promise to stop every green chariot he saw coming which as it was a dark night and he was sitting with his face the other way that officer undertook with many fervent asseverations to do

 Twenty miles further on two of the front outside passengers wisely availing themselves of their arrival at one of the best inns in England turned in for the night at the George at Grantham

 Grasping the rail he found that the coach had sunk greatly on one side though it was still dragged forward by the horses and while confused by their plunging and the loud screams of the lady inside he hesitated for an instant whether to jump off or not the vehicle turned easily over and relieved him from all further uncertainty by flinging him into the road

 As the lady condescended to make no reply but tossed her head contemptuously and murmured some further expression of surprise regarding the absence of the green chariot one or two voices urged upon the president himself the propriety of making an attempt for the general benefit

 After some further conversation between the master and mistress relative to the success of Mr Squeers s trip and the people who had paid and the people who had made default in payment a young servant girl brought in a Yorkshire pie and some cold beef which being set upon the table the boy Smike appeared with a jug of ale

 Now Nickleby come tumble up will you Nicholas needed no further admonition but tumbled up at once and proceeded to dress himself by the light of the taper which Mr Squeers carried in his hand

 Don t stand staring at me but do look sharp will you Offering no further observation Nicholas huddled on his clothes

 Mrs Squeers came in still habited in the primitive night jacket which had displayed the symmetry of her figure on the previous night and further ornamented with a beaver bonnet of some antiquity which she wore with much ease and lightness on the top of the nightcap before mentioned

 Having further disposed of a slice of bread and butter allotted to him in virtue of his office he sat himself down to wait for school time

 Miss Squeers having slight misgivings on the subject was by no means ill pleased to be confirmed by a competent authority and discovering on further conversation and comparison of notes a great many points of resemblance between the behaviour of Nicholas and that of the corn factor grew so exceedingly confidential that she intrusted her friend with a vast number of things Nicholas had NOT said which were all so very complimentary as to be quite conclusive

 Kate poured forth many thanks for her uncle s consideration which Ralph received as if he had deserved them all and they arrived without any further conversation at the dressmaker s door which displayed a very large plate with Madame Mantalini s name and occupation and was approached by a handsome flight of steps

 Newman was very very far from having the appearance of a gouty subject and so Kate could not help thinking but the conference was cut short by Mrs Nickleby s insisting on having the door shut lest Mr Noggs should take cold and further persisting in sending the servant girl for a coach for fear he should bring on another attack of his disorder

 CHAPTER Whereby the Reader will be enabled to trace the further course of Miss Fanny Squeer s Love and to ascertain whether it ran smooth or otherwise

 No Tilda replied Miss Squeers it is my duty to go through with it and I will As Miss Squeers said this in the tone of one who has made a high moral resolution and was besides taken with one or two chokes and catchings of breath indicative of feelings at a high pressure her friend made no further remark and they bore straight down upon Nicholas who walking with his eyes bent upon the ground was not aware of their approach until they were close upon him otherwise he might perhaps have taken shelter himself

 On tiptoe it was destined to remain however until afternoon when Squeers having refreshed himself with his dinner and further strengthened himself by an extra libation or so made his appearance accompanied by his amiable partner with a countenance of portentous import and a fearful instrument of flagellation strong supple wax ended and new in short purchased that morning expressly for the occasion

 I should be many steps further on by this time and so goodbye Nay noo replied the honest countryman reining in his impatient horse stan still tellee

 Mr Gregsbury reflected blew his nose threw himself further back in his chair came forward again leaning his elbows on the table made a triangle with his two thumbs and his two forefingers and tapping his nose with the apex thereof replied smiling as he said it I deny everything

 Nicholas took a chair and Mr Gregsbury stared at him for a long time as if to make certain before he asked any further questions that there were no objections to his outward appearance

 It may be further remarked that Miss Knag still aimed at youth although she had shot beyond it years ago and that she was weak and vain and one of those people who are best described by the axiom that you may trust them as far as you can see them and no farther

 Oh well There it is at once you know how can you possibly pronounce an opinion about a gentleman hem if you don t see him as he turns out altogether There was so much of the world even of the little world of the country girl in this idea of the old milliner that Kate who was anxious for every reason to change the subject made no further remark and left Miss Knag in possession of the field

 There had existed not a little desire in the room according to invariable custom when any new young person came to know who Kate was and what she was and all about her but although it might have been very naturally increased by her appearance and emotion the knowledge that it pained her to be questioned was sufficient to repress even this curiosity and Miss Knag finding it hopeless to attempt extracting any further particulars just then reluctantly commanded silence and bade the work proceed

 Have you any further commands for me No I have not ma am rejoined Miss La Creevy

 The attendants were not slow to echo the sigh and Miss Knag was apparently on the eve of favouring them with some further moral reflections when the voice of Madame Mantalini conveyed through the speaking tube ordered Miss Nickleby upstairs to assist in the arrangement of the show room a distinction which caused Miss Knag to toss her head so much and bite her lips so hard that her powers of conversation were for the time annihilated

 After a delay of two or three hours the young ladies were informed that their services would be dispensed with until further notice and at the expiration of two days the name of Mantalini appeared in the list of bankrupts Miss Nickleby received an intimation per post on the same morning that the business would be in future carried on under the name of Miss Knag and that her assistance would no longer be required a piece of intelligence with which Mrs Nickleby was no sooner made acquainted than that good lady declared she had expected it all along and cited divers unknown occasions on which she had prophesied to that precise effect

 A glance at the toil worn face of Smike determined Nicholas so without any further consideration he made up his mind to stay where he was

 The landlord hurried into the parlour without staying for further permission nor did Nicholas strive to prevent him wisely considering that supper under the circumstances was too serious a matter to be trifled with

 For further particulars see small hand bills we might have half a volume in every one of em

 CHAPTER Concerning a young Lady from London who joins the Company and an elderly Admirer who follows in her Train with an affecting Ceremony consequent on their Arrival The new piece being a decided hit was announced for every evening of performance until further notice and the evenings when the theatre was closed were reduced from three in the week to two

 Regardless of this circumstance however Mrs Lillyvick refused to be comforted until the belligerents had passed their words that the dispute should be carried no further which after a sufficient show of reluctance they did and from that time Mr Folair sat in moody silence contenting himself with pinching Nicholas s leg when anything was said and so expressing his contempt both for the speaker and the sentiments to which he gave utterance

 So I did rejoined his friend but I have thought further of the matter since then

 Pooh pooh I tell you returned Mr Folair waving his hand in deprecation of any further wrath I wasn t in earnest

 Finding Nicholas bent upon quitting the society for he had now determined that even if no further tidings came from Newman he would at all hazards ease his mind by repairing to London and ascertaining the exact position of his sister Mr Crummles was fain to content himself by calculating the chances of his coming back again and taking prompt and energetic measures to make the most of him before he went away

 This declaration was followed by a similar attempt on the bandbox and similar demonstrations on the part of Miss Ledrook and then both ladies vowed that they wouldn t move a step further until Nicholas had promised that he wouldn t offer to peep again

 At last Nicholas pledged himself to betray no further curiosity and they walked on both ladies giggling very much and declaring that they never had seen such a wicked creature in all their born days never

 Upon further discussion this appeared the safest and most feasible mode of proceeding that could possibly be adopted

 Sir Mulberry however who was not quite sober and who was in a sullen and dogged state of obstinacy soon silenced the representations of his weak young friend and further seemed as if to save himself from a repetition of them to insist on being left alone

 The result was that without quite giving up the allowance question Madame Mantalini postponed its further consideration and Ralph saw clearly enough that Mr Mantalini had gained a fresh lease of his easy life and that for some time longer at all events his degradation and downfall were postponed

 Brighter Days seem to dawn upon the Family Having established his mother and sister in the apartments of the kind hearted miniature painter and ascertained that Sir Mulberry Hawk was in no danger of losing his life Nicholas turned his thoughts to poor Smike who after breakfasting with Newman Noggs had remained in a disconsolate state at that worthy creature s lodgings waiting with much anxiety for further intelligence of his protector

 As he appeared in a most extraordinary condition of restless excitement and whenever Nicholas offered to speak immediately interposed with Don t say another word my dear sir on any account not another word the young man thought it better to attempt no further interruption

 They went in without further parley

 When you say that no further inquiries are needed

 When he at last glided out of the dark doorway corner in which he had been compelled to halt he caught a glimpse of the twins stealthily peeping in at one corner of the glass case evidently undecided whether they should follow up their late attack without delay or for the present postpone laying further siege to the inflexible Tim Linkinwater

 Mr Kenwigs was about to make some further observations most probably in confirmation of this opinion when another married lady who had looked in to keep up Mrs Kenwigs s spirits and help to clear off anything in the eating and drinking way that might be going about put in her head to announce that she had just been down to answer the bell and that there was a gentleman at the door who wanted to see Mr Kenwigs most particular

 Having seen him sound asleep and heard him snore most satisfactorily and having further presided over the distribution of the toys to the perfect contentment of all the little Kenwigses Nicholas took his leave

 CHAPTER Nicholas finds further Favour in the Eyes of the brothers Cheeryble and Mr Timothy Linkinwater

 This history concluded brother Ned related how that exactly thirty five years ago Tim Linkinwater was suspected to have received a love letter and how that vague information had been brought to the counting house of his having been seen walking down Cheapside with an uncommonly handsome spinster at which there was a roar of laughter and Tim Linkinwater being charged with blushing and called upon to explain denied that the accusation was true and further that there would have been any harm in it if it had been which last position occasioned the superannuated bank clerk to laugh tremendously and to declare that it was the very best thing he had ever heard in his life and that Tim Linkinwater might say a great many things before he said anything which would beat THAT

 Nicholas laughed and entering no further into the subject of this lengthened harangue reverted to the pleasant tone of the little birthday party

 Wheel that table away and place a chair there further off

 To have seen Miss Squeers now divested of the brown beaver the green veil and the blue curl papers and arrayed in all the virgin splendour of a white frock and spencer with a white muslin bonnet and an imitative damask rose in full bloom on the inside thereof her luxuriant crop of hair arranged in curls so tight that it was impossible they could come out by any accident and her bonnet cap trimmed with little damask roses which might be supposed to be so many promising scions of the big rose to have seen all this and to have seen the broad damask belt matching both the family rose and the little roses which encircled her slender waist and by a happy ingenuity took off from the shortness of the spencer behind to have beheld all this and to have taken further into account the coral bracelets rather short of beads and with a very visible black string which clasped her wrists and the coral necklace which rested on her neck supporting outside her frock a lonely cornelian heart typical of her own disengaged affections to have contemplated all these mute but expressive appeals to the purest feelings of our nature might have thawed the frost of age and added new and inextinguishable fuel to the fire of youth

 John Browdie s only reply was another squeeze of the hand and an assurance that they would not begin to see London till tomorrow so that they might be at Mr Snawley s at six o clock without fail and after some further conversation Mr Squeers and his son departed

 Nicholas hazarded one or two further remarks but it was evident that Tim Linkinwater had his own reasons for evading the subject and that he was determined to afford no further information respecting the fair unknown who had awakened so much curiosity in the breast of his young friend

 He further related how it required much moving and great eloquence to bring the young lady to this pass how it was expressly understood that she merely afforded Nicholas an opportunity of declaring his passion and how she by no means pledged herself to be favourably impressed with his attentions

 It appeared on further questioning for it was only by a very long and arduous process that all this could be got out of Newman Noggs that Newman in explanation of his shabby appearance had represented himself as being for certain wise and indispensable purposes connected with that intrigue in disguise and being questioned how he had come to exceed his commission so far as to procure an interview he responded that the lady appearing willing to grant it he considered himself bound both in duty and gallantry to avail himself of such a golden means of enabling Nicholas to prosecute his addresses

 Thinking it best to take the hint in good part Nicholas descended without further remonstrance but with a countenance bespeaking anything rather than the hope and rapture of a passionate lover

 They exchanged no further words and there Nicholas stood listening to the loud breathing of Newman Noggs and imagining that his nose seemed to glow like a red hot coal even in the midst of the darkness which enshrouded them

 Mrs Nickleby readily assented and to the summer house they repaired without further discussion

 Kate looked very much perplexed and was apparently about to ask for further explanation when a shouting and scuffling noise as of an elderly gentleman whooping and kicking up his legs on loose gravel with great violence was heard to proceed from the same direction as the former sounds and before they had subsided a large cucumber was seen to shoot up in the air with the velocity of a sky rocket whence it descended tumbling over and over until it fell at Mrs Nickleby s feet

 Bestowing no further notice upon his eccentric follower than a threatening look and an admonition to be careful and make no mistake Ralph took his hat and gloves and walked out

 Ralph in no wise moved by what had lately passed further than as he had already expressed himself walked deliberately on and turning out of the Park and leaving Golden Square on his right took his way through some streets at the west end of the town until he arrived in that particular one in which stood the residence of Madame Mantalini

 Come here do you hear me girl Without any further expostulation he led or rather pulled the frightened handmaid into the house and shut the door then bidding her walk upstairs before him followed without more ceremony

 In future he shall support himself if he can and then he may spend what money he pleases upon whom and how he pleases but it shall not be mine and therefore you had better pause before you trust him further

 Kate clung closer to his arm Smike retreated behind them and John Browdie who had heard of Ralph and appeared to have no great difficulty in recognising him stepped between the old man and his young friend as if with the intention of preventing either of them from advancing a step further

 He would enter into no further discussion of the subject and while old Arthur dilated upon the enormity of his demands and proposed modifications of them approaching by degrees nearer and nearer to the terms he resisted sat perfectly mute looking with an air of quiet abstraction over the entries and papers in his pocket book

 Nicholas having highly commended the resolution Mr Crummles went on to impart such further intelligence relative to their mutual friends as he thought might prove interesting informing Nicholas among other things that Miss Snevellicci was happily married to an affluent young wax chandler who had supplied the theatre with candles and that Mr Lillyvick didn t dare to say his soul was his own such was the tyrannical sway of Mrs Lillyvick who reigned paramount and supreme

 CHAPTER Chronicles the further Proceedings of the Nickleby Family and the Sequel of the Adventure of the Gentleman in the Small clothes While Nicholas absorbed in the one engrossing subject of interest which had recently opened upon him occupied his leisure hours with thoughts of Madeline Bray and in execution of the commissions which the anxiety of brother Charles in her behalf imposed upon him saw her again and again and each time with greater danger to his peace of mind and a more weakening effect upon the lofty resolutions he had formed Mrs Nickleby and Kate continued to live in peace and quiet agitated by no other cares than those which were connected with certain harassing proceedings taken by Mr Snawley for the recovery of his son and their anxiety for Smike himself whose health long upon the wane began to be so much affected by apprehension and uncertainty as sometimes to occasion both them and Nicholas considerable uneasiness and even alarm

 Upon further inquiry it turned out to the good lady s unbounded astonishment that Smike had that moment gone upstairs to bed

 Ah Train up a Ghost child I mean Any further reflections on this fruitful theme were abruptly cut short by the arrival of Tim Linkinwater and Mr Frank Cheeryble in the hurry of receiving whom Mrs Nickleby speedily lost sight of everything else

 But as all this time he had never left off singing about the bankruptcy of the beautiful maid in respect of truth and now began not only to croak very feebly but to kick with great violence as if respiration became a task of difficulty Frank Cheeryble without further hesitation pulled at the shorts and worsteds with such heartiness as to bring him floundering into the room with greater precipitation than he had quite calculated upon

 As their freedom from all further apprehension however left no pretext for his insisting on mounting guard he was obliged to abandon the citadel and to retire with the trusty Tim

 With this rejoinder and waiting for no further discussion Sir Mulberry Hawk yawned and very leisurely turned back

 It was a profligate haunt of the worst repute and not a place in which such an affair was likely to awaken any sympathy for either party or to call forth any further remonstrance or interposition

 Elsewhere its further progress would have been instantly prevented and time allowed for sober and cool reflection but not there

 Make no further visits to the girl in the meantime

 What had been hinted with reference to some fraud on Madeline had been put with sufficient obscurity by Arthur Gride but coming from Newman Noggs and obscured still further by the smoke of his pocket pistol it became wholly unintelligible and involved in utter darkness

 Newman had been a silent spectator of this scene for Mr Lillyvick had signed to him not to withdraw and Mr Kenwigs had further solicited his presence by a nod of invitation

 When I see that man said Mr Kenwigs with one hand round Mrs Kenwigs s waist his other hand supporting his pipe which made him wink and cough very much for he was no smoker and his eyes on Morleena who sat upon her uncle s knee when I see that man as mingling once again in the spear which he adorns and see his affections deweloping themselves in legitimate sitiwations I feel that his nature is as elewated and expanded as his standing afore society as a public character is unimpeached and the woices of my infant children purvided for in life seem to whisper to me softly This is an ewent at which Evins itself looks down CHAPTER Containing the further Progress of the Plot contrived by Mr Ralph Nickleby and Mr Arthur Gride With that settled resolution and steadiness of purpose to which extreme circumstances so often give birth acting upon far less excitable and more sluggish temperaments than that which was the lot of Madeline Bray s admirer Nicholas started at dawn of day from the restless couch which no sleep had visited on the previous night and prepared to make that last appeal by whose slight and fragile thread her only remaining hope of escape depended

 There he continued after a short silence you have your message and can retire unless you have any further ha any further orders

 Remembering on further cogitation however that under any circumstances he must have paid or handsomely compounded for Ralph s debt and being by no means confident that he would have succeeded had he undertaken his enterprise alone he regained his equanimity and chattered and mowed over more satisfactory items until the entrance of Peg Sliderskew interrupted him

 I ain t doing any harm here am I Arthur Gride in reply repeated the word bell as loud as he could roar and his meaning being rendered further intelligible to Mrs Sliderskew s dull sense of hearing by pantomime expressive of ringing at a street door Peg hobbled out after sharply demanding why he hadn t said there was a ring before instead of talking about all manner of things that had nothing to do with it and keeping her half pint of beer waiting on the steps

 The room had no other light than that which it derived from a dim and dirt clogged lamp whose lazy wick being still further obscured by a dark shade cast its feeble rays over a very little space and left all beyond in heavy shadow

 He drew Ralph Nickleby to the further end of the room and pointed towards Gride who sat huddled together in a corner fumbling nervously with the buttons of his coat and exhibiting a face of which every skulking and base expression was sharpened and aggravated to the utmost by his anxiety and trepidation

 That knowing what I do you dare not tempt me further said Nicholas and by this better right that those I serve and with whom you would have done me base wrong and injury are her nearest and her dearest friends

 After a preliminary raising of his spirits with the information that she considered the patient decidedly worse she would further cheer him up by relating how dull listless and low spirited Miss Bray was because Kate foolishly talked about nothing else but him and family matters

 After waiting until late in the afternoon tortured by various apprehensions and misgivings and the recollection of the warning which his nephew had given him when they last met the further confirmation of which now presented itself in one shape of probability now in another and haunted him perpetually he left home and scarcely knowing why save that he was in a suspicious and agitated mood betook himself to Snawley s house

 Do you hear I hear rejoined Mrs Snawley taking no further notice of the request

 We feel now that further delicacy and consideration would be misplaced and if we confer together it must be as we are or not at all

 It being found however that he held no further communication with Ralph nor any with Snawley and lived quite alone they were completely at fault the watch was withdrawn and they would have observed his motions no longer if it had not happened that one night Newman stumbled unobserved on him and Ralph in the street together

 As far as in me lies I will deserve it and if I have wavered in my bounden duty to them before I am now determined to discharge it rigidly and to put further delays and temptations beyond my reach

 The night has come Is there no way to rob them of further triumph and spurn their mercy and compassion Is there no devil to help me Swiftly there glided again into his brain the figure he had raised that night

 Without any further explanation Mrs Nickleby Miss La Creevy and brother Ned were left alone together and Nicholas followed brother Charles into his private room where to his great astonishment he encountered Frank whom he supposed to be abroad

 The success of this first achievement prompted the malicious crowd whose faces were clustered together in every variety of lank and half starved ugliness to further acts of outrage

 And lo my further course a stream cut off Which tow rd the left hand with its little waves Bent down the grass that on its margin sprang

 And when the car was opposite to me Thunder was heard and all that folk august Seemed to have further progress interdicted There with the vanward ensigns standing still

 Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward To wait for further blows or little girl Or other vanity of such brief use

 But if this rarity go not through and through There needs must be a limit beyond which Its contrary prevents the further passing And thence the foreign radiance is reflected Even as a colour cometh back from glass The which behind itself concealeth lead

 Thou fain wouldst know if with another service For broken vow can such return be made As to secure the soul from further claim

 Now art thou certain of the greater point But because Holy Church in this dispenses Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee Behoves thee still to sit awhile at table Because the solid food which thou hast taken Requireth further aid for thy digestion

 Now round about in this consistory Much mayst thou contemplate if these my words Be gathered up without all further aid

 Dante s realms are further subdivided the Inferno is composed of nine levels the vestibule makes a tenth

 In the Inferno sinners are organized by three vices Incontinence Violence and Fraud and further subdivided by the seven deadly sins

 Paradise is organized on the basis of three types of Divine Love and further subdivided according to the three theological and four cardinal virtues

 Next in wealth to the merchants the most thriving looking wanderer is the bearer of Ganges holy water who drives a profitable trade his gains increasing as his load lightens for the further he wanders from the sacred stream the more he gets for the contents of his jar

 and after a few hours rest I walked to the bungalow of Lieutenant Beadle the surveyor of roads sixteen miles further

 Further west again the ranges separate the southern still betraying a nucleus of granite forming the Satpur range which divides the valley of the Taptee from that of the Nerbudda

 Still further west the great rivers of the peninsula have their origin the Nerbudda and Taptee flowing west to the gulf of Cambay the Cane to the Jumna the Soane to the Ganges and the northern feeders of the Godavery to the Bay of Bengal

 This and Beejaghur higher up the Soane were amongst the most recently reduced forts and this was further the last of those wrested from Baber in 

 Further west where the climate becomes still drier the electricity of the air is even greater

 After waiting and entreating during several hours I found the head man of a neighbouring village and by a further disbursement induced six out of the twelve bearers to carry the empty palkee whilst I should walk to the next stage or till we should meet some others

 Walking along I picked up a few plants and fourteen miles further on came again to the banks of the Mahanuddee whose bed was strewn with pebbles and small boulders brought thus far from the mountains about thirty miles distant 

 Sikkim was further the only available spot for a Sanatarium throughout the whole range of the Himalaya east of the extreme western frontier of Nepal being a protected state and owing no allegiance except to the British government which after the Rajah had been driven from the country by the Ghorkas in replaced him on his throne and guaranteed him the sovereignty

 Grant were employed to report further on the subject

 His first demand was unreasonable but on further consideration he surrendered Dorjiling unconditionally and a sum of pounds per annum was granted to him as an equivalent for what was then a worthless uninhabited mountain

 The earliest traditions which they have of their history date no further back than some three hundred years when they describe themselves as having been long haired half clad savages

 The Magras a tribe now confined to Nepal west of the Arun are aborigines of Sikkim whence they were driven by the Lepchas westward into the country of the Limboos and by these latter further west still

 My head Lepcha went further to a due observance of demon worship he united a deep reverence for the Lamas and he venerated their symbols rather as theirs than as those of their religion

 Further they are often exposed to a winter s cold equal to the average of that of London the snow lying for a week on the ground and the thermometer descending to degrees

 We spent a few hours of alternate fog and sunshine on the top of the mountain vainly hoping for the most modest view our inability to obtain it was extremely disappointing for the mountain commands a superb prospect which I enjoyed fully in the following November from a spot a few miles further west

 Owing to the unsatisfactory nature of our relations with the Sikkim authorities to which I have elsewhere alluded my endeavours to procure leave to penetrate further beyond the Dorjiling territory than Tonglo were attended with some trouble and delay

 Pending further negotiations which Dr

 On the following day he appeared and after due admonishment we started but four miles further on were again obliged to halt for the Bhotan coolies who were equally deaf to threats and entreaties

 A little further on we crossed the main ridge of Sakkiazung a long flexuous chain stretching for miles to the westward from Phulloot on Singalelah and forming the most elevated and conspicuous transverse range in this part of Nepal its streams flow south to the Myong and north to feeders of the Tambur

 As we should not easily be able to procure food further on I laid in a full stock here and distributed blankets etc

 I had not then learnt how to treat such conduct and just before retiring to rest had further been informed by the Havildar that the Guobah declared we should find no food on our return

 I heard them toppling head over heels down the stair which I afterwards had drawn up to prevent further intrusion and in spite of their drunken orgies was soon lulled to sleep again by the music of the roaring river

 Nango is about feet high it is the next lofty mountain of the Kinchinjunga group to the west of Junnoo and I doubt if any equally high peak occurs again for some distance further west in Nepal

 The latter have only very recently been introduced amongst the Tibetans from the English garden at the Nepalese capital I believe and their culture has not spread in these regions further east than Kinchinjunga but they will very soon penetrate into Tibet from Dorjiling or eastward from Nepal

 Respiration had been difficult for some time and the guide we had taken from the village said we were some hours from the top of the pass and could get but a little way further we however proceeded plunging through the snow till on cresting the moraine a stupendous scene presented itself

 We could make no further progress the pass lay at the distance of several hours march up a valley to the north down which the glacier must have rolled that had deposited this great moraine the pass had been closed since October it being very lofty and the head of this valley was far more snowy than that at Wallanchoon

 I hoped too to find a pass into Sikkim east over Singalelah but was disappointed if there had ever been one it had been closed since the Nepal war and there was none for several marches further south which would conduct us to the Iwa branch of the Khabili

 Plenty of news was awaiting me here and a messenger with letters was three marches further north at Yoksun waiting my expected return over the Kanglanamo pass

 It may be supposed that moraines have transported them to feet the lowest limit of apparent moraines and the power of river water carried them further if so the rivers must have been of much greater volume formerly than they are now

 He is further the only servant of the Rajah capable of conversing both in Hindoo and Tibetan and the uneasy distrustful look of the Dewan who understands the latter language only was very evident

 The effect is quite deceptive the mountains assuming the appearance of a continued chain the distant snowy peaks being seemingly at little further distance than the nearer ones

 It is further assumable that the stratified rocks originally took the forms of great domes or arches

 feet is large eighty feet long and in excellent order built upon the lofty terminal point of the great east and west spur that divides the Kulhait from the Ratong and Rungbee rivers and the great Changachelling temple and monastery stand on another eminence of the same ridge two miles further west

 These birds migrate hither in October and November lingering in the Himalayan valleys till the cold of early spring drives them further south to the plains of India whence they return north in March and April

 feet where we encamped the coolies being unable to proceed further on such very bad roads

 I wondered what could have induced the frequenting of such a route to Nepal when there were so many better ones over Singalelah till I found from my guide that he had habitually smuggled salt over this pass to avoid the oppressive duty levelled by the Dewan on all imports from Tibet by the eastern passes he further told me that it took five days to reach Yalloong in Nepal front Yoksun on the third of which the Kanglanamo pass is crossed which is open from April to November but is always heavily snowed

 Mon Lepcha itself is a spur running south east from the Kubra shoulder it is very open and covered with rounded hills for several miles further north terminating in a conspicuous conical black hummock This I have beau told is the true Kubra and the great snowy mountain behind it which I here in conformity with the Dorjiling nomenclature call Kubra has no name being considered a part of Kinchin

 Gubroo he informs me is feet in altitude and dips in a precipice feet high facing Kubra which prevented his exploring further north

 Tree ferns here advance further north than in any other part of Sikkim

 In the afternoon I rode on leisurely to Titalya sixteen miles further along the banks of the Mahanuddy the atmosphere being so densely hazy that objects a few miles off were invisible and the sun quite concealed though its light was so powerful that no part of the sky could be steadily gazed upon

 M Clelland s theory citing those parts of Southern India which are least likely to be visited by dust storms as possessing an equally hazy atmosphere and further denies its being influenced by the hygrometric state of the atmosphere

 at degrees and the minimum at night is not below degrees great drought accompanies the heat at this season but not to such a degree as in North west India or other parts of this meridian further removed from the hills

 The coolness of the atmosphere was delicious and the beauty of the jungle seemed to increase the further we penetrated these primaeval forests

 The elephant drivers appeared to have taken us by mistake to the exit of the Chawa a small stream which joins the Teesta further to the eastward

 The name Teesta signifies quiet this river being so in comparison with other Himalayan torrents further west the Cosi Konki etc

 This river cuts a cliff from to feet high composed of stratified sand and water worn gravel further south the spur declines into the plains its course marked by the Sal that thrives on its gravelly soil

 Further on a third dip of about twenty feet in some places obliterated flanks the bed of the Balasun the river itself being split into many channels at this season

 I had rather expected to meet either with a guide or with some further obstruction here but as none appeared I proceeded onwards as soon as the weather moderated

 The cliffs here are covered with wild plantains and screw pines Pandanus feet high that clasp the rocks with cable like roots and bear one or two crowns of drooping leaves feet long two palms Rattan Calamus and Areca gracilis penetrate thus far up the Teesta valley but are scarcely found further

 He came again at daylight and expostulated further but finding it of no use he volunteered to accompany me officiously offering me the choice of two roads

 Owing however to the increasing distance and the destruction of the roads by the rains my supplies from that place were becoming irregular I therefore thought it prudent to reduce my party by sending back my guard of Sepoys who could be of no further use

 There is no village but some grass huts used by travellers which are built close to the river on a very broad flat fringed with alder hornbeam and birch the elevation is feet and many European genera not found about Dorjiling and belonging to the temperate Himalaya grow intermixed with tropical plants that are found no further north

 It is a remarkable fact that this hot damp gorge is never malarious this is attributable to the coolness of the river and to the water on the flats not stagnating for at Choongtam a march further north and feet higher fevers and ague prevail in summer on similar flats but which have been cleared of jungle and are therefore exposed to the sun

 It is hence quite unlike the forest clad mountains further south and indicates a drier and more sunny climate

 At feet the Abies Brunoniana is found a tree quite unknown further south but neither the larch nor the Albies Smithiana Khutrow accompanied it they being confined to still more northern regions

 The Singtam Soubah visited me daily and we enjoyed long friendly conversations he still insisted that the Yangchoo the name he gave to the Lachen at this place was the boundary and that I must not go any further

 In all matters respecting the frontier his lies were circumstantial and he further took the trouble of bringing country people to swear that this was Cheen and that there was no such place as Kongra Lama

 These are the most northern shrubs in Sikkim and I regarded them with deep interest as being possibly the last of their kind to be met with in this meridian for many degrees further north perhaps even no similar shrubs occur between this and the Siberian Altai a distance of miles

 Five miles further on we arrived at the tents of the Phipun whose wife was prepared to entertain us with Tartar hospitality magnificent tawny Tibet mastiffs were baying at the tent door and some yaks and ponies were grazing close by

 I remained here till the th of August Though degrees further north and feet above the level of Calcutta the mean temperature at Choongtam this month was only 

 I ascended over loose rocks to between and feet and reached vast masses of blue ribboned ice capping the ridges but obtained no further prospect

 Forty miles further north in Tibet the same line is probably at feet for there much less snow falls and much more melts in proportion

 Having sent the coolies forward with instructions to halt and camp on this side of the Kongra Lama pass we followed them taking the route by Palung and thence over the hills to the Lachen to the east of which we descended and further up its valley joined the advanced party in a rocky glen called Sitong an advantageous camping ground from being sheltered by rocks which ward off the keen blasts its elevation is feet above the sea and the magnificent west cliff of Kinchinjhow towers over it not a mile distant bearing due east and subtending an angle of 

 Beyond this I recognised a hill of which I had taken bearings from Donkia pass and a few miles further on rounding a great spur of Kinchinjunga I arrived in sight of Cholamoo lakes with the Donkia mountain rearing its stupendous precipices of rock and ice on the east

 The geese An enormous quantity of water fowl breed in Tibet including many Indian species that migrate no further north

 and consequent evaporation increased by the violent wind sufficiently accounts for the height of the snow line in further evidence of which I may add that a piece of ice or snow laid on the ground here does not melt but disappears by evaporation

 They proved to be of fossiliferous limestone the strata of which were much disturbed the strike appeared in one part north west and the dip north east degrees a large fault passed east by north through the cliff and it was further cleft by joints running northwards

 The next day we reached Rungpo where we halted for further instructions our tents were placed apart but we managed to correspond by stealth

 Campbell had been desired to attend the Durbar for the purpose of transacting business but had refused to go except by compulsion considering that in the excited state of the authorities amongst whom there was not one person of responsibility or judgment his presence would not only be useless but he might be exposed to further insult or possibly violence

 The particulars of our seizure and the reasons for it and for our further detention were unknown at Dorjiling or a very different line of policy would have been pursued

 The Dewan went on the th to a hot bath a few hundred feet down the hill he was led past our hut his burly frame tottering as if in great weakness but a more transparent fraud could not have been practised he was in fact lying on his oars pending further negotiations

 On the nd and rd December we had further conferences with the Dewan who said that we were to be taken to Dorjiling in six days with two Vakeels from the Rajah

 On the nd of December he marched us eight miles further to Cheadam on a bold spur feet high overlooking the Great Rungeet and facing Dorjiling from which it was only twenty miles distant

 It enabled me to survey the whole country and to execute a map of it and Campbell had further gained that knowledge of its resources which the British government should all along have possessed as the protector of the Rajah and his territories

 A large body of troops was however marched from Dorjiling and encamped on the north bank of the Great Rungeet for some weeks but after that period they were recalled without any further demonstration the Dewan remaining encamped the while on the Namtchi hill not three hours march above them

 To the inhabitants about souls this was a matter of congratulation for it only involved the payment of a small fixed tax in money to the treasury at Dorjiling instead of a fluctuating one in kind with service to the Rajah besides exempting them from further annoyance by the Dewan

 Since I left India these improvements have been still further carried out and now in the spring of I read of five splendid Victoria plants flowering at once with Euryale ferox white blue and red water lilies and white yellow and scarlet lotus rendering the tanks gorgeous sunk as their waters are in frames of green grass ornamented with clumps of Nipa fruticans and Phoenix paludosa

 I had seen both its native population and its European houses doubled in two years its salubrious climate its scenery and accessibility ensure it so rapid a further increase that it will become the most populous hill station in India

 degrees higher than at Calcutta which is miles further south

 Being at the head of the Gangetic delta which points from the Sunderbunds obliquely to the north west it is much damper than any locality further west as is evidenced by two kinds of Calamus palm abounding which do not ascend the Ganges beyond Monghyr

 This being the driest season of the year it is very probable that the mean level of the water at this part of the delta is not higher than that of the Bay of Bengal but as we advanced northwards towards the Khasia and entered the Soormah itself the atmospheric pressure increased further thus appearing to give the bed of that stream a depression of thirty five feet below the Bay of Bengal into which it flows This was no doubt the result of unequal atmospheric pressure at the two localities caused by the disturbance of the column of atmosphere by the Khasia mountains for in December of the same year thirty eight observations on the surface of the Soormah made its bed forty six feet above the Bay of Bengal whilst from twenty three observations on the Megna the pressure only differed 

 Large valleys enter the hills and are divided by hog backed spurs and it is far within these valleys that the waterfalls and precipices occur but the nearer and further cliffs being thrown by perspective into one range they seem to rise out of the Jheels so abruptly as to remind one of some precipitous island in the ocean

 It however forms further south at the very mouth of the Megna and is the effect of intense radiation when the thermometer in the shade falls to degrees

 of many kinds are very abundant and these hills further differ remarkably from those of Sikkim in the great number of species of grasses

 No rhododendron grows at Churra but several species occur a little further north there is but one pine P

 This fall is very local at Silhet not thirty miles further south it is under inches at Gowahatty north of the Khasia in Assam it is about and even on the hills twenty miles inland from Churra itself the fall is reduced to 

 Beyond Myrung the Khasia mountains slope to the southward in rolling loosely wooded hills but the spurs do not dip suddenly till beyond Nunklow eight miles further north

 This arrangement indicates that relation of the rivers to the masses of snow which I have dwelt upon in the Appendix and further tends to prove that the snowy mountains seen from the southward are not on the axis of a mountain chain and do not even indicate its position but that they are lofty meridional spurs which projecting southward catch the moist vapours become more deeply snowed and protect the dry loftier regions behind

 From Nunklow feet lower than Myrung they appear higher the western peak rising degrees minutes above the horizon whilst from Moflong miles further south and elevation feet the same is sunk degrees below the horizon

 It is further evident that these mountains have as far as can be estimated by angles fully feet of snow on them which would not be the case were the loftiest only feet high

 Further still to the extreme west is an immense low hog backed mass of snow with a small peak on it this bears north west both from Myrung and Nunklow subtending an angle of minutes from the former and minutes from the latter station

 Donkia if seen would be distant miles from the same spot in the Khasia and Kinchinjunga possibly they are visible by refraction from Chillong though even further from it

 The further we travel and the longer we study the more positive becomes the conviction that the part played by these great agents in sculpturing the surface of our planet is as yet but half recognised

 The smelting is very rudely carried on in charcoal fires blown by enormous double action bellows worked by two persons who stand on the machine raising the flaps with their hands and expanding them with their feet as shown in the cut further on

 I only saw however the skirts of the forest the mountains further east which I am told rise several thousand feet in limestone cliffs are doubtless richer in herbaceous plants

 Stainforth s house is upwards of degrees further north and feet more elevated

 Whether any further rise is caused by elevation from below is doubtful there is no direct evidence of it though slight earthquakes annually occur and even when they have not been felt the water of tanks has been seen to oscillate for three quarters of an hour without intermission from no discernible cause

 These islets which are often an acre in extent are composed of stratified mud they have perpendicular sides several feet high and convex surfaces owing to the tide washing away the earth from under their sides and they were further slipping seawards along the gently sloping mud beach

 The climate is very healthy which is not remarkable considering how closely it approximates in character to that of Silhet and other places in Eastern Bengal but very extraordinary if it be compared with Arracan only miles further south which is extremely unhealthy

 Large myrtaceous trees Eugenia are common and show a tendency to the Malayan flora which is further demonstrated by the abundance of Gurjun Dipterocarpus turbinatus 

 Newman and with considerable care they were in general accurate and always extremely well guarded and put up in the most portable form and that least likely to incur damage they were further frequently carefully compared by myself

 There is no break in this forest caused by rock precipices or cultivation some spurs project nearer and some valleys appear to retire further into the heart of the foremost great chain that shuts out all the country beyond

 of greater mean elevation further west introduced to show the maximum elevation of the Sikkim mountains Kinchinjunga feet being represented on it

 Passing on little will be precipitated on e whose elevation is the same as that of Sinchul but much at f feet where the current being further cooled has less capacity for holding vapour and is further exhausted

 I was therefore surprised to find no further register of the weather at Dorjiling than an insufficient one of the rain fall kept by the medical officer in charge of the station who in this as in all similar cases The government of India has gone to an immense expense and entailed a heavy duty upon its stationary medical officers in supplying them with sometimes admirable but more often very inaccurate meteorological instruments and requiring that daily registers be made and transmitted to Calcutta

 I have not added the boiling point observations which afford a further means of testing the accuracy of the barometric computations and which will be found in section J of this Appendix

 Further it is written that when man had found a wife who was in entire harmony with his nature he knew that there could be nothing in nature which could be more useful to him but that after he believed the beasts to be like himself he straightway began to imitate their emotions III xxvii

 Further as we know not anything among individual things which is more excellent than a man led by reason no man can better display the power of his skill and disposition than in so training men that they come at last to live under the dominion of their own reason

 Further harmony is often the result of fear but such harmony is insecure

 Further fear arises from infirmity of spirit and moreover belongs not to the exercise of reason the same is true of compassion though this latter seems to bear a certain resemblance to piety

 The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property on the contrary they have become too powerful for these conditions by which they are fettered and so soon as they overcome these fetters they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society endanger the existence of bourgeois property

 Altogether collisions between the classes of the old society further in many ways the course of development of the proletariat

 Further as we have already seen entire sections of the ruling classes are by the advance of industry precipitated into the proletariat or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence

 The Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and nationality

 Of course in the beginning this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property and on the conditions of bourgeois production by means of measures therefore which appear economically insufficient and untenable but which in the course of the movement outstrip themselves necessitate further inroads upon the old social order and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production

 Moreover the people of Baghdad hearing that Allah had blessed their King with issue decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom and the Emirs and Wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished King Omar bin al Nu uman joy of his son Zau al Makan and of his daughter Nuzhat al Zaman wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts and dealt largesse to all gentle and simple who were present

 So King Sharrkan alighted and tying his steed to one of the trees went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in Arabic and saying Now by the crush of the Messiah this is not well of you but whose utters a word I will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle FN He kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold a stream was gushing and flowing and antelopes at large were frisking and roving and wild cattle amid the pasture moving and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs even as a poet described it in these couplets Most beautiful is earth in budding bloom When lucid waters course through plain and wood No work but His th All great th All glorious Giver of all gifts Giver of all good And as Sharrkan considered the place he saw in it a Christian Monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon

 This was further reduced to miles each month which is the present test and there is danger lest even this utterly insufficient test be abolished

 The let the buyer beware maxim when translated into actual practice whether in law or business tends to translate itself further into the seller making his profit at the expense of the buyer instead of by a bargain which shall be to the profit of both

 If things went well the cattle would soon bed down and nothing further would occur until morning when there was a repetition of the work the wagon moving each day eight or ten miles to some appointed camping place

 When the camp was only just across the river two of the calves positively refused to go any further

 I was making my way along the edge of the bad lands northward from my lower ranch and was just crossing a plateau when five Indians rode up over the further rim

 Then I reached the open prairie and resumed my northward ride not being further molested

 I always endeavored to keep out of a quarrel until self respect forbade my making any further effort to avoid it and I very rarely had even the semblance of trouble

 The argument might have been applied still further

 When I started further to question him he accused me of a lack of humor in not appreciating that his statements were made in a jesting way and then announced that a Congressman making a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives was perhaps in a little different position from a witness on the witness stand a frank admission that he did not consider exactitude of statement necessary when he was speaking as a Congressman

 Finally he rose with great dignity and said that it was his constitutional right not to be questioned elsewhere as to what he said on the floor of the House of Representatives and accordingly he left the delighted committee to pursue its investigations without further aid from him

 He further stated that he had been cruelly called to account by me because he had been endeavoring to right a great wrong that the Civil Service Commission had committed but he never then or afterwards furnished any clue to the identity of that child of his fondest fancy the bright young man without a name

 A further very dark fact was that many of the men responsible for putting the law on the statute books in order to please one element of their constituents also connived at or even profited by the corrupt and partial non enforcement of the law in order to please another set of their constituents or to secure profit for themselves

 Keep Olympia until further orders

 The reference to keeping the Olympia until further orders was due to the fact that I had been notified that she would soon be recalled to the United States

 The people took no interest whatever in the army demagogues clamored against it and inadequate though it was in size insisted that it should be still further reduced

 I spoke to you there and gave instructions from General Sumner that the position was to be held and that there would be no further advance till further orders

 I knew of one such case where in a State campaign a big corporation which had many dealings with public officials frankly contributed in the neighborhood of a hundred thousand dollars to one campaign fund and fifty thousand dollars to the campaign fund of the other side and I believe made some further substantial contributions in the same ratio of two dollars to one side for every one dollar given to the other

 I secured a mass of labor legislation including the enactment of laws to increase the number of factory inspectors to create a Tenement House Commission whose findings resulted in further and excellent legislation to improve housing conditions to regulate and improve sweatshop labor to make the eight hour and prevailing rate of wages law effective to secure the genuine enforcement of the act relating to the hours of railway workers to compel railways to equip freight trains with air brakes to regulate the working hours of women and protect both women and children from dangerous machinery to enforce good scaffolding provisions for workmen on buildings to provide seats for the use of waitresses in hotels and restaurants to reduce the hours of labor for drug store clerks to provide for the registration of laborers for municipal employment

 I could only repeat what I had already said and after half an hour of futile argument I rose and said that nothing was to be gained by further talk and that I might as well go

 The Senator is very sorry but he will make no further opposition I never saw a bluff carried more resolutely through to the final limit

 Partridge and Hooker secured me against further effort to interfere with my handling of the executive departments

 I supposed that this closed the incident and that no further effort would be made to nominate me for the Vice Presidency

 There is a further and more immediate and practical end in view

 Suits were brought against all the officials whom we thought we could convict and the public complained bitterly that we did not bring further suits

 If in the next year or two the action of the Federal Government fails to achieve what it is now achieving then through the further action of the President and Congress it can be made entirely efficient

 It was necessary to use what law was already in existence and then further to supplement it by Executive action

 The bills made no further progress

 A further result was the appointment of thirty six State Conservation Commissions and on June of the National Conservation Commission

 A year later the second report of the Commission recommended still further changes and said The fundamental fact that characterizes the situation under the present land laws is this that the number of patents issued is increasing out of all proportion to the number of new homes

 The Tawney amendment to the Sundry Civil bill forbade the President to appoint any further Commissions unless specifically authorized by Congress to do so

 I was opposed both by the foolish radicals who desired to break up all big business with the impossible ideal of returning to mid nineteenth century industrial conditions and also by the great privileged interests themselves who used these ordinarily but sometimes not entirely well meaning stool pigeon progressives to further their own cause

 The bill went through without further difficulty

 They further informed me that as a matter of fact the policy of the company has been to decline to acquire more than sixty per cent of the steel properties and that this purpose has been persevered in for several years past with the object of preventing these accusations and as a matter of fact their proportion of steel properties has slightly decreased so that it is below this sixty per cent and the acquisition of the property in question will not raise it above sixty per cent

 They knew that the suffering among the miners was great they were confident that if order were kept and nothing further done by the Government they would win and they refused to consider that the public had any rights in the matter

 I would also instruct him to dispossess the operators and run the mines as a receiver until such time as the Commission might make its report and until I as President might issue further orders in view of this report

 Extreme though the attacks sometimes made upon me by the extreme labor organizations were they were not quite as extreme as the attacks made upon me by the head of the National Association of Manufacturers and as regards their attitude toward legislation I came to the conclusion toward the end of my term that the latter had actually gone further the wrong way than did the former and the former went a good distance also

 So far it had all resulted merely in conversation and the time had come when unless somebody was prepared to act with decision we would have to resign ourselves to at least half a century of further conversation

 Under these circumstances it had become a matter of imperative obligation that we should build it ourselves without further delay

 The United States had assumed in connection with the canal certain responsibilities not only to its own people but to the civilized world which imperatively demanded that there should be no further delay in beginning the work

 But after the treaty had been made the Colombia Government thought it had the matter in its own hands and the further thought equally wicked and foolish came into the heads of the people in control at Bogota that they would seize the French Company at the end of another year and take for themselves the forty million dollars which the United States had agreed to pay the Panama Canal Company

 This of course is proof positive that the Colombian dictator had used his Congress as a mere shield and a sham shield at that and it shows how utterly useless it would have been further to trust his good faith in the matter

 The refusal of Colombia properly to respond to our sincere and earnest efforts to come to an agreement or to pay heed to the many concessions we have made renders it in my judgment necessary that the United States should take immediate action on one of two lines either we should drop the Panama canal project and immediately begin work on the Nicaraguan canal or else we should purchase all the rights of the French company and without any further parley with Colombia enter upon the completion of the canal which the French company has begun

 From all the sources of information at hand I grew most strongly to believe that a further continuation of the struggle would be a very bad thing for Japan and an even worse thing for Russia

 Japan was already suffering terribly from the drain upon her men and especially upon her resources and had nothing further to gain from continuance of the struggle its continuance meant to her more loss than gain even if she were victorious

 There was no further difficulty about the money

 As President in Messages to Congress I repeatedly called the attention of that body and of the public to the inadequacy of the Anti Trust Law by itself to meet business conditions and secure justice to the people and to the further fact that it might if left unsupplemented by additional legislation work mischief with no compensating advantage and I urged as strongly as I knew how that the policy followed with relation to railways in connection with the Inter State Commerce Law should be followed by the National Government as regards all great business concerns and therefore that as a first step the powers of the Bureau of Corporations should be greatly enlarged or else that there should be created a Governmental board or commission with powers somewhat similar to those of the Inter State Commerce Commission but covering the whole field of inter State business exclusive of transportation which should by law be kept wholly separate from ordinary industrial business all common ownership of the industry and the railway being forbidden 

 I believed at the time that the facts in the case were as represented to me on behalf of the Steel Corporation and my further knowledge has convinced me that this was true

 I believed at the time that the representatives of the Steel Corporation told me the truth as to the change that would be worked in the percentage of the business which the proposed acquisition would give the Steel Corporation and further inquiry has convinced me that they did so

 Moreover it entirely fails to give the publicity which is one of the best by products of the system of control by administrative officials publicity which is not only good in itself but furnishes the data for whatever further action may be necessary

 At their head rode General Lannes and Murat the first easy to recognize by his bold bearing and soldierly manners the second by the same qualities and further by a striking elegance both of costume and equipments

 My brave Desaix he further said always wished to die thus and then added almost with tears in his eyes but ought death to have been so prompt to grant his wish There was not a soldier in our victorious army who did not share so just a sorrow

 I do not think that there was one word in allusion to these two events in the whole ceremony and to confuse still further the recollections of the Republicans the Emperor ordered that the festival should be celebrated on the th because that was Sunday and thus there would result no loss of time to the inhabitants of the capital

 The Emperor did not place his gun firmly to his shoulder and as he always had it heavily loaded and rammed never fired without making his arm black with bruises but I rubbed the injured place with eau de Cologne and he gave it no further thought

 Having obtained the life of her father and the liberty of her mother as I have just related she still further exerted herself to save their companions in misfortune who had been condemned to death and for this purpose joined the ladies of Brittany who had been led to seek her cooperation by the success of her former petitions and went with them to Malmaison to beg these additional pardons

 The whole column burst into shouts of laughter and no further request was made

 General O Reilly saved his life by having him carried away by his soldiers but the Archduke Maximilian in order to defy the Emperor still further paraded in triumph in the midst of the national guard the individual who has struck the first blow at the bearer of the French summons

 Besides all this I think that the exercise of hunting in moderation was very good for the Emperor s health for I never saw him in better condition than during the very time the English journals took pleasure in describing him as ill and perhaps by these false statements were contributing to still further improve his health

 Nothing further had occurred when a third and similar rendezvous was appointed at which the French officer presented himself with the same punctuality and inexhaustible patience

 I know very well that the matter would not have been permitted to continue thus without my interesting myself further in it but events followed each other in rapid succession until the abdication of his Majesty and the affair finally remained as thus settled

 Further I will not now dwell on this circumstance proposing in the following chapter to collect my souvenirs which relate more especially to the beginning of the campaign in France and some circumstances which preceded it

 The visit of this lady to Fontainebleau recalls another of almost the same kind but to describe which it is necessary that I take up the thread of events a little further back

 The director of the custom house not daring to proceed further sent to the director general a report to be submitted to the Emperor

 Filangieri godson of the queen of Naples had refused a regiment which the latter had offered him while he was still only a simple lieutenant in the Consular Guard and further because he had not consented to become a Neapolitan again until a French prince had been called to the throne of Naples

 Now he was in the pits of despondency even as one that yieldeth without further struggle to the waves of tempest at midnight when he was ware of one standing over him a woman old wrinkled a very crone with but room for the drawing of a thread between her nose and her chin she was as is cited of them who betray the doings of Time Wrinkled at the rind and overripe at the core and every part of her nodded and shook like a tree sapped by the waters and her joints were sharp as the hind legs of a grasshopper she was indeed one close wrecked upon the rocks of Time

 Then she said O youth pay me now a compliment Shibli Bagarag was at a loss what further to say to the old woman for his heart cursed her for her persecutions and ridiculed her for her vanities

 Then said he Fear no further thwacking but honour and prosperity in the place of it

 Then she wept and pulled her veil close murmuring Tis well They spake no further and pursued their journey toward the mountains and across the desert that was as a sea asleep in the blazing heat and the sun till his setting threw no shade upon the sands bigger than what was broad above them

 Almeryl stretched his arm to the lattice and drew it open letting in the soft night wind and the sound of the fountain and the bulbul and the beam of the stars and versed to her in the languor of deep love Whether we die or we live Matters it now no more Life has nought further to give Love is its crown and its core

 Say nothing of what thou hast seen or thou wilt shortly see nothing further to say my master

 Now by the Prophet and that interdict of his I ll drink no further

 So she faltered in sweetness knowing him doomed and loving to dally with him in her wickedness Indeed if thou cam st not for my kiss Then said the Vizier Yet a further guile Was t not an outrage to bring me here She faltered again leaning the fair length of her limbs on a couch Tis ill that we are not alone else could these lips convince thee well else indeed And the Vizier cried Chase then these intruders from us O thou sorceress and above all serpents in power for thou poisonest with a touch and the eye and the ear alike take in thy poisons greedily

 When they neared him he retreated in a further half circle and continued this wise wasting the fury of Mashalleed till he stood among his followers

 Surely the King bit his breath marvelling and his fury became an awful fear and he fell back from her molesting her no further

 So the Vizier replied He hath had thwackings yet is he not deterred from making further attempt on Shagpat

 When Khipil had paraded a short space he stopped quickly and said to Shahpesh Here is as it chanceth a gap O King and we can go no further this way

 How sayest thou O Feshnavat shall we devote ourselves to get possession of that Sword So the Vizier brightened at her words and said O excellent in wisdom and star of counsel speak further and as to the means

 So Shibli Bagarag dismounted and followed her up the hills and the rocks through ravines and gorges of the rocks and by tumbling torrents among hanging woods over perilous precipices where no sun hath pierced and the bones of travellers whiten in loneliness and they continued mounting upward by winding paths now closed in by coverts now upon open heights having great views and presently a mountain was disclosed to them green at the sides high up it and Noorna bin Noorka said to Shibli Bagarag Mount here for the cunning of this Ass can furnish him no excuse further for making thee food for the birds of prey

 When that is done bring him to me here where I await thee and I will advise thee further

 Ere Slubli Bagarag could question her further she embraced him and blew upon his eyes and he was blinded by her breath and saw not her departure groping for a seat on the rocks and thinking her still by him

 When she saw it gone her face waxed pale and she gazed slowly at all points muttering There is no further doubt but that I am under the eye of a man Thereupon she ran hastily from the vault and passed between the sentinels of the palace and saw them where they lay drowsy with intoxication so she knew that the China jar and the dress of Samarcand had been used that night and for no purpose friendly to her wishes

 Their words were brief and they wore each a terrible frown saying to him without further salutation Thrust in the flame of this furnace thy right wrist

 After awhile as Abarak still cried in his ear What sight he looked at him with a large eye saying querulously Is it written I shall be pushed by the shoulder through life And is it in the pursuit of further thwackings Abarak heeded him not crying still What sight and Shibli Bagarag lowered his tone and jerked his body pronouncing the name Rabesqurat Then Abarak exclaimed Tis as I weened

 So when he has failed in his attempt on Shagpat and blows fall plenteously upon him and he is regaled with the accustomed thwacking as I have tasted it in this undertaking do thou waste no further word on him for his part is over and as is said Waste not a word in enterprise Against or for the minute flies

 When they were gone Noorna exclaimed Now for the dish of pomegrante grain O Baba Mustapha and let nothing delay us further

 Luloo muttered Great is the Dispenser of our fates And she spake no further but sighed and took napkins and summoned the slave girls and arrayed Noorna silently in the robe of blue and bridal ornaments

 Wullahy twas wondrous and he went off again into a roll of cluckings and chucklings and exclamations of delight crying Need they further proof of the power in Shagpat now Has he not manifested it So true is that saying The friend that flattereth weakeneth at length It is the foe that calleth forth our strength

 Then came there that flash which is recorded in old traditions as the fourth of the flashes of thunderless lightnings after the passing of which hundreds of fakirs that had been awaiting it saw nothing further on this earth

 And all the time the star of these festivities was receding further and further and eclipsing himself with his reluctant serf Ripton who kept asking what they were to do and where they were going and how late it was in the day and suggesting that the lads of Lobourne would be calling out for them and Sir Austin requiring their presence without getting any attention paid to his misery or remonstrances

 At the hedge they parleyed a minute the farmer to inquire if they had had a mortal good tanning and were satisfied for when they wanted a further instalment of the same they were to come for it to Belthorpe Farm and there it was in pickle the boys meantime exploding in menaces and threats of vengeance on which the farmer contemptuously turned his back

 She peeped in further and further

 He listened for further enlightenment

 Money s safe I know said he now for the pology and Farmer Blaize thrust his legs further out and his head further back

 Further behind the scenes we observe Rizzio and Mary grown older much disenchanted she discrowned dishevelled he with gouty fingers on a greasy guitar

 The wise youth Adrian observed these further progressionary developments in his pupil soberly cynical

 Gradually too Richard apprehended that Ralph likewise was on the frontiers of the Realm of Mystery perhaps further toward it than he himself was and then as by a sympathetic stroke was revealed to him the wonderful beauty and depth of meaning in feminine names

 If he discovered anything further he said nothing but bade the good fellow good bye jumped into his boat and pulled down the tide

 The baronet smiled and said You study Heraldry too Are you fond of the science Ripton replied that he was very fond of it extremely attached and threw a further pile of papers into the dark corner

 Upon which she told him further that her young lady was an innocent artless creature who had been to school upwards of three years with the nuns and had a little money of her own and was beautiful enough to be a lord s lady and had been in love with Master Richard ever since she was a little girl

 Richard turned his back on further dialogue by going to the window

 Dread of being signalized as the Foolish Young Fellow prevented Richard from expostulating further

 And oh to have companionship with a seraph one must know a seraph s bliss and was not young Tom to be envied The smell of late clematis brought on the wind enwrapped him and went to his brain and threw a light over the old red brick house for he remembered where it grew and the winter rose tree and the jessamine and the passion flower the garden in front with the standard roses tended by her hands the long wall to the left striped by the branches of the cherry the peep of a further garden through the wall and then the orchard and the fields beyond the happy circle of her dwelling it flashed before his eyes while he looked on the darkness

 A maid rushed by Richard in the passage and slipped something into his grasp which fixed on it without further consciousness than that of touch

 At the fountain of your eyes he replied and drew the joy of new life from her blushes without incurring further debtor ship for a thing done

 Pretty legal morality gentlemen Algernon interjected Hippias adding And lay too The pair of uncles listened further to the fictitious dialogue well kept up on both sides and in the end desired a statement of the old lady s garrulous case Hippias offering to decide what her chances were in law and Algernon to give a common sense judgment

 Ah why should she doubt that his great love was the first law to her Why should she not believe that she would wreck him by resisting And if she suffered oh sweet to think it was for his sake Sweet to shut out wisdom accept total blindness and be led by him The hag Wisdom annoyed them little further

 The good creature required no further avowal of her secret but forthwith leaned her consummate bosom to the pillow and petitioned heaven to bless them both Then the little bride was alarmed and wondered how Mrs

 Berry racked her distracted wits for a further appeal

 For his patron had projected a journey commencing with Paris culminating on the Alps and lapsing in Rome a delightful journey to show Richard the highways of History and tear him from the risk of further ignoble fascinations that his spirit might be altogether bathed in freshness and revived

 How are we to distinguish the dark chief of the Manichaeans when he talks our own thoughts to us Further he whispered And your System if you would be brave to the world have courage to cast the dream of it out of you relinquish an impossible project see it as it is dead too good for men Ay muttered the baronet all who would save them perish on the Cross And so he sat nursing the devil

 A letter had awaited Adrian at the hotel which said Detain him till you hear further from me

 Disdain prevented any further notice of her

 He did not express the thing clearly nevertheless Ripton understood him to mean he intended to rescue that lady from further transgressions and show a certain scorn of the world

 Berry talked further of the fine woman

 John footman entered to clear the table and they were left without further interruption

 To her could she have seen it he gave further proofs of a real devotion in affecting and in her presence feeling nothing beyond a lively interest in her well being

 His father s further meditations as they stepped briskly to the Foreys gave poor ferry a character which one who lectures on matrimony and has kissed but three men in her life shrieks to hear the very title of

 Not of his own accord he pass that sweet young wife of his like a stranger this day Sir Austin I must beg you not to intrude further ma am

 Further I have no escape

 Further inquiries responded to in Adrian s figurative speech instructed Austin that the baronet was waiting for his son in a posture of statuesque offended paternity before he would receive his daughter in law and grandson

 Berry exhibited his legs for further proof desiring Austin s confirmation as to their being dumplings

 Berry had said Three cups I goes no further and Lucy had rejected the proffer of more tea when Austin who was in the thick of a Brazilian forest asked her if she was a good traveller

 Can you ask me I mean said the ungenerous woman your System will require no further sacrifices from either of them When he did answer it was to say I think her altogether a superior person

 Further she read Which is the coward among us He who sneers at the failings of Humanity Oh that is true How much I admire that cried the dark eyed dame as she beamed intellectual raptures

 Yes he was there Emilia slowly pursued controlling her inclination to question further

 There were flourishes that indicated a termination of the proceedings when another fellow was propelled in advance and he shuffling and ducking his head to the cries of Out wi it Jim and Where s your stomach came still further forward and showed a most obsequious grin

 Oh no I mean just now and languid with the burden of so full a heart she did not attempt to explain herself further though he said invitingly I thought I heard you humming Then he was seized with a desire to have the force of her spirit upon him for Brookfield was in view and with the sight of Brookfield the natural fascination waxed a shade fainter and he feared it might be going

 It searched him thoroughly enough to keep him from any further pledges in that direction propitious as the moment was while the moon slipped over banks of marble into fields of blue and all the midnight promised silence

 He made no further allusion to the place

 There was no further sign given

 Cornelia spoke further of Emilia and her delight in the visits of Mr

 London they contended could not further be put off and would come especially now that the season was dying

 Owing to the amiable dissension between the Copleys and the Tinleys each party called again giving the ladies of Brookfield further opportunity for studying one of the levels from which they had risen

 Of marriage there was no further word

 Her panting was ominous of a further explosion

 This would have been further strengthened by Mrs

 Of their father s health a few words were said of Emilia nothing further

 Marter the curate s call with a Gregorian chant doubts of his orthodoxy Cornelia s lonely walks and singular appetite the bills and so forth ending What is to be said further of her In return Adela s delight was to date each day from a different port to which catching the wind the party had sailed and there slept

 Braintop s spirited reply Not at all was corrected to She did not cry and further modified That is she called out sharply when I whistled an opera tune

 For If I am of worth who looks on me was her outcry and the darkness she had previously coveted fell with the strength of a mace on her forehead but the creature s heart struggled further and by and by in despite of her the pulses sprang a clear outlook on hope

 Take further credit for her manner

 How could it be possible that she was so very nice to the eye and Wilfrid had abandoned her The healthy spin of young new blood turned the wheels of her brain and then she thought Perhaps I am really growing handsome The maid said artfully of her hair If gentlemen could only see it down miss It s the longest and thickest and blackest I ever touched And so saying slid her fingers softly through it after the comb and thrilled the owner of that hair till soft thoughts made her bosom heave and then self love began to be sensibly awakened followed by self pity and some further form of what we understand as consciousness

 Because if she has outnumbered the years of a child she is no further advanced than a child owing to what she has to get rid of

 If he said we could lay hands on fifty pieces then distrust him God grant that this be not another pit for further fruitless bloodshed was the interjection standing in Georgiana s eyes and then she dropped them pensively while Merthyr recounted the patient schemes that had led to this hour the unuttered anxieties and the bursting hopes

 My brother s first thought is to further your progress in Art

 He was telling her that a further delay might keep them in London for a week and that he had sent for her mother to come to her

 Why should I prevent him Emilia doled out the question slowly and gave herself no further thought of replying to it

 She smiled saying I forgive seems such a strange thing for me to say and to convey any further meaning that might comfort him better than words could do she held on her smile

 All that has gone has been devoted to relieve your countrymen and further the interests he has nearest at heart

 As he had never visited London his opinion was considered the less weighty but as he advanced no further speech the sins and backslidings of the metropolis were strongly brought to mind by his condemnatory utterance

 She however decided to arrest further bloodshed by quitting the regiment

 They last and when we blonde ones cry or grow thin oh what objects we become There were some final affectionate words but no further explanations

 Fleming remained by the door and shut his mouth from a further word till he heard Rhoda s returning footstep

 In return sir favour me with your word of honour not to molest this gentleman any further

 The throbbing of his head stopped all further thought

 Further than this he had nothing to fear for no woman could fail to be overborne by the masculine force of his brain in an argument

 Further to inspirit him he met Jonathan Eccles who put the same question to him and getting the same answer turned sharp round and walked homeward

 Algernon listened to the prima donna in loathing he had so much to inquire about and so much to relate such a desire to torment and be comforted Before he could utter a word further the door opened and Major Waring appeared and he beheld Mrs

 Algernon had stopped his mouth on that point as well as concerning his acquaintance with Dahlia by immediately attempting to borrow further whenever Anthony led the way for a word in private

 He could think of no subterfuge menace was clearly useless and yet the idea of changeing one of the notes and for so infamous a creature caused pangs that helped him further to endure his dogging feet and filthy tongue

 He broke an unpleasant silence by asking What further My master has sent you his bill

 Lovell cast down her eyes and read without further comment

 Further Margaret I must speak did he act with your concurrence or knowledge of it at all in acting as he has done Heavens Percy you question me like a husband

 She argued to herself that misery which follows sin cannot surely afflict us further when we are penitent and seek to do right her thought being that perchance if she refrained from striving against the current and if she suffered her body to be borne along God would be the more merciful

 Algernon was employed in the comfortable degustation of his breakfast meditating whether he should transfer a further slice of ham or of Yorkshire pie to his plate or else have done with feeding and light a cigar when Edward appeared before him

 And further Thank you Robert

 But Dahlia was a soft creature without this apology for extravagance and what right had she to letters addressed to Miss Fleming The farmer prepared to ask a question and was further instigated to it by seeing Mrs

 I m not saying anything against him now the publican further observed

 Further relieved the diplomatist delivered a high opinion of the young gentleman his abilities and his conduct and trusted he should see him frequently

 A man of no station it was evident to the ladies at once and they would have taken no further notice of him had he not been seen stepping toward them in the rear of the young midshipman

 The landlady of the Aurora tavern was visited by none of these and with that beautiful trust which habit gives and which boastful love or vainer earthly qualities would fail in effecting she ordered that the pint of Madeira should stand from six o clock in the evening till seven a small monument of confidence in him who was at one instant the poor old dear at another the naughty old gad about further the faithless old good for nothing and again the blessed pet of the landlady s parlour alternately and indiscriminately apostrophized by herself her sister and daughter

 Harrington has taken spare me further remarks she said and Maria humbly flitted from her presence

 Before much further could be said between them the Countess de Saldar drove up

 Evan was placable enough but dogged he declined to make any admission though within himself he admitted that his antagonist was not in the position of an impostor which he for one honest word among them would be exposed as being and which a simple exercise of resolution to fly the place would save him from being further

 Evremonde wanted no further confession of her state

 And as a further provocation Evan would open his eyes

 Now to further Evan s love suit the Countess had induced Caroline to continue yet awhile in the Purgatory Beckley Court had become to her but Evan in speaking of Rose expressed a determination to leave her and Caroline caught at it

 He saw the star like figure up the length of it between the swelling tall dark pillars and was hurrying to her resolute not to let one minute of deception blacken further the soul that loved so true a soul

 Honestly now what with his dazzled state of mind his deep inward happiness and love s endless delusions he abstained from touching the subject further

 Having thus relieved his spleen the old gentleman addressed himself to further efforts and waxed hotter

 She said You must most distinctly give me your promise while this young adventurer remains here I think it will not be long not to be compromising yourself further as you now do

 It helped him further to accept herself otherwise could he his name known to be on a shop front have aspired to her still But as an unexampled man princely in soul as he felt why he might kneel to Rose Jocelyn

 Reproaching him further for his wastefulness Mrs

 Without any further exclamations Raikes acknowledged a superior

 That you are going to expose us What further exposure do we need I m sure Van my pride what I had is gone

 Nothing further passed between them

 She spared her the recital of facts further than the broad avowal

 She descanted further on spiritualism and on the balm that it was to tailors and their offspring to all outcasts from Society

 Do you see further Camilla s first song treats of a dream she has had of that mother

 The count chanced to allude further to the Signorina Vittoria

 Had Laura reserved this cunning turn a little further yielding to the natural temptation to increase the shock of the antithetical battery she would have betrayed herself but it came at the right moment the count gave up his arms

 You think that the dilettanti of Milan will have a delight to morrow night said Laura but seeing that the man s keen ear had caught note of the ironic reptile under the flower and unwilling to lose further time she interdicted his reply

 The accompaniments she objected to no further than a fish is agitated in escaping from the hook but Nein nein in her own language and No no in his burst from her lips whenever he attempted to transfer the fan to her keeping

 Then the signora questioned further

 At the maestro s door she thanked him for his escort and begged for it further within an hour

 She was applauded relishingly when after vainly wooing him she turned aside and said What change is this in one who like a reed Bent to my twisting hands Does he recoil Is this the hound whom I have used to feed With sops of vinegar and sops of oil Michiella s further communications to the audience make it known that she has allowed the progress toward the ceremonies of espousal between Camillo and Camilla in order at the last moment to show her power over the youth and to plunge the detested Camilla into shame and wretchedness

 To make it further telling he took off his yellow bonnet with a black gloved hand and thumped the significant colours prominently on his immense chest an idea not of Agostino s but Lebruno s own and Agostino cursed with fury

 He met Antonio Pericles and told him so adding for now the mask had been seen through and was useless any further that he had not had the heart to put back that vision of Camilla s mother to a later scene lest an interruption should come which would altogether preclude its being heard

 Luciano stipulated further that the soldiers were to be withdrawn

 They saw nothing further of her

 Now what do you say I say Weisspriess replied that if there s a further depreciation of the paper currency we shall none of us have much chance of digesting or assimilating either if I know at all what those processes mean

 An idea of disabling or dismembering Angelo and forwarding him to Meran caused him to trifle further with the edge of the blade

 Further the signora stated that Carlo might have to remain in prison

 She announced it with the simplicity of an independent woman of the world adding That is if my Wilfrid will oblige me by not plunging into further disgrace with the General

 His sensation of sinking was so vivid that he feared lest he should be going still further below

 They had no further visit from Barto Rizzo

 After appearing to weigh the matter he answered The umbrella will be of no further service to them to night

 The guns of Peschiera seemed to roam over the plain like an echo unwillingly aroused that seeks a hollow for its further sleep

 You are deserving of an effigy on a theatral grand stair case His gratitude could no further express itself

 I could have hanged Rinaldo Count Karl said further

 But the old friend of a young woman I need not say further than that it is different

 Vittoria and Agostino sat talking of the Chief and the minor events of the war of Luciano Marco Giulio and Ugo Corte till the conviction fastened on them that Carlo would not return when Agostino stood up and said yawning wearily I ll talk further to you my child tomorrow

 She proceeded to the point of business without further delay

 When he appeared he informed his mother that the Countess d Isorella would remain in the house that night and his mother passed out to her abhorred guest who for the time at least could not be doing further mischief

 While the duchess s stern under breath ran on hurriedly convincing Anna that she had with no further warning to fall back upon her uttermost strength the name of Countess Alessandra Ammiani was called at the door

 It seemed to whisper at times almost as it were Carlo s ghost breathing in her ears On thee On her the further duty devolved and she trod down hope lest it should build her up and bring a shock to surprise her fortitude she put back alarm

 The door slammed violently on such further speech as he had in him to utter

 Waddy got her hands at her sides and kept on gasping Oh sir oh while the Barber hurried away from the half shaved young man to consult his pretended astrolabe in the next room where we heard him shouting the sun s altitude and consulting its willingness for the impatient young man to be further shaved and back he came seeming refreshed to have learnt the sun s favourable opinion and gabbling at an immense rate full of barber s business

 Grinning at me Harry have I made a slip in my grammar eh Who could feel any further sensitiveness at his fits of irritation reading him as I did I saw through my aunt she was always in dread of a renewal of our conversation

 Ajax soon wore one of Janet s collars like two or three other of the Riversley dogs and I had the satisfaction of hearing Temple accept my grandfather s invitation for a further fortnight

 Not that she would not have expected it to be done by Germans further she was unable to explain her astonishment

 In this manner I also made the discovery that my father had no further supply of money none whatever

 The further she was flattered the faster she cried she had the face of an old setter with these hideous tears

 Affairs were no further advanced when I had to obey the squire s commands and return to Riversley missing the night of the grand ball with no profound regret except for my father s sake

 But my father desired them to postpone any further exposition of the case saying Pleasure first business by and by

 You see he has his pretty phrases cried the margravine adding encouragingly S il nest pas tant sort peu impertinent The advance of some German or Russian nobleman spared me further efforts

 Further I need not counsel a clever old son

 Julius unlike our modern Germans esteems women over men or it is a further stroke of his irony

 Further further He refused to dig at the mine within me and seemed to expect it to unbosom its riches by explosion

 I chanced to hear the margravine addressing Baroness Turckems say The princess s betrothal what further escaped me

 Three further months to bring the family round and the princess would be mine

 I had to repeat to her who my enemy was so that there should be no further mention of assassination

 The hours of my convalescence were furnished with food for amusement sufficient to sustain a year s blockade I had no further longing for society but I craved for fresh air intensely

 It became a question for me whether I should follow in the bitter track and further the question whether I could let them escape from sight

 We have won a princess And what England would say how England would look when on a further journey I brought my princess home entirely occupied his imagination to my excessive torture a state of mind for which it was impossible to ask his mercy

 Peterborough chuckled over this Oh and the stoppage of further questions while acknowledging that the luxury of a pipe would help to make him more charitable

 Peterborough commended me to gratitude for the imaginative and chivalrous element bestowed on me by a father that was other than a country squire one who could be tolerant of innocent habits and not of guilty ones a further glance at the interdicted pipe

 I would be off to London if I were you Harry for the purpose of checking my father s extravagances would have been the further wording which she spared me and I thanked her wishing at the same time that she would get the habit of using choicer phrases whenever there might by chance be a stress of emotion between us

 Otherwise I was spell bound and beyond interdicting any further public mention of my name or the princess s I did nothing to thwart him

 My grandfather I knew was too sincerely and punctiliously a gentleman in practical conduct to demand a further inspection of my accounts

 They permitted it for the purpose of battering me further

 She could not even make the man perceive that he was acting to use her poor dear old fashioned word reprehensibly in frightening the prince to further your interests

 I dared not unlink my arm for fear of further mischief

 I don t argue and I don t beseech any further I just sit on guard as I would over a powder cask

 Further than that you must question Providence which I humbly thank for its unfailing support down to unexpected trifles

 She murmured further and looked at Janet who came to her aid saying Grandada we ve had enough talk of money money All is done that you wanted done

 He seemed to me to be basely guilty of leading his victim on to expose himself further

 What sacrifice ma am What s the sacrifice I perceived that she could not without anguish and perhaps peril of a further exposure bring herself to speak and explained It relates to my having tried to persuade my father to marry a very wealthy lady so that he might produce the money on the day appointed

 If I he said this touchingly if I am any further in anybody s way it is only as a fallen tree

 But as a matter of serious obligation you would hold yourself bound by and by to perform them all I cannot speak any further of my willingness Harry

 She made it likewise appear that she was ready for further sacrifices to carry out the same

 Our interview satisfied my heart s hunger no further

 Temple did me a further wrong by almost thanking me on Janet s behalf for my sustained love for her while he praised the very qualities of pride and a spirited sense of obligation which had reduced her to dread my unforgivingness

 How the deuce to address it and what direction to write on it were further difficulties

 Her hands released how promptly might she not have been confiding her innumerable perplexities of sentiment and emotion to paper undermining self governance self respect perhaps Further than that she did not understand the feelings she struggled with nor had she any impulse to gaze on him the cause of her trouble who walked beside her brother below talking betweenwhiles in the night s grave undertones

 CHAPTER X A SINGULAR COUNCIL The four sat together under the shadow of the helmsman by whom they were regarded as voyagers in debate upon the question of some hours further on salt water

 And if so further observation assured her Miss Denham was likely to be dangerous far more than professedly attractive persons enchantresses and the rest

 Whether she had acted quite wisely in not remaining to see Nevil was an agitating question that had to be silenced by an appeal to her instincts of repulsion and a further appeal for justification of them to her imaginary sisterhood of gossips

 Culling concerning a lieutenant s shoulder decorations most gravely informing him of the anchor on the lieutenant s pair of epaulettes and the anchor and star on a commander s and the crown on a captain s with a well feigned solicitousness to save his uncle from blundering further

 As far as she could gather he fancied Nevil Beauchamp was in danger of something but he delivered his mind only upon circumstances and characters Nevil risked his luck Cecil knew his game Everard Romfrey was the staunchest of mankind Stukely had nothing further to say regarding the situation

 Further to quote Mr

 The democratic spirit inhabiting him temporarily or permanently asked whether they were not increasing to numbers which were oppressive And further whether it was good for the country the race ay the species that they should be so distinctly removed from the thousands who fought the grand and the grisly old battle with nature for bread of life

 Friend and foe were not further separable within her bosom than one tick from another of a clock they changed places and next his friend was fearing what his foe had feared they were inextricable

 No further mention was made of the miraculous vote which had risen responsive to the candidate s address of its own inspired motion so Beauchamp said I beg you to bear in mind that I request you not to plump

 Not a word further of the glove

 A further cause unknown to Mr

 Not a minute must be lost to prevent further mischief

 Further my dear colonel and Nevil marks it pretty much throughout This loyalty smacks of a terrible perfidy

 I shall be getting a democratic orator s twang or a crazy parson s if I go on much further

 So unless I have further orders from you I refrain from going

 Is one to rise at that hour to behold the effect And let me remind you further Nevil that the comparison of nature s minor work beside her mighty is an error if you will be poetical

 The prospect of her having to submit to a further interrogatory shut it up entrenched in the declaration that Dr

 Before breakfast was a further slur on Beauchamp

 Rosamund knew Lord Avonley too well to harass him with further petitions and explanations

 Subsequently he drove to his cousin Baskelett s Club where he left a short note to say the house was engaged for the night and perhaps a week further

 He pledged me his word to that effect solemnly he correctly felt that if the truth were known there would be further cause for the reprobation of the man who had been his host

 Phrase by phrase he fought through the first half of his composition of the reply against Lydiard yielding to him on a point or two of literary judgement only the more vehemently to maintain his ideas of discretion which were that he would not take shelter behind a single subterfuge that he would try this question nakedly though he should stand alone that he would stake his position on it and establish his right to speak his opinions and as for unseasonable times he protested it was the cry of a gorged middle class frightened of further action and making snug with compromise

 Silent she remained but Lord Romfrey was also silent and silence being a weapon of offence only when it is practised by one out of two she had to reflect whether in speaking no further she had finished her business

 Austin saying to him privately with no further reserve It s that fellow Beauchamp in the neighbourhood I m not so blind

 Let it be forgotten said Cecilia surprised and shaken to think that her situation required further explanations fascinated and unnerved by simply hearing him

 Nevil frankly told the doctor that he was not equal to it anything that was kind he was quite ready to say and anything that was pretty but nothing particularly kind and pretty occurred to him he was exactly like a juvenile correspondent facing a blank sheet of letter paper he really did not know what to say further than the uncomplicated exposition of his case that he wanted a wife and had found the very woman

 Further to add to the complexity he loved his liberty he was princelier free he had more subjects more slaves he ruled arrogantly in the world of women he was more himself

 I cannot help you one bit further

 Ought I not to be satisfied I am only I see further than most men and feel more deeply

 Further to quote from the same volume of The Book There is pain in the surrendering of that we are fain to relinquish

 That she a young lady maiden of strictest education should and without his teaching know that wives ran know that by running they compelled their husbands to abandon pursuit surrender possession and that she should suggest it of herself as a wife that she should speak of running His ideal the common male Egoist ideal of a waxwork sex would have been shocked to fragments had she spoken further to fill in the outlines of these awful interjections

 There could be no further doubt

 My arrangements are for staying here a further ten days in the terms of your hospitable invitation

 It seemed to him consequently politic to continue frigid and let her have a further taste of his shadow when it was his burning wish to strain her in his arms to a flatness provoking his compassion

 Doctor assured them she was at their service they protested that they had very few words to say and would not intrude one moment further than to speak them

 It would involve a day or two further disagreeable to you no doubt preferable to the present mode of escape as I think

 At the back of his mind there was a suspicion that his adversary would not have yielded so flatly without an assurance of practically triumphing secretly getting the better of him and it filled him with venom for a further bout at the next opportunity but as he had been sarcastic and mordant he had shown Clara what he could do in a way of speaking different from the lamentable cooing stuff gasps and feeble protestations to which he knew not how she reduced him

 Dr Middleton left it the more emphatic by saying nothing further

 Fearing lest she should proceed further and cut away from him his vantage ground of secrecy with her he turned the subject and was adroitly submissive

 Without designing to retort she instinctively grasped at a weapon of defence in further exalting his devotedness which reduced him to cast his head to the heavens and implore them to partially enlighten her

 He will be certain to out stroke you and you will be driven further than you meant to go

 A woman like Lady Busshe always prying for the lamentable would have required no further enlightenment

 Mountstuart spread the skirts of her voluminous dress remarking further At a certain age our teachers are young people we learn by looking backward

 For how carrying his tremendous load was he to compete with these unhandicapped men in the game of nonsense she had such a fondness for starting at a table He was further annoyed to hear Miss Eleanor and Miss Isabel Patterne agree together that caricature was the final word of the definition

 We are no further advanced than when we began observed Lady Busshe

 He speculated further on the witty and the dull

 Strange thoughts for a young head shot through her as that it is possible for the sense of duty to counteract distaste and that one may live a life apart from one s admirations and dislikes she owned the singular strength of Sir Willoughby in outwearying she asked herself how much she had gained by struggling every effort seemed to expend her spirit s force and rendered her less able to get the clear vision of her prospects as though it had sunk her deeper the contrary of her intention to make each further step confirm her liberty

 She was ready to expatiate on the gravity of her fault so long as the humiliation assisted to her disentanglement her snared nature in the toils would not permit her to reflect on it further

 His intuitive discretion taught him to fall back a step while she said So the plummet word of our mysterious deep fathoms and he fell back further saying Madam in a tone advising her to speak low

 And further suspicion fixed on Horace he knew not how except that The Book bids us be suspicious of those we hate as the man who had betrayed his recent dealings with Laetitia

 She could not chastise the kind ladies any further

 Corney who further recommended rest for Mr

 Further thinking of it she revived and recovered she despised the complication yet without perceiving how else he was to manifest himself legitimately in a dull modern world

 Further dissent rings out finely and approval is a feeble murmur a poor introduction of oneself

 The cry to supper conduced to a further insight of her adaptation to his requirements in a wife

 The likeness between them was she felt too flamingly keen to be looked at further

 In the morning she was a dried channel of tears no longer self pitiful careless of herself as she thought in other words unable any further to contend

 Incapable of that any further she leaned still in that direction and had a languid willingness to gain outward comfort

 And right thou more largely right he thought further advanced in it of the great Giuseppe the Genoese

 Deep eyes that give him in realms of light within light all that he has dreamed of rapturousness and blessedness you are threatened with a blinding kiss if you look abashed if her voice shall dare repeat another of those foolish self reproaches it shall be construed as a petition for further kisses

 He knew the contents of the letter and knew further that a copy of it with none of the pregnant syllables expunged had been forwarded to Prince Marko

 She had to yield up her breast to the truth and stimulate further unbelief lest her loaded heart should force her to run to the wounded lion s bedside and hear his reproaches

 GIVING GLIMPSES OF DIANA UNDER HER CLOUD BEFORE THE WORLD AND OF HER FURTHER APPRENTICESHIP XV

 It does not pretend to know the whole or naked body of the facts it knows enough for its furry dubiousness and excepting the sentimental of men a rocket headed horde ever at the heels of fair faces for ignition and up starring away at a hint of tearfulness excepting further by chance a solid champion man or some generous woman capable of faith in the pelted solitary of her sex our temporary world blows direct East on her shivering person

 Before further could be said the fair object of the dialogue came darting on a trip of little runs both hands out all her face one tender sparkle of a smile and her cry proved the quality of her blood Emmy Emmy my heart My dear Tony I should not have come but for the hope of seeing you here

 Redworth generally disagreed in opinion with Diana and contradicted her so flatly as to produce the impression of his not even sharing the popular admiration of her beauty and further she hoped for Diana to make a splendid marriage

 Sir Lukin further observed that he was a gentlemanly fellow

 She spoke of her husband as unlucky in railway ventures and of a household necessity for money nothing further

 Sir Lukin had gone to London early for further tidings

 He was bidden to come along if he wanted they Crassways and from the right they turned to the left and further sharp round and on to a turn where the old man otherwise incommunicative said There down thik theer road and a post in the middle

 Further walking brought them to a turn

 GIVING GLIMPSES OF DIANA UNDER HER CLOUD BEFORE THE WORLD AND OF HER FURTHER APPRENTICESHIP XV

 Redworth s further difficulties were confined to the hiring of a conveyance for the travellers and hot water bottles together with a postillion not addicted to drunkenness

 Except for this yes one thing further that I do rage at the ridicule and could choose but for you to have given the world cause to revile me or think me romantic

 And doubtless poor Sir Lukin had learnt his lesson still her defensive instincts could never quite slumber under his roof not because of any further fear that they would have to be summoned it was chiefly owing to the consequences of his treacherous foolishness

 CHAPTER XIV GIVING GLIMPSES OF DIANA UNDER HER CLOUD BEFORE THE WORLD AND OF HER FURTHER APPRENTICESHIP As the day of her trial became more closely calculable Diana s anticipated alarms receded with the deadening of her heart to meet the shock

 It is at a distance that striving countries should be seen if we would have them in the pure idea and this young woman of fervid mind a reader of public speeches and speculator on the tides of politics desirous further to feel herself rather more in the pure idea began to yearn for England long before her term of holiday exile had ended

 Yes and a married woman and a proclaimed one And notwithstanding those brassy facts he was ready to side with the evidence declaring her free from stain and further to swear that her blood was Diana s Nor had Dacier ever been particularly poetical about women

 He was however surprised to hear her tell Lady Esquart as soon as they were together at the breakfast table that he had the intention of starting for England and further surprised and slightly stung too when on the poor lady s moaning over her recollection of the midnight Bell and vowing she could not attempt to sleep another night in the place Diana declared her resolve to stay there one day longer with her maid and explore the neighbourhood for the wild flowers in which it abounded

 Nothing further was to be done for the book at that hour

 Warwick she had no wish to wound other than by stopping her further studies of the Young Minister and conducting him to the young lady loving him besides restoring a bereft husband to his own

 Arthur Rhodes was bidden to stretch his legs on a walk along the heights in the afternoon and Emma was further vexed by hearing Tony complain of Redworth s treatment of the lad whom he would not assist to any of the snug little posts he was notoriously able to dispense

 Percy s addiction to burlesque was a further hindrance for she did not perceive how her comedy could be strained to gratify it

 She cooled him further with eulogies of the chevaleresque manner of speaking which young Mr

 She must and without further hesitation be steeped that he might drag her out washed of the imputed defilement and radiant as she was in character

 When further it is a woman planted in a burning blush having to idealize her feminine weakness that she may not rebuke herself for grovelling the mean material acts by which she sustains a tottering position are speedily swallowed in the one pervading flame

 But as for your alarm check it and spare me further

 No she would have charged it upon the possession of brains by women and have had a further motive for inciting the potent dignitary her husband to employ his authority to repress the sex s exercise of those fell weapons hurtful alike to them and all coming near them

 She hung for a further proof of life in the motionless body

 Sir Lukin after some further remarks rode on and Redworth mused on a moral world that allows a woman of Mrs

 That Dacier never could have been the man for her would have compressed and subjected her and inflicted a further taste of bondage in marriage she was assured

 She dreaded Tony s refusal of the yoke and her iron hardness to the dearest of men proposing it and moreover her further to be apprehended holding to the refusal for the sake of consistency if it was once uttered

 Fenellan backed him further

 We hear and we see examples of sagacity and we are further brought round to the old confession that we cannot cook Colney Durance has us there we have not studied herbs and savours and so we are shocked backward step by step until we retreat precipitately into the nooks where waxen tapers carefully tended by writers on the Press light up mysterious images of our national selves for admiration

 And if you would like a further definition of Genius think of it as a form of swiftness

 And he well knew why his Nataly had her look of a closed vault threatening if opened to thunder upon Life when he dropped his further hints

 Burman s intentions he was aware that there was an obstacle to his being huggingly genial even candidly genial with her until he could deal out further news corroborative and consecutive to show the action of things as progressive

 A little further on he said Poor soul He confessed to himself that latterly he had he knew not why been impatient with her rancorous in thought as never before

 Since as he argued we cannot keep the poisonous matter out mothers should prepare and strengthen young women for the encounter with it by lifting the veil baring the world giving them knowledge to arm them for the fight they have to sustain and thereby preserve them further from the spiritual collapse which follows the nursing of a false ideal of our life in youth this being Colney said the prominent feminine disease of the time common to all our women that is all having leisure to shine in the sun or wave in the wind as flowers of the garden

 And see the long valley sweeps of the hanging meadows and maize and lower vineyards and central tall green spires Walking beside young Dudley conversing observing too Victor followed the trips and twists of a rill that was lured a little further down through scoops ducts and scaffolded channels to serve a wainwright

 Cormyn s and he imagined a hearing of his Fredi s Opera and her godmother s delight in it the once famed Sanfredini s consent to be the diva at a rehearsal and then her compelling her hidalgo duque to consent further an event not inconceivable

 Incidentally he named the sum his Fredi would convey to her husband with as was calculable the further amount his only child would inherit

 If it had been utter slave she phrased the words for a further reproach

 Further Nataly put on rather cravenly an air of distress or she half designingly permitted her trouble to be seen by way of affecting her girl s recollection when the confession was to come that Nesta might then understand her to have been restrained from speaking not evasive of her duty

 He spoke further

 He or some one having sanction from Victor might ultimately the ladies waiting anxiously in the next room to fold her on the warmth of their bosoms when she had heard impart to her the knowledge of circumstances which would under their further tuition concerning the particular sentiments of great families and the strict duties of the scions of the race help to account for and excuse the Hon

 Her maid Mary begged her to finish her breakfast Manton suggested the waiting a further two or three minutes

 But an image of the stricken and scattered mind of the man should though deficient in the attraction have a greater significance forasmuch as it does not exhibit him entirely liquefied and showered into space it leaves him his legs for the taking of further steps

 Dressed with his customary celerity he waited for Nesta to show her the lighted grand double drawing room a further proof of how Fortune favoured him she was to be told how he one day expressed a wish for greater space and was informed on the next that the neighbour house was being vacated and the day following he was in treaty for the purchase of it returning from Tyrol he found his place habitable

 Victor had his Nataly before him at a hint from Lady Grace and he went somewhat further than the exact degree when affirming that Nataly could not scheme and was incapable of suspecting

 Further he discovered in astonishment the subordination of all literary Americans to the decrees of their literary authorities marking a Transatlantic point of departure and contrasting ominously with the unruly Islanders grunting the higgledy piggledy of their various ways in all the porker s gut gamut at the rush to the trough

 Her ascent considering her inability to do further harm below was most mysteriously delayed

 Money Who wants money thundered the earl and jumped out of her trap of the further diversion from the plain request

 At midday of the third day Lady Charlotte was reduced to the condition of those fortresses which wave defiantly the flag but deliver no further shot awaiting the assault

 Morsfield or no Morsfield and now the poor wretch has got himself pinned to the plank like my grandson Bobby s dragonflies I don t want to say anything further of him she doesn t have much of a welcome at Steignton If I were a woman to wager as men do I d stake a thousand pounds to five on her never stepping across the threshold of Steignton

 Further corroboration was quite superfluous

 Well and she may learn the same or something sufficiently like it if she s caught in time called to her face Countess of Ormont sister in law and smoothed petted made believe she s now understood and won t be questioned on a single particular in fact she marches back in a sort of triumph and all the past in a cupboard locked up without further inquiry

 Aminta cried in the voice of tears I love the old so The likelihood is we shall hear nothing further

 He was alone disabled and cheerful in doubt of the arrival of succour before he could trust his left leg to do him further service unaided but it was morning still the sun was hot the air was cool just the tempering opposition to render existence pleasant as a piece of vegetation especially when there has been a question of your ceasing to exist and the view was of a sustaining sublimity of desolateness crag and snow overhead a gloomy vale below no life either of bird or herd a voiceless region where there had once been roars at the bowling of a hill from a mountain to the deep and the third flank of the mountain spoke of it in the silence

 He gave her the letter to read by herself while preparing to sit at table unwilling to ask her for a further tax on her energies but it was she who had spoken of going on He thought of it as of a debt she had contracted and might be supposed to think payable to their misfortune

 As a further instance might be cited the Ainu of Yezo and more doubtfully also some Bushman and Eskimo groups

 During that primitive phase of social development when the community is still habitually peaceable perhaps sedentary and without a developed system of individual ownership the efficiency of the individual can be shown chiefly and most consistently in some employment that goes to further the life of the group

 It has not been unusual for economic theory to speak of the further struggle for wealth on this new industrial basis as a competition for an increase of the comforts of life primarily for an increase of the physical comforts which the consumption of goods affords

 The motive that lies at the root of ownership is emulation and the same motive of emulation continues active in the further development of the institution to which it has given rise and in the development of all those features of the social structure which this institution of ownership touches

 Gradually as industrial activity further displaced predatory activity in the community s everyday life and in men s habits of thought accumulated property more and more replaces trophies of predatory exploit as the conventional exponent of prepotence and success

 By a further refinement wealth acquired passively by transmission from ancestors or other antecedents presently becomes even more honorific than wealth acquired by the possessor s own effort but this distinction belongs at a later stage in the evolution of the pecuniary culture and will be spoken of in its place

 This tabu on labour has a further consequence in the industrial differentiation of classes

 Beside and beyond these there is a further range of social facts which shade off from the region of learning into that of physical habit and dexterity

 But all the suggestions of a cumulative life of leisure and all the proficiency in decorum that comes by the way of passive habituation may be further improved upon by taking thought and assiduously acquiring the marks of honourable leisure and then carrying the exhibition of these adventitious marks of exemption from employment out in a strenuous and systematic discipline

 Plainly this is a point at which a diligent application of effort and expenditure may materially further the attainment of a decent proficiency in the leisure class properties

 Chapter Four Conspicuous Consumption In what has been said of the evolution of the vicarious leisure class and its differentiation from the general body of the working classes reference has been made to a further division of labour that between the different servant classes

 With a further advance in culture this tabu may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be a tabu or a larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily

 In a sense which has been greatly qualified in scope and rigour but which has by no means lost its meaning even yet this tradition says that the woman being a chattel should consume only what is necessary to her sustenance except so far as her further consumption contributes to the comfort or the good repute of her master

 It has served as the norm to which consumption has tended to conform and any appreciable departure from it is to be regarded as an aberrant form sure to be eliminated sooner or later in the further course of development

 As wealth accumulates the leisure class develops further in function and structure and there arises a differentiation within the class

 This topic need scarcely be pursued further here but the remark may not be out of place that all that considerable body of morals that clusters about the concept of an inviolable ownership is itself a psychological precipitate of the traditional meritoriousness of wealth

 The question is further complicated by the fact that many objects as for instance the precious stones and the metals and some other materials used for adornment and decoration owe their utility as items of conspicuous waste to an antecedent utility as objects of beauty

 By further habituation to an appreciative perception of the marks of expensiveness in goods and by habitually identifying beauty with reputability it comes about that a beautiful article which is not expensive is accounted not beautiful

 The mimicry it should be said extends further than to the sense of beauty in horseflesh simply

 As time has gone on each succeeding generation has received this tradition of meritorious expenditure from the generation before it and has in its turn further elaborated and fortified the traditional canon of pecuniary reputability in goods consumed until we have finally reached such a degree of conviction as to the unworthiness of all inexpensive things that we have no longer any misgivings in formulating the maxim Cheap and nasty

 As a further characteristic feature which fixes the economic place of artistic book making there is the fact that these more elegant books are at their best printed in limited editions

 Obviously if each garment is permitted to serve for but a brief term and if none of last season s apparel is carried over and made further use of during the present season the wasteful expenditure on dress is greatly increased

 The shaven face of the priest is a further item to the same effect

 So that the changing institutions in their turn make for a further selection of individuals endowed with the fittest temperament and a further adaptation of individual temperament and habits to the changing environment through the formation of new institutions

 The situation including the institutions in force at any given time will favor the survival and dominance of one type of character in preference to another and the type of man so selected to continue and to further elaborate the institutions handed down from the past will in some considerable measure shape these institutions in his own likeness

 The exigencies of the struggle for the means of life are less exacting for this class than for any other and as a consequence of this privileged position we should expect to find it one of the least responsive of the classes of society to the demands which the situation makes for a further growth of institutions and a readjustment to an altered industrial situation

 Under any known phase of culture other or later than the presumptive initial phase here spoken of the gifts of good nature equity and indiscriminate sympathy do not appreciably further the life of the individual

 Freedom from scruple from sympathy honesty and regard for life may within fairly wide limits he said to further the success of the individual in the pecuniary culture

 Along with these traits go certain others which have some value for the collective life process in the sense that they further the facility of life in the group

 In further qualification it is to be noted that the leisure class of today is recruited from those who have been successful in a pecuniary way and who therefore are presumably endowed with more than an even complement of the predatory traits

 The kinship of the two types of temperament is further shown in a proclivity to sport and gambling and a relish of aimless emulation

 Some details of this traditional scheme of life bearing on this point have been noticed in earlier chapters under the head of leisure and further details will be shown in later chapters

 From what has been said it appears that the leisure class life and the leisure class scheme of life should further the conservation of the barbarian temperament chiefly of the quasi peaceable or bourgeois variant but also in some measure of the predatory variant

 There is also a further range of facts that go to lessen class differences as regards the survival of the pecuniary virtues

 A further feature in which sports differ from the duel and similar disturbances of the peace is the peculiarity that they admit of other motives being assigned for them besides the impulses of exploit and ferocity

 In the most general economic terms these apologies are an effort to show that in spite of the logic of the thing sports do in fact further what may broadly be called workmanship

 For the purposes of economic theory these further barbarian traits may be taken as concomitant variations of that predaceous temper of which prowess is an expression

 As a further indication of their spiritual kinship it may be pointed out that the members of the lower delinquent class usually show this physiognomy of astuteness in a marked degree and that they very commonly show the same histrionic exaggeration of it that is often seen in the young candidate for athletic honors

 Betting on the issue of contests of strength and skill proceeds on a further motive without which the belief in luck would scarcely come in as a prominent feature of sporting life

 This further motive is the desire of the anticipated winner or the partisan of the anticipated winning side to heighten his side s ascendency at the cost of the loser

 The use of the term preternatural agency here carries no further implication as to the nature of the agency spoken of as preternatural

 These lay bodies are organized to further practical religion and as if to enforce the argument and firmly establish the close relationship between the sporting temperament and the archaic devoutness these lay religious bodies commonly devote some appreciable portion of their energies to the furtherance of athletic contests and similar games of chance and skill

 The grave economic significance of the anthropomorphic habit of mind and of the addiction to devout observances must serve as apology for speaking further on a topic which it can not but be distasteful to discuss at all as an economic phenomenon in a community so devout as ours

 That is to say they further the habits of thought characteristic of the regime of status

 In the case of fast days the conspicuous abstention from gainful occupations and from all pursuits that materially further human life is further accentuated by compulsory abstinence from such consumption as would conduce to the comfort or the fullness of life of the consumer

 They shade off by degrees from the genuinely sacred days through an intermediate class of semi sacred birthdays of kings and great men who have been in some measure canonized to the deliberately invented holiday set apart to further the good repute of some notable event or some striking fact to which it is intended to do honor or the good fame of which is felt to be in need of repair

 It is further to be noticed that the non conforming sects and variants whose priesthood is here under discussion vary among themselves in the degree of their conformity to the ideal scheme of sacerdotal life

 Many organizations charitable and ameliorative divide their attention between the devotional and the secular well being of the people whose interests they aim to further

 But something further is to be said with respect to the character of the disinterested motives and canons of procedure in all work of this class that is affected by the habits of thought characteristic of the pecuniary culture and this further consideration may lead to a further qualification of the conclusions already reached

 But the theoretical bearing is perhaps clear enough and may require no further illustration especially as some detailed attention will be given to one of these lines of enterprise the establishments for the higher learning in another connection

 But this predilection for the paraphernalia of learning goes also to indicate a further point of contact or of continuity between the priestly office and the office of the savant

 As further evidence of the close relation between the educational system and the cultural standards of the community it may be remarked that there is some tendency latterly to substitute the captain of industry in place of the priest as the head of seminaries of the higher learning

 The correlation of the two facts is probably clear without further elaboration

 After what has already been said in an earlier chapter on the sporting and gambling habit it is scarcely necessary further to discuss the economic value of this training in sports and in factional organization and activity

 Further as regards the direct participation of the members of the leisure class in the furtherance of knowledge the canons of reputable living act to throw such intellectual interest as seeks expression among the class on the side of classical and formal erudition rather than on the side of the sciences that bear some relation to the community s industrial life

 The question in hand is as to how far these branches of learning and the point of view for which they stand in the educational system help or hinder an efficient collective life under modern industrial circumstances how far they further a more facile adaptation to the economic situation of today

 On the other hand wherever I saw animal life in abundance as for instance on the lakes where scores of species and millions of individuals came together to rear their progeny in the colonies of rodents in the migrations of birds which took place at that time on a truly American scale along the Usuri and especially in a migration of fallow deer which I witnessed on the Amur and during which scores of thousands of these intelligent animals came together from an immense territory flying before the coming deep snow in order to cross the Amur where it is narrowest in all these scenes of animal life which passed before my eyes I saw Mutual Aid and Mutual Support carried on to an extent which made me suspect in it a feature of the greatest importance for the maintenance of life the preservation of each species and its further evolution

 This suggestion which was in reality nothing but a further development of the ideas expressed by Darwin himself in The Descent of Man seemed to me so correct and of so great an importance that since I became acquainted with it in I began to collect materials for further developing the idea which Kessler had only cursorily sketched in his lecture but had not lived to develop

 Or further down in the same article did he not tell us that as among animals so among primitive men the weakest and stupidest went to the wall while the toughest and shrewdest those who were best fitted to cope with their circumstances but not the best in another way survived

 If the numberless facts which can be brought forward to support this view are taken into account we may safely say that mutual aid is as much a law of animal life as mutual struggle but that as a factor of evolution it most probably has a far greater importance inasmuch as it favours the development of such habits and characters as insure the maintenance and further development of the species together with the greatest amount of welfare and enjoyment of life for the individual with the least waste of energy

 He pointed out how the need of leaving progeny necessarily brings animals together and the more the individuals keep together the more they mutually support each other and the more are the chances of the species for surviving as well as for making further progress in its intellectual development

 Further on on almost each wave a duck is rocking while higher up you notice the flocks of the Casarki ducks

 Further north in the Arctic archipelagoes you may sail along the coast for many miles and see all the ledges all the cliffs and corners of the mountain sides up to a height of from two to five hundred feet literally covered with sea birds whose white breasts show against the dark rocks as if the rocks were closely sprinkled with chalk specks

 In the far north the reindeer aggregate in numberless herds while still further north we find the herds of the musk oxen and numberless bands of polar foxes

 When I crossed the high plateau and its border ridge the Great Khingan on my way from Transbaikalia to Merghen and further travelled over the high prairies on my way to the Amur I could ascertain how thinly peopled with fallow deer these mostly uninhabited regions are

 Now when one imagines the immense territory almost as big as Great Britain from which the scattered groups of deer must have gathered for a migration which was undertaken under the pressure of exceptional circumstances and realizes the difficulties which had to be overcome before all the deer came to the common idea of crossing the Amur further south where it is narrowest one cannot but deeply admire the amount of sociability displayed by these intelligent animals

 And this of course appears with all possible gradations and with the greatest variety of individual and specific characters the very variety of aspects taken by social life being a consequence and for us a further proof of its generality

 That life in societies is the most powerful weapon in the struggle for life taken in its widest sense has been illustrated by several examples on the foregoing pages and could be illustrated by any amount of evidence if further evidence were required

 Those species which willingly or unwillingly abandon it are doomed to decay while those animals which know best how to combine have the greatest chances of survival and of further evolution although they may be inferior to others in each of the faculties enumerated by Darwin and Wallace save the intellectual faculty

 As to the intellectual faculty while every Darwinist will agree with Darwin that it is the most powerful arm in the struggle for life and the most powerful factor of further evolution he also will admit that intelligence is an eminently social faculty

 As to the young birds and mammals whom we continually see associating sympathy not love attains a further development in their associations

 It is in its turn a powerful factor of further evolution

 We also saw that though a good deal of warfare goes on between different classes of animals or different species or even different tribes of the same species peace and mutual support are the rule within the tribe or the species and that those species which best know how to combine and to avoid competition have the best chances of survival and of a further progressive development

 The first human societies simply were a further development of those societies which constitute the very essence of life of the higher animals

 As to the lake dwellings of Switzerland which represent a still further advance in civilization they yield still better evidence of life and work in societies

 Later on when desiccation rendered these territories more suitable for agriculture they were peopled with more civilized immigrants and while part of their previous inhabitants were assimilated by the new settlers another part migrated further and settled where we find them

 Such is Aleoute morality which might also be further illustrated by their tales and legends

 but that it was further developed by superstition and religion into the proportions it attained in Fiji or in Mexico

 It may often happen however that the retaliation goes further than the offence

 Therefore Darwin was quite right when he saw in man s social qualities the chief factor for his further evolution and Darwin s vulgarizers are entirely wrong when they maintain the contrary

 As to other species the very numbers of their bands always containing many males render the polygamous family more than doubtful further observation is evidently wanted

 share in the common land but also a union for common culture for mutual support in all possible forms for protection from violence and for a further development of knowledge national bonds and moral conceptions and every change in the judicial military educational or economical manners had to be decided at the folkmotes of the village the tribe or the confederation

 This institution again kept men together for a number of centuries permitting them to further develop their social institutions and to pass through some of the darkest periods of history without being dissolved into loose aggregations of families and individuals to make a further step in their evolution and to work out a number of secondary social institutions several of which have survived down to the present time

 We have now to follow the further developments of the same ever living tendency for mutual aid

 Droves of cattle iron which was extremely costly at that time and slaves were appropriated in this way and although most acquisitions were wasted on the spot in those glorious feasts of which epic poetry has so much to say still some part of the robbed riches was used for further enrichment

 And if one of the hirdmen of the armed brotherhoods offered the peasants some cattle for a fresh start some iron to make a plough if not the plough itself his protection from further raids and a number of years free from all obligations before they should begin to repay the contracted debt they settled upon the land

 They had covered the country with beautiful sumptuous buildings expressing the genius of free unions of free men unrivalled since for their beauty and expressiveness and they bequeathed to the following generations all the arts all the industries of which our present civilization with all its achievements and promises for the future is only a further development

 Only now when hundreds of guild statutes have been published and studied and their relationship to the Roman collegiae and the earlier unions in Greece and in India is known can we maintain with full confidence that these brotherhoods were but a further development of the same principles which we saw at work in the gens and the village community

 But this order of things takes us still further back in the history of trade namely to a time when trade in staple produce was carried on by the whole city and the merchants were only the commissioners the trustees of the city for selling the goods which it exported

 The immense economical progress realized by most italian cities just at the time when these wars were hottest and the alliances so easily concluded between towns still better characterize those struggles and further undermine the above theory

 But why did these centres of civilization which attempted to answer to deeply seated needs of human nature and were so full of life not live further on Why were they seized with senile debility in the sixteenth century and after having repulsed so many assaults from without and only borrowed new vigour from their interior struggles why did they finally succumb to both Various causes contributed to this effect some of them having their roots in the remote past while others originated in the mistakes committed by the cities themselves

 The above explanation seems to be the more probable but of course it must be tested by further research

 It was taught in the Universities and from the pulpit that the institutions in which men formerly used to embody their needs of mutual support could not be tolerated in a properly organized State that the State alone could represent the bonds of union between its subjects that federalism and particularism were the enemies of progress and the State was the only proper initiator of further development

 In our mutual relations every one of us has his moments of revolt against the fashionable individualistic creed of the day and actions in which men are guided by their mutual aid inclinations constitute so great a part of our daily intercourse that if a stop to such actions could be put all further ethical progress would be stopped at once

 These facts mostly neglected by sociologists and yet of the first importance for the life and further elevation of mankind we are now going to analyze beginning with the standing institutions of mutual support and passing next to those acts of mutual aid which have their origin in personal or social sympathies

 They indicate in which direction and in which form further progress must be expected

 And further on They were generally drawn in the same form commencing with the recital that the open and common fields lie dispersed in small pieces intermixed with each other and inconveniently situated that divers persons own parts of them and are entitled to rights of common on them

 And the need of mutual aid and support which had lately taken refuge in the narrow circle of the family or the slum neighbours in the village or the secret union of workers re asserts itself again even in our modern society and claims its rights to be as it always has been the chief leader towards further progress

 The animal species in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development are invariably the most numerous the most prosperous and the most open to further progress

 The mutual protection which is obtained in this case the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience the higher intellectual development and the further growth of sociable habits secure the maintenance of the species its extension and its further progressive evolution

 Going next over to man we found him living in clans and tribes at the very dawn of the stone age we saw a wide series of social institutions developed already in the lower savage stage in the clan and the tribe and we found that the earliest tribal customs and habits gave to mankind the embryo of all the institutions which made later on the leading aspects of further progress

 In regard to the practice of the game the lack of national chess spirit or organization and the extraordinary denominating influence of the foreign element is the remarkable and conspicuous characteristic and the modest seat assigned to British Masters in the Retrospects of and Times will it is feared have to be placed yet further back

 Its progress is further attested by the extreme favour in which Chess Tournaments both International and National are held at home and abroad which attract a degree of attention and awaken an interest little dreamt of during any past period of the history of the game and it is further illustrated by the continued formation of Chess Clubs in every sphere the ever widening interest in the home circle and by many other facts which indicate with absolute certainty its highly enhanced appreciation among the thoughtful and intelligent of all classes of the community

 More apt at figures than at diction I have no claim to powers of writing or learning which can afford me any hopes of doing full justice to so important a task as a worthy work on the history of chess would be my labours and experience however may have enabled me to gather together materials for a more solid and substantial chess structure than at present exists and I am not without confidence that competent and skilful workers will be found to construct an edifice more worthy of our day which present and pending grand developments will still further consolidate in interest and glory a building in fact cemented by the noblest and most worthy praiseworthy and commendable associations with which the aspiring and deserving artisan and mechanic of the present and future may be as closely identified as the greatest rulers deepest thinkers and most accomplished and profound scholars and distinguished men of science of the past affording also a substantial boon which may be conferred by philanthropists on their less fortunate brethren in society as it is calculated to induce temperate as well as peaceful and thoughtful habits

 Amant the French representative and all other players he encountered further enhanced British chess reputation by upholding his title against all comers until his wane and defeat by Anderssen of Breslau in the First International Tournament of a result quite unexpected at home and abroad but subsequent events confirmed what the character of Staunton s play in this competition seemed to indicate that he had passed his best for two English amateurs very young but rising into fame not then considered by any means equal in force to Staunton yet fully held their own in against Anderssen the first great German conqueror in games which Germany has ever held in very high estimation

 By a natural corruption of the pure Sanskrit word it was changed by the old Persians into Chatrang but the Arabs who soon after took possession of their country had neither the initial or final letter of that word in their alphabet and consequently altered it further into Shatranj which found its way presently into the modern Persian and at length into the dialects of India where the true derivation of the name is known only to the learned

 Trevanion had been more than satisfied with Vivian s performance he had been struck with it for though the corrections in the mere phraseology had been very limited they went beyond verbal amendments they suggested such words as improved the thoughts and besides that notable correction of an arithmetical error which Trevanion s mind was formed to over appreciate one or two brief annotations on the margin were boldly hazarded prompting some stronger link in a chain of reasoning or indicating the necessity for some further evidence in the assertion of a statement

 Why you could not betray yourself any further my dear Rodion Romanovitch

 We have gone further in our convictions

 You will admit that recollecting your embarrassment your eagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some time on the table and taking into consideration your social position and the habits associated with it I was so to say with horror and positively against my will compelled to entertain a suspicion a cruel but justifiable suspicion I will add further and repeat that in spite of my positive conviction I realise that I run a certain risk in making this accusation but as you see I could not let it pass

 I venture further to hope that this system will maintain the same unalterable character for the future

 It will require more firmness to remain undeterred by difficulty from within and opposition from without from endeavouring by a method quite opposed to all those hitherto followed to further the growth and fruitfulness of a science indispensable to human reason a science from which every branch it has borne may be cut away but whose roots remain indestructible

 The sphere of phenomena is the only sphere of their validity and if we venture out of this no further objective use can be made of them

 Space and time as conditions of the possibility of the presentation of objects to us are valid no further than for objects of sense consequently only for experience

 As we now proceed to the exposition of the employment of these I shall not designate the chapters in this manner any further

 For we have there seen that conceptions are quite impossible and utterly without signification unless either to them or at least to the elements of which they consist an object be given and that consequently they cannot possibly apply to objects as things in themselves without regard to the question whether and how these may be given to us and further that the only manner in which objects can be given to us is by means of the modification of our sensibility and finally that pure a priori conceptions in addition to the function of the understanding in the category must contain a priori formal conditions of sensibility of the internal sense namely which again contain the general condition under which alone the category can be applied to any object

 But as a sufficient criterion of truth it has no further utility or authority

 Now how happens it that to these representations we should set an object or that in addition to their subjective reality as modifications we should still further attribute to them a certain unknown objective reality It is clear that objective significancy cannot consist in a relation to another representation of that which we desire to term object for in that case the question again arises How does this other representation go out of itself and obtain objective significancy over and above the subjective which is proper to it as a determination of a state of mind If we try to discover what sort of new property the relation to an object gives to our subjective representations and what new importance they thereby receive we shall find that this relation has no other effect than that of rendering necessary the connection of our representations in a certain manner and of subjecting them to a rule and that conversely it is only because a certain order is necessary in the relations of time of our representations that objective significancy is ascribed to them

 We could never get further than proving that without this relation to conceptions we could not conceive the existence of the contingent that is could not a priori through the understanding cognize the existence of such a thing but it does not hence follow that this is also the condition of the possibility of the thing itself that is said to be contingent

 Thus the categories do in some measure really extend further than sensuous intuition inasmuch as they think objects in general without regard to the mode of sensibility in which these objects are given

 Nay further this conception is necessary to restrain sensuous intuition within the bounds of phenomena and thus to limit the objective validity of sensuous cognition for things in themselves which lie beyond its province are called noumena for the very purpose of indicating that this cognition does not extend its application to all that the understanding thinks

 Further by the addition of one affirmation reality to the other the positive therein is really augmented and nothing is abstracted or withdrawn from it hence the real in things cannot be in contradiction with or opposition to itself and so on

 But if we once have a completely and unconditionally given condition there is no further necessity in proceeding with the series for a conception of reason for the understanding takes of itself every step downward from the condition to the conditioned

 Very different is the case with the problem How far the regress which ascends from the given conditioned to the conditions must extend whether I can say It is a regress in infinitum or only in indefinitum and whether for example setting out from the human beings at present alive in the world I may ascend in the series of their ancestors in infinitum mr whether all that can be said is that so far as I have proceeded I have discovered no empirical ground for considering the series limited so that I am justified and indeed compelled to search for ancestors still further back although I am not obliged by the idea of reason to presuppose them

 In the second case I am justified only in saying that I can always proceed further in the regress because no member of the series

 Nothing further is necessary then for the solution of the first cosmological problem than to decide whether in the regress to the unconditioned quantity of the universe as regards space and time this never limited ascent ought to be called a regressus in infinitum or indefinitum

 But ideas are still further removed from objective reality than categories for no phenomenon can ever present them to the human mind in concreto

 But still further removed than the idea from objective reality is the Ideal by which term I understand the idea not in concreto but in individuo as an individual thing determinable or determined by the idea alone

 Thus it is properly the ontological argument which figures in the cosmological and constitutes the whole strength of the latter while the spurious basis of experience has been of no further use than to conduct us to the conception of absolute necessity being utterly insufficient to demonstrate the presence of this attribute in any determinate existence or thing

 The one says You must philosophize upon nature as if there existed a necessary primal basis of all existing things solely for the purpose of introducing systematic unity into your knowledge by pursuing an idea of this character a foundation which is arbitrarily admitted to be ultimate while the other warns you to consider no individual determination concerning the existence of things as such an ultimate foundation that is as absolutely necessary but to keep the way always open for further progress in the deduction and to treat every determination as determined by some other

 What means shall we employ to bridge the abyss After elevating ourselves to admiration of the magnitude of the power wisdom and other attributes of the author of the world and finding we can advance no further we leave the argument on empirical grounds and proceed to infer the contingency of the world from the order and conformity to aims that are observable in it

 But it will be asked further can I make any use of this conception and hypothesis in my investigations into the world and nature Yes for this very purpose was the idea established by reason as a fundamental basis

 It would be vain to philosophize upon the triangle that is to reflect on it discursively I should get no further than the definition with which I had been obliged to set out

 But that my ignorance is absolutely necessary and unavoidable and that it consequently absolves from the duty of all further investigation is a fact which cannot be made out upon empirical grounds from observation but upon critical grounds alone that is by a thoroughgoing investigation into the primary sources of cognition

 He denies with truth certain powers to the understanding but he goes further and declares it to be utterly inadequate to the a priori extension of knowledge although he has not fully examined all the powers which reside in the faculty and thus the fate which always overtakes scepticism meets him too

 When we are thus far advanced we need fear no further attacks for the limits of our domain are clearly marked out and we can make no claims nor become involved in any disputes regarding the region that lies beyond these limits

 But I ask do you require that that knowledge which concerns all men should transcend the common understanding and should only be revealed to you by philosophers The very circumstance which has called forth your censure is the best confirmation of the correctness of our previous assertions since it discloses what could not have been foreseen that Nature is not chargeable with any partial distribution of her gifts in those matters which concern all men without distinction and that in respect to the essential ends of human nature we cannot advance further with the help of the highest philosophy than under the guidance which nature has vouchsafed to the meanest understanding

 We others who were following crossed without accident but our further progress seemed doubtful for after a few more paces the same three dogs fell in again

 When we came to the place to which Hanssen and Bjaaland had carried their reconnaissance on the previous evening we had a very fine prospect of the further course of the glacier

 To continue along it was an impossibility it consisted here between the two vast mountains of nothing but crevasse after crevasse so huge and ugly that we were forced to conclude that our further advance that way was barred

 Our only chance lay in the direction of Don Pedro Christophersen here so far as we could see the connection of the glacier and the land offered possibilities of further progress

 To cross here did not look very inviting no doubt we could take the dogs out and haul the sledges over and thus manage it presuming the bridge held but our further progress which would have to be made on the glacier would apparently offer many surprises of an unpleasant kind

 What happens afterwards I don t know for further information apply to Wisting

 After we had held our course for some hours however the ice became so thick that it looked badly for our further progress

 About midday we went about and stood in towards land again immediately after came a violent squall which tore the outer jib to ribbons with that we were also obliged to take in the mainsail otherwise it would pretty soon have been caught aback and there would have been further damage to the rigging

 With the remaining sails any further attempt was useless there was nothing left but to get as close under the lee of the land as we could and try with the help of the engine to hold our own till the weather moderated

 One day he came and told us that he could no longer get at the coal and on further investigation it looked rather difficult

 It will thus be easily understood that this loss of warmth from the Gulf Stream must have a profound influence on the temperature of the air over a wide area we see how it comes about that warm currents like this are capable of rendering the climate of countries so much milder as is the case in Europe and we see further how comparatively slight variations in the temperature of the current from year to year must bring about considerable variations in the climate and how we must be in a position to predict these latter changes when the temperature of the currents becomes the object of extensive and continuous investigation

 Below metres fathoms the temperature further decreases everywhere in the South Atlantic at first rapidly to a depth between and metres 

 We see further in both sections and especially in the southern one that the isotherms and isohalins often have an undulating course since the conditions at one station may be different from those at the neighbouring stations

 It may be hoped that the further examination of the Fram material will make these matters clearer

 When the whole material has been further examined it will be seen whether it may also contribute to an understanding of the climatic conditions of the nearest countries where there is a large population and where in consequence a more accurate knowledge of the variations of climate will have more than a mere scientific interest

 Shakespeare had a finer conception of form but even he was contented to take all his ancient history from North s translation of Plutarch and dramatise his subject without further inquiry

 Indeed Jonson went further when he came to revise his plays for collected publication in his folio of he transferred the scene of Every Man in His Humour from Florence to London also converting Signior Lorenzo di Pazzi to Old Kno well Prospero to Master Welborn and Hesperida to Dame Kitely dwelling i the Old Jewry

 Further in agreeing to this they added that they would as willingly admit a committee of enquiry sent by any of the bourgeois governments actually at war with them

 Some months earlier I had got leave from the Bolsheviks to go into Russia to get further material for my history of the revolution but at the last moment there was opposition and it seemed likely that I should be refused permission

 I had no further difficulties

 My mind went further back to the March revolution and saw once more the picket fire of the revolutionaries at the corner that night when the remains of the Tzar s Government were still frantically printing proclamations ordering the people to go home at the very moment while they themselves were being besieged in the Admiralty

 Then it flung itself further back still to the day of the declaration of war when I saw this same square filled with people while the Tzar came out for a moment on the Palace balcony

 It had been found that the views of the Pyatakov government were further left than those of its supporters and so Pyatakov had given way to Rakovsky who was better able to conduct a more moderate policy

 He further read a statement by Right Social Revolutionaries delegates of that group members of the Constituent Assembly were in the gallery to the effect that they were prepared to help the Soviet Government as the only Government in Russia that was fighting against a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie

 Now he did not like it any better but he was very much afraid of war being brought into Russia or rather of the further disorders which war would cause

 That would be all true but you must look further

 Krestinsky believed that the revolution had gone so far that no further tax of this kind would be either possible or necessary

 Shaw he said was A good man fallen among Fabians and a great deal further left than his company

 Things have gone further there than in France if the news as to the extent of the strikes is true

 He wished the programme to include among other aims the further mechanization of production particularly the mechanization of all unpleasant and dirty processes improved sanitary inspection shortening of the working day in employments harmful to health forbidding women with child to do any but very light work and none at all for eight weeks before giving birth and for eight weeks afterwards forbidding overtime and so on

 Similarly until things are further developed than they are now we should be criminal slaves to theory if we did not in some cases allow lads under sixteen years old to be in the factories when we have not yet been able to provide the necessary schools where we would wish them to be

 Sukhanov Nikitsky agreeing believed that if the Bolsheviks came further to meet the other parties Mensheviks etc

 He was further convinced that intervention of any kind favoured reaction even supposing that the Allies did not wish this

 Their change of attitude towards the Soviet Government must not be attributed to any change in their own programme but to the realization that the forces which they imagined were supporting them were actually being used to support something a great deal further right

 He said further Intervention of any kind will prolong the regime of the Bolsheviks by compelling us to drop opposition to the Soviet Government although we do not like it and to support it because it is defending the revolution

 The first thing he said was I am afraid that the Jingoes in England and France will make use of yesterday s doings as an excuse for further action against us

 Civil war whatever happens is likely to be more bitter in the Ukraine than elsewhere because there the instinct of property has been further developed in the peasantry and the minority and majority will be more equal

 Further researches 

 The incredible and demonstrably fictitious legend of Leonardo s death in the arms of Francis the First is given with others by Vasari and further embellished by this odious comment Mostrava tuttavia quanto avea offeso Dio e gli uomini del mondo non avendo operato nell arte come si conveniva

 A further refutation may be found in the following sentence from the letter in which Melsi the young Milanese nobleman announces the Master s death to Leonardo s brothers Credo siate certificati della morte di Maestro Lionardo fratello vostro e mio quanto optimo padre per la cui morte sarebbe impossibile che io potesse esprimere il dolore che io ho preso e in mentre che queste mia membra si sosterranno insieme io possedero una perpetua infelicita e meritamente perche sviscerato et ardentissimo amore mi portava giornalmente

 But why should I enlarge further upon this What is there that could not be done by such a craftsman Almost nothing except to escape death

 And the side which faces the wind is always free from clouds and mists because the wind which is parted in beating on the rock closes again on the further side of that rock and in its motion carries with it the clouds from all quarters and leaves them where it strikes

 Perhaps your Excellency did not give further orders to Messer Gualtieri believing that I had money enough

 Nothing has hitherto been known of this journey but the significance of the passage will be easily understood by a reference to the following notes from which we may infer that Leonardo really had at the time plans for travelling further than Naples

 Casaubon when he came again But further reflection told her that she was presumptuous in demanding his attention to such a subject he would not disapprove of her occupying herself with it in leisure moments as other women expected to occupy themselves with their dress and embroidery would not forbid it when Dorothea felt rather ashamed as she detected herself in these speculations

 She attributed Dorothea s abstracted manner and the evidence of further crying since they had got home to the temper she had been in about Sir James Chettam and the buildings and was careful not to give further offence having once said what she wanted to say Celia had no disposition to recur to disagreeable subjects

 Dorothea s feelings had gathered to an avalanche and there could be no further preparation

 Casaubon she talked to him with more freedom than she had ever felt before even pouring out her joy at the thought of devoting herself to him and of learning how she might best share and further all his great ends

 Brooke I make a further remark perhaps less warranted by precedent namely that if he had foreknown his speech it might not have made any great difference

 I have contradicted it sir Fred answered with a touch of impatience not remembering that his uncle did not verbally discriminate contradicting from disproving though no one was further from confounding the two ideas than old Featherstone who often wondered that so many fools took his own assertions for proofs

 There was fascination in the hope that the two purposes would illuminate each other the careful observation and inference which was his daily work the use of the lens to further his judgment in special cases would further his thought as an instrument of larger inquiry

 Peacock s retirement without further recommendation than his own merits and such argument for solid professional acquirement as might be gathered from his having apparently wasted no time on other branches of knowledge

 In fact he had it in his thought to tell her that she ought not to have received young Ladislaw in his absence but he abstained partly from the sense that it would be ungracious to bring a new complaint in the moment of her penitent acknowledgment partly because he wanted to avoid further agitation of himself by speech and partly because he was too proud to betray that jealousy of disposition which was not so exhausted on his scholarly compeers that there was none to spare in other directions

 They both rose and there was never any further allusion between them to what had passed on this day

 Casaubon s statement that his labors in the Library would be suspended for a couple of days and that after a brief renewal he should have no further reason for staying in Rome encouraged Will to urge that Mrs

 Casaubon s patience held out further and when after all it turned out that the head of Saint Thomas Aquinas would be more perfect if another sitting could be had it was granted for the morrow

 Will had gone further than he intended and checked himself

 Casaubon and that gentleman expressing the best wishes for his cousin politely waived the pleasure of any further leave taking on the morrow which would be sufficiently crowded with the preparations for departure

 Casaubon had said I met him outside and we made our final adieux I believe saying this with the air and tone by which we imply that any subject whether private or public does not interest us enough to wish for a further remark upon it

 But he felt a little worried and wearied perhaps with mental debate and without waiting for the further gayeties of the horse fair he set out alone on his fourteen miles journey meaning to take it very quietly and keep his horse fresh

 From those visits to unsanitary Houndsley streets in search of Diamond he had brought back not only a bad bargain in horse flesh but the further misfortune of some ailment which for a day or two had deemed mere depression and headache but which got so much worse when he returned from his visit to Stone Court that going into the dining room he threw himself on the sofa and in answer to his mother s anxious question said I feel very ill I think you must send for Wrench

 He swallowed his ire for the moment but he afterwards wrote to decline further attendance in the case

 But there is a second will there is a further document

 At any rate the contrary issue must exclude you from further reception at my house

 Meanwhile Dorothea s mind was innocently at work towards the further embitterment of her husband dwelling with a sympathy that grew to agitation on what Will had told her about his parents and grandparents

 Her decision to go and her preoccupation in leaving the room had come from the sudden sense that there would be a sort of deception in her voluntarily allowing any further intercourse between herself and Will which she was unable to mention to her husband and already her errand in seeking Lydgate was a matter of concealment

 I mean she said after a moment s hesitation that the people in our village are tolerably comfortable and my mind has been too much taken up for me to inquire further

 Casaubon did not question her further but he felt sure that she had wished to know what had passed between Lydgate and himself She knows that I know said the ever restless voice within but that increase of tacit knowledge only thrust further off any confidence between them

 Will was banished further than ever for Mr

 He put out his hand to reach his hat implying that he did not mean to contend further and said still with some heat Well I can only say that I think Dorothea was sacrificed once because her friends were too careless

 There was no help for it now no reason for any further delay in the execution of necessary business

 Sir James was shy even with men about disagreeable subjects and the one thing that Dorothea would have chosen to say if she had spoken on the matter at all was forbidden to her at present because it seemed to be a further exposure of her husband s injustice

 He began not without some inward rage to think of going away from the neighborhood it would be impossible for him to show any further interest in Dorothea without subjecting himself to disagreeable imputations perhaps even in her mind which others might try to poison

 But it was at least clear that further objection was useless and Mr

 The lad s ankle was strained and he was in much pain from it but he was no further hurt and Fred placed him on the horse that he might ride to Yoddrell s and be taken care of there

 He had already narrated the adventure which had brought about Fred s sharing in his work but had kept back the further result

 She was determined to make no further resistance or suggestions

 I called to tell you not to go any further Mr

 The affair shall go no further

 I ordered Trumbull not to inquire further she said with a careful calmness which was evidently defensive

 He laid down the knife and fork with which he was carving and throwing himself back in his chair said at last with a cool irony in his tone May I ask when and why you did so When I knew that the Plymdales had taken a house I called to tell him not to mention ours to them and at the same time I told him not to let the affair go on any further

 I shall therefore in case of my ultimate decision to leave Middlemarch consider that I withdraw other support to the New Hospital than that which will subsist in the fact that I chiefly supplied the expenses of building it and have contributed further large sums to its successful working

 Casaubon say That was the further statement which I wished to make to you said Bulstrode who had thoroughly prepared his ministerial explanation

 Lydgate would be that instead of involving yourself in further obligations and continuing a doubtful struggle you should simply become a bankrupt

 But he made no further noise and Bulstrode setting down the candle awaited his recovery

 Some hours later when he was at home Caleb said to his wife incidentally that he had had some little differences with Bulstrode and that in consequence he had given up all notion of taking Stone Court and indeed had resigned doing further business for him

 Garth knew that this was a sign of his not intending to speak further on the subject

 Abel agreed with her husband that there was no knowing a proposition which had a great deal of mental food for her so that she shook her head over it without further speculation

 Unless there turn out to be further complications such as I have not at present detected yes said Lydgate

 Meanwhile I have pleasure in thinking that you will be released from further difficulty

 Abel and told her that he found himself unfit for further watching

 Nothing at present except the offer of the soup or the soda water you can come to me for further directions

 Dollop s speech had quite dried up and nullified his wits until they could be brought round again by further moisture

 as to the Hospital he avoided saying anything further to Lydgate fearing to manifest a too sudden change of plans immediately on the death of Raffles

 I recommend you at present as your clergyman and one who hopes for your reinstatement in respect to quit the room and avoid further hindrance to business

 But then came the question whether he should have acted in precisely the same way if he had not taken the money Certainly if Raffles had continued alive and susceptible of further treatment when he arrived and he had then imagined any disobedience to his orders on the part of Bulstrode he would have made a strict inquiry and if his conjecture had been verified he would have thrown up the case in spite of his recent heavy obligation

 Bulstrode meanwhile had been no further shaken by the oncoming tread of calamity than in the busier stirring of that secret uneasiness which had always been present in her since the last visit of Raffles to The Shrubs

 It had been his duty before taking further steps to reopen the subject with Mrs

 He had spoken to her in a way that made a phrase of common politeness difficult to utter and yet now that he had come to the point of going away from her without further speech he shrank from it as a brutality he felt checked and stultified in his anger

 Observing a change in Will s face he avoided any further mention of her feeling himself too ignorant of their relation to each other not to fear that his words might have some hidden painful bearing on it

 Alarmed at herself fearing some further betrayal of a change so marked in its occasion she rose and said in a low voice with undisguised anxiety I must go I have overtired myself

 He had found Lydgate for whom he had the sincerest respect under circumstances which claimed his thorough and frankly declared sympathy and the reason why in spite of that claim it would have been better for Will to have avoided all further intimacy or even contact with Lydgate was precisely of the kind to make such a course appear impossible

 Lydgate has virtually rejected any further service from me

 But no one stated exactly what else that was in her power she ought rather to have done not even Sir James Chettam who went no further than the negative prescription that she ought not to have married Will Ladislaw

 Come try the lad the mistress said Let him no further seek

 Then the old woman went away and the bride Sitt al Husn or the Lady of Beauty hight entered the inner part of the alcove broken hearted and saying in herself By Allah I will never yield my person to him no not even were he to take my life But as she came to the further end she saw Badr al Din Hasan and she said Dearling Art thou still sitting here By Allah I was wishing that thou wert my bridegroom or at least that thou and the hunchbacked horse groom were partners in me

 Now suppose I who have much of affairs wish to ship goods say to Newcastle or Durham or Harwich or Dover might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports I answered that certainly it would be most easy but that we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor so that the client simply placing himself in the hands of one man could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble

 Illustration WILLIAM GILMORE SIMMS He prospered financially married well became the owner of a fine estate and bent every effort to further southern literature and assist southern writers

 He further presents a vivid picture of the Georgia crackers and moonshiners but his inimitable animal stories and Uncle Remus who tells them have overshadowed all his other work and remain his most distinctive and original contribution to American literature

 In these masterpieces the reader is constantly delighted by the artist s skill which leads ever deeper into human motives after it would seem that the heart and mind could disclose no further secrets

 His Civil War experiences still further intensified this feeling

 He further concluded that it was unfitting for a democratic poet to be hampered by the verse forms of the Old World

 Further the constitution within the framework of which the ordinary process of administration and passing of decrees went on was always regarded as the work of a special man or body of men the lawgivers

 Further the belief that the constitution of a state is only the outward expression of the common aspirations and beliefs of its members explains the paramount political importance which Aristotle assigns to education

 From hence it is evident that such a state will not consist of a democracy and a monarchy and this will be further proved by what we shall say when we come particularly to consider this form of government

 And this proposal of his gives rise also to further conjectures and inquiries for some persons have doubted whether it is useful or hurtful to alter the established law of any country if even for the better for which reason one cannot immediately determine upon what he here says whether it is advantageous to alter the law or not

 Others carry the matter still further and inquire how many of his ancestors have been citizens as his grandfather great grandfather etc

 Though indeed some persons may have this further a doubt whether a citizen can be a citizen when he is illegally made as if an illegal citizen and one who is no citizen at all were in the same predicament but since we see some persons govern unjustly whom yet we admit to govern though not justly and the definition of a citizen is one who exercises certain offices for such a one we have defined a citizen to be it is evident that a citizen illegally created yet continues to be a citizen but whether justly or unjustly so belongs to the former inquiry

 If what is now said does not make this clear we will explain it still further if there should be any one a very excellent player on the flute but very deficient in family and beauty though each of them are more valuable endowments than a skill in music and excel this art in a higher degree than that player excels others yet the best flutes ought to be given to him for the superiority a in beauty and fortune should have a reference to the business in hand but these have none

 Nor are those things which we have already mentioned alone sufficient to describe these states for since there are many species both of a democracy and an oligarchy the matter requires further consideration as we cannot admit that if a few persons who are free possess the supreme power over the many who are not free that this government is a democracy as in Apollonia in Ionia and in Thera for in each of these cities the honours of the state belong to some few particular families who first founded the colonies

 And if those few who have large fortunes should acquire still greater power the oligarchy will then alter into one of the third sort for they will get all the offices of the state into their own hands by a law which directs the son to succeed upon the death of his father and after that when by means of their increasing wealth and powerful connections they extend still further their oppression a monarchical dynasty will directly succeed wherein men will be supreme and not the law and this is the fourth species of an oligarchy correspondent to the last mentioned class of democracies

 They ought however to take care and do this no longer than the common people are superior to the nobles and those of the middle rank and then stop for if they proceed still further they will make the state disorderly and the nobles will ill brook the power of the common people and be full of resentment against it which was the cause of an insurrection at Cyrene for a little evil is overlooked but when it becomes a great one it strikes the eye

 It also prevents the bodies of men from acquiring their full size if they marry before their growth is completed for this is the determinate period which prevents any further increase for which reason the proper time for a woman to marry is eighteen for a man thirty seven a little more or less for when they marry at that time their bodies are in perfection and they will also cease to have children at a proper time and moreover with respect to the succession of the children if they have them at the time which may reasonably be expected they will be just arriving into perfection when their parents are sinking down under the load of seventy years

 So that from this any one may suppose that it is necessary to instruct young persons in it for all those pleasures which are harmless are not only conducive to the final end of life but serve also as relaxations and as men are but rarely in the attainment of that final end they often cease from their labour and apply to amusement with no further view than to acquire the pleasure attending it

 What was it drove me to the poorest O Zarathustra Was it not my disgust at the richest At the culprits of riches with cold eyes and rank thoughts who pick up profit out of all kinds of rubbish at this rabble that stinketh to heaven At this gilded falsified populace whose fathers were pickpockets or carrion crows or rag pickers with wives compliant lewd and forgetful for they are all of them not far different from harlots Populace above populace below What are poor and rich at present That distinction did I unlearn then did I flee away further and ever further until I came to those kine

 And what happens Thus Spake Zarathustra is taken home the reader who perchance may know no more concerning Nietzsche than a magazine article has told him tries to read it and understanding less than half he reads probably never gets further than the second or third part and then only to feel convinced that Nietzsche himself was rather hazy as to what he was talking about

 He who can be proud of his enemies who can be grateful to them for the obstacles they have put in his way he who can regard his worst calamity as but the extra strain on the bow of his life which is to send the arrow of his longing even further than he could have hoped this man knows no revenge neither does he know despair he truly has found redemption and can turn on the worst in his life and even in himself and call it his best see Notes on Chapter LVII

 Even to call life activity or to define it further as the continuous adjustment of internal relations to external relations as Spencer has it Nietzsche characterises as a democratic idiosyncracy
