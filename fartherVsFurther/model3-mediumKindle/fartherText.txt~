 These breath runners or trance runners as they appeared to run in a trance would travel incredible distances nearly barefoot often with only straw sandals on their feet and were reported to travel farther and faster than horses

 As you run faster your arms naturally swing farther and farther

 In other words you go farther without additional effort

 With the same effort you go farther with each stride when you re on your toes

 Why Because going farther would generate immediate pain through the foot and up the leg like you I don t like pain and when I m running barefoot I m aware of pain and force with each and every stride

 As a general rule for cycling you might want to move your saddle farther forward perhaps a few millimeters each week to find a position that more readily duplicates your barefoot running position

 In general cyclists sit farther back than runners so to simulate running on your toes you need the saddle forward over the cranks or bottom bracket more

 In general the farther forward you are the closer you are to the bottom bracket and the more you need to raise your saddle

 These stretches are progressive therefore you should go slightly farther each time you do them yet never go to the point of pain or discomfort

 Because when you re barefoot you re going to be able to run farther and likely faster than ever before

 From there build up gradually venturing just a bit farther and slightly faster

 I just wish they d bring you closer to the ground rather than farther away from it and wish the lugs were farther forward as they stand it s more of a midfoot shoe than a true toe runner s shoe

 Did the officer stop the right car It is quite possible in heavy traffic for an officer to see a violation committed by one white minivan a Plymouth Voyager for example and to stop another an almost identical white Dodge Caravan farther down the road

 With so many similar looking cars it is possible that a cop could see a speeding car lose sight of it around a corner and then wrongly pick out your car farther down the road

 The Farther Back the Officer the Less Accurate the Pace For an accurate pace the officer must keep an equal distance between her car and your car for the entire time you are being paced

 Doing this correctly requires both training and good depth perception and it becomes more difficult the farther behind the officer is from your car

 This becomes more difficult the farther the officer is from either point

 The radar beam sends out billions of electronic pulses like peas per second and sends back reflected waves whose pulses are slightly farther apart

 More Than One Target Radar beams are similar to flashlight beams the farther the beam travels the more it spreads out

 You Stopped Farther Back 

 You Stopped Farther Back Most statutes say you must stop at the limit line crosswalk or entrance to the intersection

 Some conscientious drivers however stop farther back from the white marker line or crosswalk

 For example if you can show the collision occurred farther from the point where you entered an uncontrolled intersection than from where the other vehicle entered it that supports the idea that you were in the intersection longer or first

 In fact after glancing at my speedometer and seeing that I was going at the speed limit I was convinced the officer was speeding to an emergency farther down the road

 Do you also agree that the farther away an object is the more difficult it is to pace it If she says no ask her which is more accurate a pace at feet or a mile behind

 What tales of daring and adventure must earlier have been recounted as sailors and navigators practical men of the world gambled their lives on the mathematics of a scientist from Alexandria In Eratosthenes time globes were constructed portraying the Earth as viewed from space they were essentially correct in the well explored Mediterranean but became more and more inaccurate the farther they strayed from home

 In part this may be because the richness of our information declines rapidly the farther into the past we peer in the early history of our planet few organisms had hard parts and soft beings leave few fossil remains

 If they are moved ten times farther away the gravity is ten squared times smaller

 No gravity must decrease with distance which is why a comet or a planet moves slowly when far from the Sun and faster when close to the Sun the gravity it feels is weaker the farther from the Sun it is

 Because Mars is farther from the Sun than is the Earth its temperatures are considerably lower

 And so slowly and silently they rode some two leagues until they reached a valley that the ox driver thought would be a good place to rest and graze the oxen he communicated this to the priest but the barber said they should ride on a little farther because he knew that beyond a nearby rise was a valley that had more abundant and better grass than the one where the driver wanted to stop

 The valley beyond has another pass farther north meaning it s easy for clans to defend

 Farther down the pass Luke and Ben the former in white garments the latter in black were leaping side to side at the bottom of the pass dodging head sized rocks swirling around them

 Farther up the pass Luke and Ben were now moving in concert gesturing to turn back the reduced wave of flying boulders

 Farther down the pass Luke gestured as if making an upward palm strike against the empty air

 The three rancors were huddled farther down the pass licking their wounds

 All of a sudden they knew where their quarry was and she was in a sense farther away than ever

 As far as the church door he brought her and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four wheeler and out at the other

 Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner s dwelling

 It was evident that we had entirely miscalculated his movements that he had never been to his bedroom but that he had been sitting up in some smoking or billiard room in the farther wing of the house the windows of which we had not seen

 Yes but there is another empty house farther up the street which he must have passed before he came to this one

 You in that house Yes as far as the ground floor no farther

 In one of these windows he sat all day watching for Frederick who had gone farther up the road

 Ascertaining at his own door that his son had not yet come in but had been seen going farther up the hill he turned back again into the road and proceeded after him on foot

 But half way toward the house he stops the courage which has brought him so far suddenly fails and in one of those quick visions which sometimes visit men in extremity he foresees the astonishment which his emaciated figure is likely to cause in these two old friends and burying his face in his hands he stops and bitterly communes with himself before venturing farther

 And there higher up on the end of the shelf barren enough of ornaments God wot were a broken toy and a much defaced primer mementos likewise of his childhood and farther along the wall on a sort of raised bench a keg the spigot of which he was once guilty of turning on in his infantile longing for sweets only to find he could not turn it back again until all the floor was covered with molasses and his appetite for the forbidden gratified to the full

 As the dark settled his head fell farther and farther forward on the rail he was leaning against till he became to any passing eye but a blurred shadow mixing with other shadows equally immovable

 So he was no farther away from Sutherlandtown than that

 A crowd of guests rushed after her and as they followed her flying figure across the lawn to the small copse in which lay hidden this favored retreat they could hear borne back on the wind the wild protests of the young nurse that she had left the child for a minute only and then to go no farther than the bench running along the end of the bungalow facing the house that she had been told she could sit there and listen to the music but that she never would have left the child s side for a minute if she had not supposed she would hear her least stir protests which the mother scarcely seemed to heed and which were presently lost in the deep silence which fell on all as brought to a stand in the thick shrubbery surrounding the bungalow they saw the mother stagger up to the door look in and turn toward them with death in her face

 Yet when in full view of the bungalow s open door she stopped to point out to me the nearness of the place to that opening in the hedge we had just been making for and when she even went so far as to indicate the tangled little path by which that opening could be reached directly from the farther end of the bungalow I considered that my question had been answered though in another way than I anticipated even before I noted the slight flush which rose to her cheek under my earnest scrutiny

 But before I could gather up the reins a figure which I had not noticed before stepped from behind a tree at the farther end of the bridge and advancing into the middle of the road with arms thrown out stopped our advance

 As I came in view of the dock I saw that the men were still busy but at a point farther out in the river as if all hope had been abandoned of their discovering anything more inshore

 Ah came in a sort of muttered shriek from his lips as he pointed up here and there along the farther ceiling over which the light now played freely and fully

 The companion who had been with her had rushed in at the doorway and was gazing in sorrow and amazement at the white form lying outstretched and senseless against that farther wall

 But how to draw her attention to so insignificant a fact without incurring her ridicule I could not decide in our brief passage back to the bungalow and consequently was greatly relieved when upon opening the door and turning my lantern on the scene I discovered that in our absence the rug had torn itself still farther free from the floor and now lay with one of its corners well curled over the corner farthest from the door and nearest the divan where little Gwendolen had been lying when she was lifted and carried away where Mrs

 A couch to which some old cushions still clung stood against the farther wall

 As she had to approach the river by her own grounds and as she was obliged to choose a place sufficiently remote from the lights about the dock not to incur the risk of being detected in her hazardous attempt the shoe fell at a spot farther down stream than the searchers had yet reached and the intense excitement I had myself seen in Mrs

 No farther than that she asked anxiously

 But upon inspecting the floor I found it firm and convinced I should have to go farther for what I was seeking I hastily passed into the next room

 Whither wilt thou lead me speak I ll go no farther

 Leaving them where they stood face to face with the great hanging he made a dive for the pedestal towering aloft at the farther end and edging himself in behind it drew out the tapestry from the wall calling on them as he did so to come and look behind it

 Lee was on the farther side of one of the statues before her name had more than left his lips

 Having passed the Convent of St Martha and farther along that of Princess Joan the Saint they came upon vast stretches of olive groves here too vegetables were cultivated but in the absence of any natural springs to irrigate the land the problem was solved by the well sweeps which drew water in buckets tied to a long pole and by donkeys turning water wheels with their eyes blinkered so that they might imagine themselves to be moving in a straight line like their masters ignoring the fact that if they were really going in a straight line they would eventually finish up in the same place

 And she tells him That woman who is seated on the doorstep is carrying a male infant in her womb but the child has two strands of cord around its neck so it could either live or die I cannot be sure what will happen and this ground we are treading has a top surface of red clay and a layer of white sand underneath below the sand is gravel and farther down is granite right at the bottom is a huge cavity full of water with the skeleton of a fish bigger than me that old man who is passing also has an empty stomach and he s losing his sight and the young man staring at me has his penis wasted away by venereal disease and it oozes pus like a tap dripping water yet despite his infirmity he s always smiling his male vanity makes him go on staring and smiling at women in the street I hope that you suffer from no such vanity Baltasar and that you will avoid catching any disease and there goes a friar who has a solitary worm in his bowels which he has to nourish by eating enough for two but he would gorge himself even if he had no such worm and now observe those men and women kneeling before the Shrine of St Crispin you see them make the sign of the cross and strike their breasts and one another as an act of penance but what I see there are sackfuls of excrement and worms and a tumour that will end up strangling the man he doesn t know yet but tomorrow he will know and then as now it will be much too late for the tumour is incurable But how can I believe these things to be true when I cannot see them with my own eyes Baltasar asked her whereupon Blimunda told him Make a hole over there in the ground with your spike and you will unearth a silver coin Baltasar obeyed he made a hole in the ground and extracted a coin You were wrong Blimunda the coin is made of gold All the better for you I should not have ventured to make any guesses because I always confuse silver with gold nevertheless I did foretell that you would find a coin and that it would be precious what more can you ask when you have been told the truth and found something of value and if the Queen passed by this very minute I could tell you that she is pregnant again but it is still too early to verify whether it will be a boy or a girl my mother always used to say that the worst thing about the female womb is that when it has swollen once it has a tendency to go on swelling over and over again I can also tell you that the quarter of the moon has started to change because I can feel my eyes burning and there are yellow shadows passing before them like vermin crawling and extending their claws gnawing at my eyes for the love of God Baltasar I beg of you to take me home and give me something to eat and then lie down beside me walking ahead of you I cannot see you and I have no wish to see inside you I only want to look at you at that swarthy bearded face those tired eyes and that sad expression even when you lie at my side and make love to me take me home I shall walk behind you with my eyes lowered for I have sworn never to look inside you I shall keep that oath and deserve to be punished if I ever break my promise

 The Cardinal s procession includes a carriage that travels empty as a mark of personal esteem and another carriage for the steward and private secretary and the chaplain who carries the Cardinal s train when there is a train to be carried two open carriages of Spanish origin carry the chaplains and pages and in front of the litter are twelve footmen who together with all the coachmen and litter bearers add up to an impressive entourage and we must not forget the liveried servant who heads the procession with the silver mace it is indeed a happy populace that rejoices in such feasts and gathers in the streets to watch the nobility pass in procession as they accompany the Cardinal to the Royal Palace where Baltasar cannot enter to watch the ceremony but knowing the powers of Blimunda let us imagine that she is there we shall see the Cardinal moving forward between the guard of honour and as he enters the last of the audience chambers the King comes out to greet him and he gives him the holy water and in the next chamber the King kneels on a velvet cushion and the Cardinal on another and farther back in front of an ornate altar suitably decorated for the occasion one of the palace chaplains celebrates High Mass with all due pomp and ceremony and once the Mass is ended the Papal Legate takes the papal brief of nomination and hands it to the King who formally receives it before handing it back so that the Papal Legate may read it aloud this it should be said to conform with protocol not because the King is incapable of reading Latin and once the reading is over the King receives the Cardinal s biretta from the Papal Legate and places it on the Cardinal s head who is naturally overcome with Christian humility for these are onerous responsibilities for a poor man finding himself chosen to become one of God s intimates but the courtesies and reverences are not quite finished first the Cardinal goes off to change his vestments and when he reappears he is dressed all in red as befits his rank and is summoned once more into the presence of the King who stands beneath the ceremonial canopy twice the Cardinal puts on and then removes his biretta and the King goes through the same ritual with his hat and then repeating it a third time he steps forward four paces to embrace the Cardinal finally they both cover their heads and seated the one higher than the other they say a few words and their speeches made it is time for them to take their leave hats are raised and replaced the Cardinal however still has to pay his respects to the Queen in her apartments where he goes through the same ritual once more step by step until finally the Cardinal descends to the Royal Chapel where a Te Deum is about to be sung Praise be to God who has to endure such ceremonies

 We would see much more and much farther if we were to look from above for example and hover in the flying machine over this place called Mafra the much trodden mountain the familiar valley the Ilha da Madeira which the seasons have darkened with rain and sunshine and where some of the planking is already rotting on the felling of trees in the pine forest of Leiria and on the boundaries of Torres Vedras and Lisbon on the smoke fumes that rise day and night from the hundreds of furnaces of bricks and lime between Mafra and Cascais the ships that carry different bricks from the Algarve and from Entre Douro e Minho to be unloaded in the Tagus through a branching canal at the docks of Santo Ant nio do Tojal on the carts that transport these and other materials through Monte Achique and Pinheiro de Loures to His Majesty s convent and on those other carts which carry the stones from P ro Pinheiro there is no finer lookout than the one where we are now standing and we should have had no idea of the magnitude of the project at Mafra if Padre Bartolomeu Louren o had not invented his Passarola what supports us in mid air are the wills that Blimunda gathered into the metal globes down below other wills move around stuck to the globe of the earth by the laws of gravity and necessity if we were able to count the carts that travel back and forth along these routes from near and afar we would count up to twenty five hundred seen from up here they appear to be motionless such is the weight of their load

 The oxen farther up and farther down the road chewed their cud placidly watching the commotion the men running back and forth giving orders the inspector sitting astride the mule the faces of the men flushed and bathed in perspiration while the oxen stood there quietly awaiting their turn so tranquil that not even the ox goads resting against the yokes would stir

 Ludovice brought along his designs spread them out on the table and explained the layout in detail Here is the church to the north and south are the galleries and towers belonging to the Royal Palace and behind are the outbuildings of the convent which must now be extended even farther back in order to comply with Your Majesty s instructions here there is a mountain of solid rock which will be the last major operation in terms of mining and blasting and much work has already gone into excavating the base of the mountain and levelling the terrain

 A man might collapse foaming at the mouth after a sudden attack or perhaps simply topple over dragging with him to the ground the man in front and the one behind who panic when they find themselves shackled to a dead man a man might become ill without any warning in some remote place and be carried on a litter his arms and legs dangling over the sides only to die farther ahead and be hastily buried at the roadside with a wooden cross stuck into the ground near his head or if he is more fortunate he might receive the last rites in some village while the men sit around waiting for the priest to finish Hoc est enim corpus meum this body worn out by fatigue after marching all those leagues this body tormented by the chafing of ropes this body deprived of even the most frugal diet

 But whether farther ahead or farther behind in the procession Dom Jo o V will continue to keep him company as will the Queen and the Infantes the Prince and the Princess and all the powerful nobles who are making the journey

 The men who had come from the towns and villages between Vendas Novas and Montemor proceeded no farther

 These however are salvos of peace fireworks in the style of those illuminations and pyrotechnics one associates with feast days the King and Queen have now alighted from their coach the King wishes to proceed on foot from the city gates to the cathedral but the bitter cold rasps both hands and face so much that Dom Jo o V resigns himself to losing this first skirmish and climbs back into his coach that night he may well say a few sharp words to the Queen for it was she who refused to go any farther complaining of the chilly air when it would have given the King pleasure and satisfaction to stroll through the streets of Elvas on foot behind the cathedral chapter who awaited him with raised cross and the Holy Wood which was kissed but not accompanied Jo o V did not walk that via crucis

 Farther ahead as they made their descent to Cheleiros they saw a wooden cross at the roadside a clear sign that someone had died there probably the victim of a crime and whether this was the case or not one should always say a paternoster for the repose of the dead person s soul the friars and novices knelt down and prayed together God bless them for it is a supreme act of charity to pray for a person one does not even know and as they knelt there you could see the soles of their feet which were in such a pitiful state covered in blood and grime clearly the most vulnerable part of the human body and turned toward a heaven they would never tread

 Blimunda began to clamber up rapidly her strength comes rushing back she even starts running where the slope diminishes before becoming steep once more and farther ahead between two dwarf holm oaks she can barely perceive the track opened up by Baltasar on the successive journeys that will lead her to the Passarola

 Blimunda began to clamber up farther reproaching herself for not having thought of this sooner before the evening light began to dim

 You haven t by any chance seen a man around here with a hook strapped to the stump of his left arm Blimunda asked him Is he your husband Yes No I haven t seen him And you haven t seen a large bird flying over in that direction either yesterday or today No I haven t seen any large bird Well I d better be off then give me your blessing Father It s almost dark you might lose your way if you set out at this hour or be attacked by the wolves that prowl this region If I leave at once I should be able to reach the valley before dark It s much farther away than it looks from here listen near the convent stand the ruins of another convent which was never finished you can spend the night there and continue the search for your husband tomorrow No I must go As you wish but don t forget that I warned you of the dangers and with these words the friar started to climb back up the wide track

 Farther ahead it has actually stopped raining

 A little farther the rain starts up again

 Eyes accustomed to the dark see much farther

 The cortege disappeared around a corner almost certainly heading toward the Alto de Sao Jo o unless it took another turn farther on to the left in the direction of Benfica it was definitely not heading toward the Cemetery of Prazeres and what a pity for we are losing an edifying example of the equality bestowed by death O Mouraria lying side by side with Fernando Pessoa

 It is not far from here first you go up to the Rua do Alecrim as far as the church on the corner then you turn right then right again until you come to a cinema the Chiado Terrasse opposite the Teatro Sao Luis named after the King of France ideal places for enjoying the arts of stage and screen and the police headquarters is just a little farther on you cannot go astray

 Joseph decided You re in no condition to go any farther let s find an inn nearby tomorrow I ll go on to Bethlehem alone and explain that you re giving birth you can always register later if it s really necessary because I know nothing about Roman law and who can tell perhaps only the head of the family needs to register especially in our situation

 Mary is near collapse her body slumping farther forward over the saddlebags with each passing moment

 Mary has not much farther to go she still has to climb the fifteen semicircular steps leading to the Nicanor Gate also known as the Gate Beautiful but there she will stop because women are not permitted to enter the Court of the Israelites which lies beyond this gate

 WHEN THIS WAR ENDS AND IT WILL NOT BE LONG NOW for as we can see it is already almost over there will be a final reckoning of those who lost their lives so many here so many there some near some farther away and if it is true that with the passage of time the number of those killed in ambushes or open warfare loses all importance and is forgotten those crucified who number around two thousand according to the most reliable statistics will long be remembered by the people of Judaea and Galilee even after more wars have broken out and more blood has been spilled

 He had heard voices over the wall recognized the voice of his mother coming from farther away yet could not summon the courage simply to push the door open and announce I m here like one who knows his arrival is welcome and wishes to give a pleasant surprise

 One day he asked her if she had any relatives who might offer her shelter and she told him that her brother Lazarus and sister Martha lived in the village of Bethany in Judaea although she herself left home when she turned to prostitution and to spare them embarrassment she moved farther and farther away until she ended up in Magdala

 The sons of Zebedee warmed to this idea and after setting their boat on course began to row hoping that farther ahead there would be a breeze to help them on their way

 The mist allows Jesus to pass but his eyes can see no farther than the tip of the oars and the stern with its simple plank that serves as a bench

 The three of them set out early the next morning and knowing that John never stayed more than a few days in the same place and that they would most probably find him baptizing on the banks of the Jordan they went down from Bethany to a place called Bethabara at the edge of the Dead Sea intending to travel upriver as far as the Sea of Galilee and even farther north to the headwaters if necessary

 Then the Iberian peninsula moved a little farther one meter two meters just to test its strength

 Unless Micenae was a woman s name before it became that of a man like that celebrated Galician woman who gave her name to the town of Goleg in Portugal perhaps some Greeks from Mycenae in flight from the demented Atridae arrived in these remote parts and anxious to reestablish the name of their native region they happened to choose this place much farther away than Cerb re at the heart of hell and never so remote as now as we go sailing off

 The young girls are dressed in all their finery with mantillas and shawls and the elderly when they can walk no farther are carried by the young on their backs son you are father you will be you will reap as you have sown until some vehicle stops any vehicle and the journey goes on their weary limbs relaxed everyone making for the coast the beaches better still if they can find some elevation looking out to sea where they might be sure of a good view of that damned rock what a pity it s too far to hear the monkeys screeching disoriented because there s no land in sight

 Lyrical ecstatic the Spanish announcer declaims Look at the Portuguese all along their golden beaches once but no longer the prow of Europe for we have left the European quayside to sail once more the Atlantic waves what admiral will guide us what port awaits us the closing shot showed a young lad throwing a pebble into the sea practicing the art of ricochet one that requires no training and Joaquim Sassa said He has the strength of his years the stone couldn t possibly go any farther but the peninsula or whatever it might be appeared to be advancing with even greater vigor over the deep sea so different from what it normally is in the summer

 Jos Anai o suggested Let s eat a little farther down at Pa o de Arcos then we can go back to the hotel see how Pedro is Poor guy they nearly did him in

 Better not tempt Providence by attempting to go any farther down but send down unmanned machines instead equipped with film and television cameras sensors tactile and ultrasonic probes all the appropriate instruments for the job at hand

 When Deux Chevaux had to leave the highway farther ahead the number of pedestrians diminished only in proportion to the relative importance of the road

 Before they went to bed there was a council of war not that there was any immediate need for decisions those were left to the dog who was snoozing at Pedro Orce s feet but they speculated in turn Perhaps our journey ends here Joaquim Sassa said hopefully Or farther north Jos Anai o suggested thinking of something else I think it will be further north added Joana Carda who was thinking of the same thing but Pedro Orce was right when he told them The dog is the only one who knows whereupon he yawned and said I feel sleepy

 And the days on the road heading right toward a horizon that seemed to move farther and farther away

 Problems of some logistic complexity have yet to be resolved such as that posed by the important cities of Vigo Pontevedra Santiago de Compostela and La Coru a but as for the rest the people who live in villages are so accustomed to a precarious existence that almost without waiting for orders advice or information they have started retreating farther inland peaceful and resigned using the means of transport already described and others as well starting with the most primitive means of all their own feet

 The best solution actually would be deliberately to stir up panic to rush people into abandoning their homes and force them to seek refuge farther inland

 You can sense the terror growing like a black shadow the panic becomes a flood seeking out weak spots in the dike corroding the stone foundations until they finally give way and those who so far had remained more or less peacefully in their camps began to move farther eastward now realizing that they were far too close to the coast only some seventy or eighty kilometers away they could visualize the islands tearing through the land as far as where they were and the sea inundating everything the mountain on the island of Pico like some ghostly presence Who knows perhaps with the impact the volcano will become active once more But there is no volcano on Pico but no one listened to this or any other explanation

 It became necessary to circulate the cruel hypothesis that the peninsula might revert to its original route now a little farther north

 Farther ahead after passing Gasteiz they will return on to the roads that serve the smaller villages there the wagon will be in its element a cart drawn by horses on a country road rather than this unusual and startling exhibition of dawdling along a road designed for high speeds this lazy trot at fifteen kilometers an hour provided they are not going uphill and provided the animals are in a good mood

 They had gone there to sell their wares they bought some provisions renewed their supply of water and returned to the road still early But they did not get far stopping a little farther on at a small country church known as Turruchel a pleasant spot to spend the night

 When the wagon could go no farther the three men removed the corpse

 The papers pertaining to those no longer alive are to be found in a more or less organised state in the rear of the building the back wall of which from time to time has to be demolished and rebuilt some yards farther on as a consequence of the unstoppable rise in the number of the deceased

 Despite the difficulty with the back wall mentioned above the foresight of the original architects of the Central Registry is worthy of the highest praise for they proposed and defended in opposition to the conservative opinions of certain mean minded reactionary individuals the installation of five massive floor to ceiling shelves placed immediately behind the clerks the central bank of shelves being set farther back one end almost touching the Registrar s large chair the ends of the two sets of shelves along the side walls nearly flush with the counter and the other two located so to speak amidships

 Considered monumental and superhuman by everyone who sees them these constructions extend far into the interior of the building farther than the eye can see and at a certain point darkness takes over the lights being turned on only when file has to be consulted

 The dead or rather their papers are located still farther inside in somewhat worse conditions than respect should allow which is why it is so difficult to find anything when a relative a notary or some agent of the law comes to the Central Registry to request certificates or copies of documents from other eras

 He left the office and two doors farther along he finally found the head teachers study

 This one does not have furious drooling jaws it does not snort smoke and fire through its nostrils it does not roar loud as any earthquake it is simply a waiting stagnant darkness thick and silent as the ocean deeps there are reputedly brave people who would not have the courage to go any farther some would even run away at once terrified fearful that the obscene beast would grab them round the throat with its claws

 As we have already explained from time to time when the congestion caused by the continual and irresistible accumulation of the dead begins to block the path of staff along the corridors and consequently to obstruct any documentary research they have no option but to demolish the wall at the rear and rebuild it a few yards farther back However through an involuntary oversight on our part we failed to mention the two perverse effects of this congestion

 He would go in to the Central Registry and in less than a minute he would have checked the old lady s card by now the two cleaning ladies must have finished their work not that it takes them long they just empty the wastepaper bins sweep and lightly mop the floor as far as the shelf just behind the Registrar s desk it s impossible to persuade them with kind words or cruel to go any farther they re afraid they wouldn t be caught dead in there they say they too are of the kind who content themselves with appearances that s just the way they are

 The woman reached out her hand held the card close to her eyes then moved it farther off mumbling My glasses but she didn t go and look for them she knew they wouldn t help even if she wanted to she wouldn t be able to read what was written there her tears were blurring the words

 At first it was surrounded by a wall and for generations whenever the pressure inside began to hinder both the orderly accommodation of the dead and the free circulation of the living they did the same as in the Central Registry they would demolish the walls and rebuild them a little farther on

 Although he was even farther away this time Senhor Jos could see by the nod the deputy gave and by the movement of his Hps that he was going to be allowed to use the inner door

 If the shades of dusk caught up with him before he had reached the unknown woman s grave if night came to cut off all paths back sowing them with invisible terrors and preventing him from going any farther he could lie down on one of these mossy stones with a sad stone angel to watch over his sleep and wait for the birth of the new day

 Or else he could shelter beneath a flying buttress like that one over there thought Senhor Jos but then it occurred to him that farther on he wouldn t find any flying buttresses

 It was at that point that the ceiling without there being any apparent connection direct or indirect with what it had just heard emerged from its indifference to remind him There are at least three people you haven t spoken to yet Who asked SenhorJos Her parents and her ex husband It wouldn t be a bad idea to go and talk to her parents I thought of doing that earlier on but I decided to leave it for another occasion If you don t do it now you never will meanwhile you can divert yourself by going a little farther down this road before you finally bump your nose against the wall If you weren t a ceiling stuck up there all the time you would know that it has not been a diverting experience But it has been a diversion What s the difference Go and look it up in the dictionary that s what they re there for I was just asking everyone knows that a diversion is not the same as something being diverting What about the other one What other one The ex husband he would probably be the person who could tell you most about your unknown woman I imagine that married life a life lived in common must be like a sort of magnifying glass I can t imagine any reserve or secret that could resist the microscope of continual observation On the other hand there are those who say that the more you look the less you see but whatever the truth of the matter I don t think it s worth going to talk to him You re afraid he ll start talking about the reasons for the divorce you don t want to hear anything bad about her People on the whole are rarely fair not to themselves or to other people and he would more than likely tell me the story so that it looked as if he had been in the right all along An intelligent analysis I m not stupid No you re not it s just that you take a long time to understand things especially simple things For example That there was no reason why you should go looking for this woman unless Unless what Unless you were doing it out of love Only a ceiling would come up with such an absurd idea I believe I ve told you on another occasion that the ceilings of houses are the multiple eye of God I don t remember I may not have said it in those precise words but I m saying it now Tell me then how I could possibly love a woman I didn t even know and whom I d never even seen That s a good question there s no doubt about it but only you can answer it The idea doesn t have a leg to stand on It doesn t matter whether it s got legs or not I m talking about quite another part of the anatomy the heart the thing that people say is the engine and seat of affections I repeat that I could not possibly love a woman I didn t know whom I never saw except in some old photos You wanted to see her you wanted to know her and that whether you like it or not is love These are the imaginings of a ceiling They re your imaginings a man s imaginings not mine You re so arrogant you think you know everything about me I don t know everything but I must have learned a thing or two after all these years of living together I bet you ve never considered that you and I live together the great difference between us is that you only notice me when you need advice and cast your eyes upwards while I spend all my time looking at you The eye of God You can take my metaphors seriously if you like but don t repeat them as if they were yours

 The solution to the problem quite brilliant as the police themselves privately acknowledged consisted in dividing the assailants into two groups one tactical the other strategic and in erecting two barriers instead of one the tactical group swiftly blocking the road after one sufficiently isolated truck had passed and the strategic group a few hundred meters farther up the road and informed of this action by the predetermined signal of a flashing light equally rapidly setting up a second barrier where the ill fated vehicle would have no alternative but to stop and allow itself to be robbed

 Who are we going to choose from this lot then asked Cipriano Algor we can t possibly cope with more than three or four you have to remember that between now and then while the Center is making up its mind whether to buy them we re going to have to practice a lot if we want to deliver good quality presentable work Yes I know Pa but I think it would be best if we proposed six different figures said Marta then they ll either accept and we can divide production into two phases in which case it will be a question of agreeing to deadlines or and initially this is much more likely they themselves will choose two or three dolls to start with just to see if their customers would be interested and to test out their possible response And it might go no farther than that That s true but I think we ll have more chance of persuading them if we show them six designs numbers count numbers influence people it s a question of psychology Psychology never was my strong point Nor mine but even in our ignorance we sometimes have prophetic flashes of intuition Well don t aim those prophetic flashes at your father s future he has always preferred to find out each day what that day decides to bring him good or ill What the day brings is one thing what we ourselves contribute to the day is quite another The day before Sorry I don t know what you mean The day before is what we bring to the day we re actually living through life is a matter of carrying along all those days before just as someone might carry stones and when we can no longer cope with the load the work is done the last day is the only one that is not the day before another day Now you re just trying to depress me No I m not but if I am perhaps you re to blame for that To blame for what With you I always end up talking about serious things All right let s talk about something even more serious let s select our dolls

 Right then he said I ll choose one and then you choose one until we ve got six but remember we have to bear in mind the ease of the work and the known or presumed taste of our customers OK you begin The jester said the father The clown said the daughter The nurse said the father The Eskimo said the daughter The mandarin said the father The naked man said the daughter No you can t choose the naked man you ll have to choose another one the Center won t want a naked man Why not Well because he s naked The naked woman then That s even worse But she s covering herself up Covering yourself up like that is worse than showing everything How come you know so much about the subject Because I ve lived I ve looked I ve read and I ve felt What does reading do You can learn almost everything from reading But I read too So you must know something Now I m not so sure You ll have to read differently then How The same method doesn t work for everyone each person has to invent his or her own whichever suits them best some people spend their entire lives reading but never get beyond reading the words on the page they don t understand that the words are merely stepping stones placed across a fast flowing river and the reason they re there is so that we can reach the farther shore it s the other side that matters Unless Unless what Unless those rivers don t have just two shores but many unless each reader is his or her own shore and that shore is the only shore worth reaching Well observed said Cipriano Algor you have shown yet again that old people should never argue with the younger generations we always end up losing although we do learn a thing or two on the way Glad to have been of help Now let s get back to the sixth doll It can t be the naked man No Or the naked woman No Then let s have the fakir In general fakirs like scribes and potters are sitting down when he s standing up a fakir is just like any other man and sitting down he ll be smaller than the others In that case what about the musketeer The musketeer would do but we d have to find a solution to the problem of the sword and the feathers on his hat we could probably manage the feathers but the sword would have to be fixed to his leg and then it would look more like a splint All right then the bearded Assyrian Suggestion accepted let s have the bearded Assyrian he s easy and compact And I did consider the hunter and his hound but the dog would cause even more difficulties than the musketeer s sword Not to mention the shotgun said Cipriano Algor and speaking of dogs I wonder what Found is up to we ve forgotten all about him He s probably sleeping

 Marta put the book down and said We re not much farther forward Yes we are now we know that we won t be able to work without deflocculants and that until we have duck s feet we won t have any usable casting slip Well I m glad you re in a good mood Moods are like the tides they come in and they go out mine has just come in we ll see how long it lasts It has to last this house is in your hands The house is yes but not life Has the tide gone out already asked Marta It s hesitant vacillating not quite sure whether it s high tide or low tide Then stay with me because I m in a fluctuating mood as if I wasn t quite sure that I am what I think I am Sometimes I think we might be better off not knowing who we are said Cipriano Algor Like Found Yes I imagine that a dog knows less about himself than he does about his master he can t even recognize himself in a mirror Perhaps a dog s mirror is his master perhaps that s the only mirror in which he can recognize himself suggested Marta It s a nice idea You see even wrong ideas can be nice If the pottery goes under we can always breed dogs There are no dogs at the Center Poor Center not even dogs want to live there It s the Center that doesn t want the dogs Well that problem is of interest solely to those who live there said Cipriano Algor in an angry tone of voice

 When Cipriano Algor returned home on the first day of the week of destruction more incensed at the indignity of it all than exhausted by the effort involved he recounted to his daughter the absurd adventure of a man traipsing around the countryside in search of some deserted place where he could unload the useless crocks he was carrying as if it were his own excrement Caught with my trousers down he was saying that s what I felt like on the two occasions when people came to ask me what I was doing there on private property with a van overflowing with pots and plates I had to make up some feeble excuse about trying to get to a road farther along and thinking that this was the best route to take I m terribly sorry and by the way if there s anything in the van you d like I ll be happy to give it to you one of them was very rude and said that in his house even the animals wouldn t eat their food off rubbish like that but the other one took a fancy to a casserole dish and carried it off So where did you leave the stuff in the end Near the river Where Well I d thought a natural cave would be the best bet but even then there was always the chance that the things would be on full view to anyone passing by and that they would immediately recognize the product and the maker and we ve suffered enough embarrassments and humiliations as it is I don t feel particularly embarrassed or humiliated Perhaps you would if you had been in my place from the beginning Yes you re probably right so did you manage to find somewhere The ideal hollow Is there such a thing as the ideal hollow asked Marta That depends on what you want to put inside it but imagine in this case a large more or less circular hollow with trees and bushes growing in it about nine feet deep and with an easy slope down into it which seen from the outside looks like a green island in the middle of the countryside in the winter it fills up with water in fact there s still some water in the bottom now It s about a hundred yards from the river edge said Marta Oh so you know it said her father Yes I discovered it when I was ten years old and it really was the ideal hollow whenever I went down into it I felt as if I were going through a door into another world Yes I used to go down there too when I was about that age And my grandfather when he was that age And my grandfather too Everything is lost in the end Pa for years the hollow was just a hollow as well as a magic door for a few imaginative children and now it ll get filled up with debris and it will be neither one thing nor the other There aren t that many pots and plates and the brambles will soon grow over them no one will even notice So you left it all there did you Yes I did At least it s near the village one day one of the children here if that is they still visit the ideal hollow will turn up at home with a cracked plate they ll ask him where he found it and before you know it everyone will be rushing over there to take their pick of the very things that right now nobody wants It wouldn t surprise me in the least that s the way people are

 As the spade reached farther into the pit the ashes became hotter but not enough to burn him they were merely warm like human skin and just as smooth and soft

 But what Pencroft thought most probable was that Neb had pushed his researches on the shore farther than the day before and that he had not as yet had time to return

 Nearly a third replied Harding for we have descended a hundred feet from the opening and it is not impossible that a hundred feet farther down Where is Top asked Neb interrupting his master

 What is the exact distance that separates the earth from her satellite The moon does not describe a circle round the earth but an ellipse of which our earth occupies one of the foci the consequence is therefore that at certain times it approaches nearer to and at others recedes farther from the earth or in astronomical language it has its apogee and its perigee

 But the circle of these devastations extended farther still and beyond the limits of the United States

 The projectile began to get farther away from the lunar disc and the details of the ground began to be lost in a confused jumble

 During this discussion fruitful in somewhat hazardous theories although it resumed the general ideas of science on the subject the projectile had run rapidly towards the lunar equator at the same time that it went farther away from the lunar disc

 At last as the projectile went farther and farther away the details faded from the travellers eyes the mountains were confounded in the distance and all that remained of the marvellous fantastical and wonderful satellite of the earth was the imperishable remembrance

 Remark my friends that in the position now occupied by the projectile a position still oblique to the lunar disc our rockets by altering its direction might take it farther away instead of nearer to the moon

 The corvette moved some minutes farther west and the apparatus provisioned with air again took the same explorers to the depths of the ocean

 That was a year ago and it is very possible that Wilkes has gone farther than any of the preceding explorers

 Sir replied the captain since Arthur Pym and Dirk Peters were able to advance beyond Tsalal Island farther than the eighty third parallel since they found means of living in the midst of those Antarctic lands why should not their companions if they were not all killed by the natives if they were so fortunate as to reach the neighbouring islands sighted during the voyage why should not those unfortunate countrymen of mine have contrived to live there Why should they not still be there awaiting their deliverance Your pity leads you astray captain I replied

 She got farther than any ship had ever done before

 And it was beyond the eighty third nearly five hundred and fifty miles farther that we must go to the succour of the survivors of the Jane I confess that for a practical man of unimaginative temperament I felt strangely excited a nervous restlessness had taken possession of me

 He recognized afterwards that the Sandwiches only formed an Archipelago but nevertheless his belief that a polar continent farther south exists remained firm and unchanged

 Yes with the help of God Cook did not hesitate to assert that no one would ever venture farther than he had gone and that the Antarctic lands if any such existed would never be seen but the future will prove that he was mistaken

 Were not these facts providential Nay I go farther still and am sure that after having done so much to guide us towards our compatriots God will not abandon us I think as you think captain

 The French word is banquise which means the vast stretch of icebergs farther south than the barri re or ice wall

 But then where were they The valley of Klock Klock extended no farther we had to retrace our steps in order to regain the coast

 Now my companions were engaged for a voyage which was not to take them farther beyond the icebergs than Tsalal Island

 Hearne offered no farther opposition it would always be in his power to put in his word when the stances should be more propitious

 Our sole chance of discovering the unfortunate castaways was to continue our voyage for two or three parallels farther the goal was there and which of us would not sacrifice even his life to attain it God is guiding us Mr

 Well Dirk Peters I said I will ask you since you were anxious to hide your name what it was that induced you to reveal it when the Halbrane was moored off Tsalal Island why you did not keep to the name of Hunt Sir understand me there was hesitation about going farther they wanted to turn back

 But what would this unknown island five degrees farther off in the depths of the southern sea be for our schooner Was it the goal so ardently desired and so earnestly sought for Were the two brothers William and Len Guy to meet at this place Would the Halbrane come there to the end of a voyage whose success would be definitely secured by the restoration of the survivors of the fane to their country I repeat that I was just like the half breed

 Assuredly land is near If we seek it beyond those icebergs we shall discover it without much hard work or great danger What is one degree farther south when it is a question of putting a hundred additional dollars into one s pocket And let us not forget that if they are acceptable when they go in they are none the less so when they come out Upon this Endicott the cook came to the aid of his friend the boatswain

 Hallo repeated West stop there or we fire on the first who goes a step farther Both threatened the men with their pistols

 We were made anxious however by the fact that these masses were proceeding towards the iceberg barrier for would they not close the passages which ought to be still open at this time I shall mention here that in proportion as Dirk Peters was carried farther and farther from the places wherein no trace ofhis poor Pym had been found he was more silent than ever and no longer even answered me when I addressed him

 Our final word is that although the chances and the necessities of our voyage carried us farther towards the south pole than hose who preceded us although we actually did pass beyond the axial point of the terrestrial globe discoveries of great value still remain to be made in those waters Arthur Pym the hero whom Edgar Poe has made so famous has shown the way

 After all that dog which rang at the door of a convent to take possession of the plate intended for the poor passers by that other which commissioned at the same time with one of its kind to turn the spit for two days each and which refused to fill that office when its turn had not come those two dogs I say advanced farther than Dingo into that domain of intelligence reserved for man

 Captain Hull in making the circuit necessarily went farther than the Pilgrim which gradually grew smaller in the distance

 The young novice knew only too well that he was beyond the routes followed by the ships of commerce and that the other whalers were cruising still farther away at the fishing grounds

 Weldon no surely I do not hesitate replied the young novice but I cannot help regretting not being stranded a few degrees farther north or farther south

 And you shall have some humming birds my good little man but farther on farther on replied Harris

 If Negoro has known how to come as far as this he will know how to go farther

 In the region of the great lakes over all that vast country which feeds the market of Zanzibar in Bornou and Fezzan farther south on the banks of the Nyassa and the Zambesi farther west in the districts of the upper Zaire which the daring Stanley has just crossed is seen the same spectacle ruins massacres depopulation

 And so Harris said Negoro you have not been able to draw this little troop of Captain Sand as they call this novice of fifteen years any farther into Angola No comrade replied Harris and it is even astonishing that I have succeeded in leading him a hundred miles at least from the coast

 By this means they would be sure that the big child would keep quiet during the march because he could see no farther as they say than the end of his nose

 Meanwhile as it was impossible to abandon this shelter at a moment when the storm was raging with unparalleled intensity Dick Sand looked no farther for an explanation of what seemed to be inexplicable and he contented himself with saying Well Mr

 Never according to Livingstone never was the spirit of battle carried farther either among men or beasts With their tenacious jaws which tear out the piece these sirafous make the bravest man recoil

 Only for this sudden attack of which he had had no intimation to put him on his guard he would have found the Coanza a mile farther on

 Farther on great banyans of the kind whose seeds do not change into fruits completed the outline of this vast landscape

 Twenty miles farther on that same day the boat was suddenly stopped in its progress

 A little farther on is a large wooden shed the nature of which is easily distinguishable

 I cannot for the life of me see why the Count d Artigas should prohibit me from doing so for I cannot get farther than the surrounding walls of his mysterious domain

 A little farther on I encounter Engineer Serko

 Moreover we must look upon what is to occur as having already occurred and see nothing but the present in the future for the future is but the present a little farther on

 Richardson Barth and Overweg jealously anxious to push their investigations farther arrived at Tunis and Tripoli like their predecessors and got as far as Mourzouk the capital of Fezzan

 Penney the head of the Egyptian medical service who in a small steamer penetrated one degree beyond Gondokoro and then came back to die of exhaustion at Karthoum nor Miani the Venetian who turning the cataracts below Gondokoro reached the second parallel nor the Maltese trader Andrea Debono who pushed his journey up the Nile still farther could work their way beyond the apparently impassable limit

 See the country is already changing its aspect the villages are fewer and farther between the mango trees have disappeared for their growth ceases at this latitude

 At eight o clock it descended the farther slope the acclivity of which was much less abrupt

 Some underbrush which farther on became forests embellished the horizon

 He swept along over many villages without heeding the cries that the appearance of the balloon excited he took note of the conformation of places with quick sights he passed the slopes of the Rubemhe which are nearly as abrupt as the summits of the Ousagara and farther on at Tenga encountered the first projections of the Karagwah chains which in his opinion are direct spurs of the Mountains of the Moon

 In the west could be seen a low and but slightly diversified coast and farther away in the background the elevated plains of the Uganda and the Usoga

 The origin of its name like the origin of its waters has fired the imagination of the learned they have sought to trace it from the Greek the Coptic the Sanscrit but all that matters little now since we have made it surrender the secret of its source But said the Scotchman how are you to make sure of the identity of this river with the one recognized by the travellers from the north We shall have certain irrefutable convincing and infallible proof replied Ferguson should the wind hold another hour in our favor The mountains drew farther apart revealing in their place numerous villages and fields of white Indian corn doura and sugar cane

 A little farther on Kennedy called out Look at that strange tree The upper part is of one kind and the lower part of another Well said Joe here s a country where the trees grow on top of each other

 We must go a few degrees farther north to see them

 However he had to make up his mind to being borne farther to the northward and even a little to the east

 The river Shari which eighty miles farther on rolled its impetuous waters into Lake Tchad was quite distinctly seen

 Since its arrival at Lake Tchad the balloon had struck a current that edged it farther to the westward

 The force of the wind carried the doctor farther onward than he wanted to go but it changed a second time and bore him back exactly to his starting point on the sort of enclosed island where he had passed the preceding night

 It is but a few days replied the sportsman since we were congratulating ourselves upon having escaped so many dangers All three of us were shaking hands Poor Joe kindly and excellent disposition brave and candid heart Dazzled for a moment by his sudden discovery of wealth he willingly sacrificed his treasures And now he is far from us and the wind is carrying us still farther away with resistless speed Come doctor admitting that he may have found refuge among the lake tribes can he not do as the travellers who visited them before us did like Denham like Barth Both of those men got back to their own country

 And so he gave himself no farther concern about it

 She did indeed return but farther to the eastward

 That suits me said I for I can see better ahead of me and farther too

 Farther on and near to the Sane Gungu quarter is the Mosque of Sidi Yahia and some two story houses

 In he worked up farther to the northward and invested the fortification of Medina built by the French on the bank of the river

 The point of arrival seems to fly farther from our gaze

 Because they think that they are certain to take us replied the doctor and they will succeed if we descend much farther

 Suddenly after they had crossed the hill the doctor exclaimed The river the river the Senegal my friends And about two miles ahead of them there was indeed the river rolling along its broad mass of water while the farther bank which was low and fertile offered a sure refuge and a place favorable for a descent

 They had arrived at Senegal on Saturday the th of May and on the th of the same month they reached the post of Medina situated a little farther to the north but on the river

 Among the indigenous fowl which ran along the sand of the beach and pecked about among the sea weed and under the tufts of aquatic plants was it a dozen hens and two or three cocks of the American breed that they beheld No There was no mistake for at their approach did not a resounding cock a doodle do oo oo rend the air like the sound of a trumpet And farther off what were those quadrupeds which were gliding in and out of the rocks and making their way towards the first slopes of the hills or grubbing beneath some of the green shrubs Godfrey could not be mistaken

 Already the trees were getting farther apart from each other forming isolated groups and the rays of light penetrated more easily through the lofty branches

 Farther off on ground that grew gradually higher were scattered several clumps of trees made up of oaks and beeches sycamores and nettle trees but trees of great stature as they were they seemed but simple underwood by the side of the mammoths whose huge shadows the sun was throwing even into the sea

 It was a curious though very natural circumstance that the farther they advanced Tartlet perceiving no enemy little by little lost his terror and began to speak with scorn of those cannibal laughing stocks

 Was it going to the South Pole farther than the whaler Weddell or Captain James Ross But if so what for The day after the brig was floated her engine was sent from Hawthorn s foundry at Newcastle

 But why so Suppose he should wish to attempt some superhuman enterprise and to penetrate where others have never been able to reach do you believe if the crew knew it they would ever have enlisted As it is having got so far going farther becomes a necessity

 Well said Hatteras in a low tone our ice field has been drifting We are two degrees farther north and farther west and three hundred miles at least from your store of coal And those poor fellows don t know said the doctor

 CHAPTER XXVIII PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE Hatteras would not inform his crew of their situation for if they had known that they had been dragged farther north they would very likely have given themselves up to the madness of despair

 He was a hundred and fifty miles farther north scarcely eight degrees from the Pole But he hid his delight so profoundly that even the doctor did not suspect it he wondered at seeing an unwonted brilliancy in the captain s eyes but that was all and he never once thought of the reason

 The Forward by getting nearer the Pole had got farther away from the coal repository observed by Sir Edward Belcher instead of one hundred it lay at two hundred and fifty miles farther south

 A hundred steps farther a man met them wringing his hands before the Forward in flames

 Was he bent on going farther still Had his passion for travel no limits Was the world too small for him now he had circumnavigated it

 His mules could not go farther

 Young Robert held out manfully but he could not go much farther

 Still farther away a black spot almost invisible already caught Wilson s eye

 And I might go farther McNabbs replied the geographer impatient of contradiction

 Farther still Paganel

 Some miles farther the wheels of the wagon plowed deep into the alluvial soil where irregular creeks murmured in their beds half hidden among giant reeds

 Farther still beyond the hot springs and tumultuous geysers came the solfataras

 Still farther down in front of the facade dark masses obscured the rays of light which proceeded from the windows of the New Palace

 He had advanced farther than Lake Balkhash gaining over the Kirghiz population on his way

 He was not taken for a spy and therefore his neighbors without constraint gossiped in his presence allowing themselves even to go farther than their natural caution would in most cases have allowed them

 A little farther on the dry fields bordered with willows and aspens were scattered a few cows sheep and herds of pigs

 The way in which the iemschik harnessed them was thus one the largest was secured between two long shafts on whose farther end was a hoop carrying tassels and bells the two others were simply fastened by ropes to the steps of the tarantass

 Not an obstacle on the plain white and level farther than the eye could reach No rivers to stop one Hard ice everywhere the route open the road sure But at the price of what suffering Nadia those alone could say who have never returned but whose bodies have been covered up by the snow storm

 A few feet farther on and the mass would pass behind them Michael saw the tarantass struck his companion crushed he saw there was no time to drag her from the vehicle

 Just as the last growlings of the thunder were lost in the recesses of the mountain Michael felt Nadia s hand pressing his and he heard her whisper these words in his ear Cries brother Listen CHAPTER XI TRAVELERS IN DISTRESS DURING the momentary lull which followed shouts could be distinctly heard from farther on at no great distance from the tarantass

 Well sir you have done us a good turn and if you are going farther we may possibly meet again and Alcide Jolivet did not put any direct question to Michael as to where he was going but the latter not wishing it to be suspected that he had anything to conceal at once replied I am bound for Omsk gentlemen

 At four o clock in the evening they reached Abatskaia fifty miles farther on where the Ichim one of the principal affluents of the Irtych had to be crossed

 However at last the tarantass started and made such good way that by three in the afternoon it had reached Koulatsinskoe fifty miles farther on

 On the next day the st of August eighty miles farther Michael Strogoff arrived at midday at the town of Spaskoe and at two o clock he halted at Pokrowskoe

 If he had not been blind Nadia would have said to him Go Michael leave me in some hut Reach Irkutsk Accomplish your mission See my father Tell him where I am Tell him that I wait for him and you both will know where to find me Start I am not afraid I will hide myself from the Tartars I will take care of myself for him for you Go Michael I can go no farther Many times Nadia was obliged to stop

 Incredulous as they naturally were as to the assigned cause of the quarrel Servadac s friends had no alternative but to accept his explanation and without farther parley they started for the staff office where at two o clock precisely they were to meet the seconds of Count Timascheff

 Beyond this however the captain s poetical genius was impotent to carry him his farther efforts were unavailing and when at six o clock he reached the gourbi the four lines still remained the limit of his composition

 For about an hour some luminous body its disc evidently of gigantic dimensions shed its rays upon the upper strata of the clouds then marvelous to relate instead of obeying the ordinary laws of celestial mechanism and descending upon the opposite horizon it seemed to retreat farther off grew dimmer and vanished

 Twenty minutes sufficed to carry them over the four or five miles that intervened between the gourbi and the mouth of the Shelif then slackening their speed they proceeded at a more leisurely pace to the southeast along what had once been the right bank of the river but which although it still retained its former characteristics was now the boundary of a sea which extending farther than the limits of the horizon must have swallowed up at least a large portion of the province of Oran

 He felt that his judgment was utterly baffled his only remaining hope was that the chain of marvels was not yet complete and that something farther might throw some light upon the mystery

 They were not long in ascertaining that on the farther side of the point there was a small well sheltered creek of sufficient depth to accommodate a vessel of moderate tonnage

 After pondering awhile he said If we were farther away I should expect to find a depth of two or three hundred fathoms instead of five fathoms

 Eastwards or westwards asked the count which shall be our course All farther progress to the south is checked

 Having rounded the great promontory that had barred her farther progress to the north the schooner skirted its upper edge

 I mean said Procope that the farther this Gallia of ours recedes from the sun the lower the temperature will fall

 Yes and farther than that Captain

 A third shot fell still farther astern and in less than ten minutes the Dolphin was out of range of the corvette s guns

 Undoubtedly said Hobson all these pumice stones and pebbles have been discharged by them to this distance and if we were to go two or three miles farther we should find ourselves treading upon nothing but lava and ashes

 Had Fort Hope been situated at the Pole itself that is to say twenty degrees farther north the polar night would have set in on the st of that month But under the seventieth parallel the sun would be visible above the horizon for another month

 But Melville Island and Port Felix are some degrees farther north latitude than Cape Bathurst are they not Yes madam but in a certain sense we may say that their latitude proves nothing

 They belonged to the race of Esquimaux or eaters of raw flesh which is scattered over the continent of North America from Baffin s Bay to Behring Strait seldom however advancing farther south than the Great Slave Lake

 Cape Bathurst had drifted three degrees farther north since the arrival of the Lieutenant and his companions End of Part I PART II CONTENTS

 The next day after taking the bearings Hobson announced that without change of latitude the island had advanced several miles farther west

 No he said the sea is farther to the left we have not yet passed the wood between us and Cape Michael

 A few degrees farther south on the island of Sitka rises New Archangel the principal settlement in Russian America and the head quarters of the Russian Fur Company whose jurisdiction once extended over the whole of the Aleutian Islands

 The south east wind would drive the wandering island farther from the continent and fling it into the dangerous currents which must drift it to the north of the Arctic Ocean

 The gulf observed the night before might have spread farther and if so they would be cut off from their friends

 So that in spite of the violence of the hurricane the island had remained in much the same latitude although it had been drifted somewhat farther west

 The temperature fell some degrees farther the same day and the mists which had collected above the south eastern horizon the day before resolved themselves into snow during the night so that the next day the white carpet was two inches thick

 As they got farther from the fort Mrs Barnett noticed that the number of furred animals decreased considerably

 They did so and fifty paces farther on both again paused

 Yes replied Mrs Barnett a woman or a child has fallen here exhausted and risen again to stumble farther on look the footprints again and father on more falls Who who could it have been exclaimed Madge

 It was evident the poor wretch had been unable to walk farther and had crept along on hands and knees here and there fragments of torn clothes were scattered about bits of sealskin and fur

 She at once recognised the volcanic mountains shutting in Liverpool Bay and twenty miles farther east she came to Walruses Bay where her people had so often hunted morses and seals

 Under ordinary circumstances the reindeer Polar hares and even the wolves would have left early in September for the shores of the Great Bear and Slave Lakes a good many degrees farther south but now the sea was an insurmountable barrier and they too would have to wait until the winter should render it passable

 Victoria Island was drifting at a rate of from twelve to thirteen miles a day so that each day took them the same distance farther from the land and nearer to the north

 The winter was coming at last but it did not set in rapidly or with any rigour Victoria Island was now nearly a degree farther north than the seventieth parallel and on this st September a rotating motion was for the first time noticed a motion estimated by Hobson at about a quarter of the circumference

 It advanced farther and farther north farther and farther away from all land

 Thanks to her we shall be easily able to get to the settlement of Fort Michael on Norton Sound perhaps even to New Archangel a good deal farther south where we can pass the rest of the winter

 Although Fort Hope was now about two degrees farther north than at the same time the year before there was no sensible difference in the state of the temperature

 The monster made its way thus for about a quarter of a mile across the ice and then its farther progress being barred it turned round and advanced towards the spot where Mrs Barnett and the Lieutenant stood

 All the icebergs and floes here had come from latitudes farther north and if we may so express it lived upon the cold they had brought with them

 Yes before going farther I must make quite sure of the state of the ice field and that is what I am about to do

 And who can tell where the currents will then have taken Victoria Island either yet farther north or to the Behring Sea Yes Lieutenant you are right replied Long let us remain together and if we are to be saved in a boat there is Mac Nab s on Victoria Island and for it at least we shall not have to wait Mrs Barnett had listened without saying a word but she understood that the ice field being impassible

 We are now added the Lieutenant cut off from all communication with the mainland and by going farther towards the east we run a risk after enduring great fatigues of finding it impossible to get back to the island now our only refuge

 Have you forgotten that it was the Kamtchatka Current which brought us where we now are and which may seize us again when the thaw sets in and carry us yet farther north I do not think it will madam indeed I feel quite sure that that will not happen

 Car to pickup to SUV he was impelled to venture farther into the parking lot not with the urgency that had earlier caused him to turn the Expedition on a dime and leave nine cents change but with a nonetheless motivating perception that an important opportunity would shortly be foreclosed if he didn t act

 They had ventured a few feet farther from the restaurant since he d last seen them but only far enough for Jilly to retrieve the copy of Great Expectations that Dylan had dropped

 He reached farther through the gateway extending his hand in there to the wrist and although he winced at the bitter cold was nearly overwhelmed by revulsion at the hideous crawly sensation he reached in still farther all the way to his elbow and then of course as instinct might have warned him if he had been listening the tunnel took him

 He was confused he was scared and because his head might have exploded if he d stood here as silent as Shep he said again This is nuts Miles farther north in the deserted parking lot of a state beach their father had committed suicide fifteen years ago

 I was off the boat blown up off the water and skating the wind with those black birds high above myself and I could look down and see myself and the rest of the guys see the boat rocking there in the middle of those diving birds see McMurphy surrounded by his dozen people and watch them us swinging a laughter that rang out on the water in ever widening circles farther and farther until it crashed up on beaches all over the coast on beaches all over all coasts in wave after wave after wave

 The black boy moved the tube forward a few inches and George listed farther back shaking his head

 Even farther Jondalar said

 We made camp each night in a different place going farther from the valley than I had gone before

 They walked a little farther

 It s one thing for me to cast a spear a long way but when they see that a woman using the spear thrower can fling a spear farther than any of the men that will make them interested Jondalar said

 She made a few more demonstrations but unmoving targets seemed rather commonplace and even if the spear did fly farther than anyone had ever seen a woman throw before they had already watched Jondalar do that several times

 It went less than half the distance down the course than either Ayla s or Jondalar s spears had gone but it was still much farther than anyone expected a boy to cast a spear especially one with his affliction

 As for the ark though scarcely farther from the canoe than the point it lay so completely buried in the shadows of the shore that it would not have been visible even had there been many degrees more of light than actually existed

 In the meanwhile the ark swept onward and by the time the scene with the torches was enacting beneath the trees it had reached the open lake Floating Tom causing it to sheer farther from the land with a sort of instinctive dread of retaliation

 Judith and Hetty had now discovered that something was wrong and were stationary a thousand feet farther north

 As the ark necessarily sailed before the wind it had got by this time quite two hundred yards from the castle and was sliding away each instant farther and farther though with a motion so easy as scarcely to stir the water

 Hetty was oncommon as all that know d her must allow and her soul was as fit to consort with angels the hour it left its body as that of any saint in the Bible I do believe you only do her justice Alas alas that there should be so great differences between those who were nursed at the same breast slept in the same bed and dwelt under the same roof But no matter move the canoe a little farther east Deerslayer the sun so dazzles my eyes that I cannot see the graves

 It was right at the bottom of the hamper and seemed difficult to find and he had to lean over farther and farther and in trying to steer at the same time from a topsy turvy point of view he pulled the wrong line and sent the boat into the bank and the shock upset him and he dived down right into the hamper and stood there on his head holding on to the sides of the boat like grim death his legs sticking up into the air

 Grant s army in North Mississippi was in full retreat Van Dorn had broken loose in its immediate rear and burned its forward supply base at Holly Springs capturing the garrison in the process while Brigadier General Nathan Bedford Forrest even farther in the northern commander s rear was wrecking vital supply lines and creating general havoc all over West Tennessee

 Held by the Federals for nearly a year now the town had been the base for their mid December advance against the Wilmington Weldon Railroad sixty miles away at Goldsboro and it was Longstreet s belief that an attack on both banks of the Neuse River farther down would pinch off the blue garrison and expose it to capture or destruction

 There were fords in that direction Banks Ford five miles above the town and United States Ford seven miles farther west behind which he could mass and conceal his troops in order to send them splashing across in a rush that would smother the south bank gray outpost detachments thus forcing Lee to face about and meet his assailants without the advantage of those formidable intrenchments

 Jackson for one was eager to give it to them whereas Lee preferred to draw them farther away from their heavy guns on Stafford Heights

 next morning May by which time he had withdrawn another three miles up the Canton road still farther from the intended point of concentration at Clinton

 Our being compelled to leave Jackson makes your plan impracticable he replied and repeated despite Pemberton s objection to being drawn still farther from his base his preference for an eastward march by the mobile force from Vicksburg The only mode by which we can unite is by your moving directly to Clinton informing me that I may move to that point with about troops

 That was as the crow flew moreover and for anyone but a crow it would have been considerably farther not only because Jeb had no more notion of Lee s whereabouts than Lee had of his but also because a good many of those intervening miles were occupied by the Federal army which Lee mistakenly assumed to be still south of the Potomac but which in fact was being alerted even now for a resumption of its northward march at dawn

 Because I m realizing it now too late too late that of course the Mayor s got inside Todd of course he has and maybe Todd has changed him changed him for the better no doubt but the Mayor s always been stronger always been smarter and changing for the better doesn t mean that he s ever going to reach good and of course he s been changing Todd too of course he has how could I be so stupid not to see it not to talk to him Not to save him Todd I call But it s drowned out by a surge in the Noise of the crowd images from the far side where something s happening something that s being passed along through the Noise of the people seeing it spreading through the crowd Noise that shows two Spackle coming up the road Two Spackle on battlemores one of them sitting rather than standing And with a jolt I see that the standing one is the same Spackle who attacked me But there s no time for that feeling because the Noise suddenly corrects itself And the seated Spackle isn t a Spackle It s a man And in the Noise of the crowd passed along like a baton in a race I can hear it The man is singing TODD My stomach drops outta the bottom of my feet and my breath feels like I m choking and my legs are moving and I m tearing outta the Mayor s grip feeling the bruises as he don t wanna let me go But I m going Oh Christ I m going Todd he calls after me real shock in his voice real pain that I m running from him But I m running There ain t nothing gonna stop me from running MOVE I shout And the soldiers and men in front of me move right outta the way like they didn t even decide to themselves Cuz they didn t Todd I hear behind me still the Mayor but getting farther behind Cuz up ahead Oh Jesus I don t believe it I don t believe it MOVE IT And I m trying to listen trying to listen for the sound again trying to listen for the song And the crowd keeps moving getting outta my way like I m a fire come to burn em And the Spackle s coming thru their Noise too It s The Spackle is NO I call and run even harder Cuz I don t know what it means that is here But there he is in the Noise of the crowd Getting brighter and clearer as I get closer Way clearer than Noise usually is Todd I hear behind me But I don t stop Cuz as I m getting closer even the rising Noise of the crowd can t cover it up The song Clear as the air Ripping my heart right in two The song my song Early one mo o rning just as the sun was rising 

 There s the Spackle that tried to kill me riding a battlemore and Ben s sitting behind him on another one the song he s singing coming clear I heard a maiden call from the valley below But his mouth isn t moving Which must be a mistake of the crowd Noise But he s there riding up the road and since no one here can know him his face must be accurate it must really be Ben And I can feel the Mayor s medicine surging through me and I use my new strength to start shoving people out of the way even harder Because in their Noise I can see the Mayor pushing forward ahead of me too And I see that Todd s reached Ben See it like I m right there Feel it like I m right there because Todd s own Noise has opened as he s got farther away from the Mayor and closer to Ben his own Noise is opening as wide as it used to be opening with astonishment and joy and so much love you can hardly bear to look at it and those feelings are surging back along the crowd like a wave and the crowd is staggering under it staggering under the feeling that Todd s transmitting to them Transmitting it just like the Mayor can TODD I can t even say nothing I just can t there ain t no words for it as I m running to him running right past and Ben s coming down off his battlemore and his Noise is rising to greet me with everything I know about him everything since I was a baby everything that means he s really Ben And he ain t quite saying it in words And he s opening up his arms and I m throwing myself into em and I m hitting him so hard we fall back against the beast he was riding and How big you ve gotten he says Ben I say gasping the words Aw Jesus Ben You re as tall as me he says

 The voice of the Sky reaches back and back and back passed along through the Pathways and the Land itself through forests I have never seen across lands unknown by any of the Clearing reaching voices of the Land that sound strangely accented and different But the same too the same voice of the Land The Sky is calling out to all of them every voice reaching farther at once than any Sky ever has The entire voice of the Land streams itself into the march All of us coming together To meet the Clearing And then shows the Source still on his beast still on my heels still pestering me I think it is time for you to leave us I show

 And even when it turned out that the withdrawal had been unnecessary because his prediction was fulfilled Steele veered from his southwest course on April for an eastward strike at Camden which would put him as far from Shreveport as he had been when he crossed the Little Missouri a week ago and Porter not only ventured no farther up the Red he was even now bumping his way downstream in an effort to rejoin Banks Taylor constituted no real threat to the Federals intrenched at Grand Ecore even though he was free at last to move against them since he had by then a good deal less than one fourth the number of soldiers his adversary believed he was about to use in an all out assault on the blufftop citadel

 This was the firing the soldiers heard at the end of their long march from Grand Ecore and when Porter reached Alexandria next morning April he saw at close range the validity of his other reason for having abandoned the deep draft ironclad far upstream which was that even if he had managed to get her this far down he would not have been able to get her one mile farther

 What was worse with Richmond not much farther south than he had come already he seemed likely to accomplish a great deal more unless Stuart found some way to check or divert him

 It was too late to send for Beauregard and none of his three ranking lieutenants one legged Ewell who was also nearing physical collapse or sickly Hill who had shown only the day before that he was in no condition for larger duties or lackluster Anderson who had been less than three weeks in command of anything more than a division seemed capable of exploiting the present opportunity which would vanish as soon as the Federals spotted the danger and reacted either by intrenching or by pulling back across the river for a crossing farther down beyond reach of the trap that had been installed for their undoing

 Hearing before sunset of the reverse at Five Forks though not of its extent which would leave Pickett gunless by nightfall and unable to muster infantry in his shattered ranks next morning Lee ordered Anderson to have Bushrod Johnson march his three remaining brigades at once to Sutherland Station three miles north on the Southside Railroad to combine with Pickett and Fitz Lee for the defense of that vital supply line and the even more vital Richmond Danville farther west

 And lest the People should think you cannot possibly go any farther pass another solemn declaratory Act that King Lords and Commons had hath and of Right ought to have full Power and Authority to make Statutes of sufficient Force and Validity to bind the unrepresented Provinces IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER

 Send Armies into their Country under Pretence of protecting the Inhabitants but instead of garrisoning the Forts on their Frontiers with those Troops to prevent Incursions demolish those Forts and order the Troops into the Heart of the Country that the Savages may be encouraged to attack the Frontiers and that the Troops may be protected by the Inhabitants This will seem to proceed from your III will or your Ignorance and contribute farther to produce and strengthen an Opinion among them that you are no longer fit to govern them

 And we recommend it to the provincial conventions and to the committees in the respective colonies to establish such farther regulations as they may think proper for carrying into execution this association

 Nay I believe We may advance one Step farther and affirm that the Ballance of Power in a Society accompanies the Ballance of Property in Land

 Deeply impressed with a Sense of the extensive Advantages which would probably result to the United States in general and this in particular from a perfect and permanent Reconciliation with an Enemy so formidable to a weak and extensive Frontier as fatal Experience has evinced the Indians to be to whom Distance of Situation seems no great Obstacle to prevent or retard their Incursions reflecting with the most anxious Concern on the Desolation and Variety of Distress incident on a Savage War apprehensive that they would consider themselves without any Alternative but that of recommencing Hostilities dreading the Effects of a consequent Desperation on their part firmly believing that the greatly deranged State of the public Finances would render it exceedingly difficult to procure the necessary Supplies for that Army only which must keep the Enemy s Force on the Sea Board in Check doubtful whether Detachments of sufficient Force to protect the Frontiers could be spared from our Army whilst the British retained their present position aware of the Distresses and Expence incident on calling forth the Militia for the purpose convinced that an Obstacle of very interesting Importance would be removed if Events should happily arise which would permit us to turn our Attention to the Reduction of Canada or the Enemies Fortresses in the interior parts of the Country persuaded that no farther offensive Operations could be prosecuted against the Savages with any probable prospect of adequate Advantage I embraced the earliest Opportunity to advise Congress of the Overtures made by the Cayugas and took the Liberty strongly to point at the Necessity of an Accommodation with all the Savages but not being honored with an Answer as early as the Importance of the Object seemed to require and wishing to improve the Advantage which the first Impulse occasioned by the Disaster the Indians had experienced would probably afford us I hastened to Congress to sollicit their Determination which was obtained on the November last Copy whereof I have the Honor to enclose

 The Motion was nevertheless after some farther desultory Debate rejected but from what drop d in the Debate we had Reason to apprehend that several who were opposed to the Motion founded their Opposition on the Necessity of a Reconciliation with the Indians against which they imagined the Spirit of the Motion would militate

 Let it then be farther supposed in the Case already stated that the Party should annually borrow the Sum of ten Pounds to pay Part of his Tax of fifteen Pounds at six per Cent

 This Mode of Reasoning might be pursued farther but what has been said is sufficient to shew that he would have made a considerable Advantage from the yearly Loan

 Domestic Loans are also useful from the farther Consideration that as Taxes fall heavy on the lower Orders of a Community the Releif obtained for them by such Loans more than counterballances the Loss sustained by those who would have borrowed Money to extend their Commerce or Tillage

 I shall close this Subject by adding that as such a Tax would besides the Benefits to be derived from the Object of it have the farther Advantage of encouraging Settlements and Population This would redound not only to the national Good but even to the particular Good of the Land holders themselves

 I should farther propose that the Surplus of each of these Revenues and Care should be taken that there would be a Surplus should be carried to a Sinking Fund on the Credit of which and of the general Promises of Government new Loans should be opened when necessary

 annum on her said Quota and if the requisition shall be for Land forces and any State shall neglect to furnish her quota in time the average expence of such quota shall be ascertained by Congress and such State shall be charged therewith or with the average expence of what she may be deficient and in addition thereto from the time her forces were required to be ready to act in the field with a farther sum which sum shall be at the rate of twelve per Cent per Annum on the amount of such expences

 Should a farther reward however be judged equitable I will venture to assert no one will enjoy greater satisfaction than myself on seeing an exemption from Taxes for a limited time which has been petitioned for in some instances or any other adequate immunity or compensation granted to the brave defenders of their Country s Cause but neither the adoption or rejection of this proposition will in any manner af fect much less militate against the Act of Congress by which they have offered five years full pay in lieu of the half pay for life which had been before promised to the Officers of the Army

 So far and no farther authorized they organized the government by the ordinance entitled a constitution or form of government

 The bill reported by the revisers does not itself contain this proposition but an amendment containing it was prepared to be offered to the legislature whenever the bill should be taken up and farther directing that they should continue with their parents to a certain age then to be brought up at the public expense to tillage arts or sciences according to their geniuses till the females should be eighteen and the males twenty one years of age when they should be colonized to such place as the circumstances of the time should render most proper sending them out with arms implements of household and of the handicraft arts seeds pairs of the useful domestic animals c

 and yielded no farther to the expostulations of their deputies than barely to rescind her vote of refusal without passing any positive act of compliance

 In these sentiments Sir I agree to this Constitution with all its faults if they are such because I think a general Government necessary for us and there is no form of Government but what may be a blessing to the people if well administered and believe farther that this is likely to be well administered for a course of years and can only end in Despotism as other forms have done before it when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic Government being incapable of any other

 They tend to convince me that it cannot be carried with propriety very far that the convention have gone much farther in one respect than they found it practicable to go in another that is they propose to lodge in the general government very extensive powers powers nearly if not altogether complete and unlimited over the purse and the sword

 On the whole the position appears to me to be undeniable that this bill of rights ought to be carried farther and some other principles established as a part of this fundamental compact between the people of the United States and their federal rulers

 These sometimes extend no farther than to the injury of the private rights of particular classes of citizens by unjust and partial laws

 But they wish the revisal to be carried no farther than to supply additional guards for liberty without abridging the sum of power transferred from the States to the general Government or altering previous to trial the particular structure of the latter and are fixed in opposition to the risk of another Convention whilst the purpose can be as well answered by the other mode provided for introducing amendments

 In the declaration of rights which that country has established the truth is they have gone no farther than to raise a barrier against the power of the Crown the power of the Legislature is left altogether indefinite

 CHAPTER Endless Doppelg ngers The Quilted Multiverse If you were to head out into the cosmos traveling ever farther would you find that space goes on indefinitely or that it abruptly ends Or perhaps would you ultimately circle back to your starting point like Sir Francis Drake when he circumnavigated the earth Both possibilities a cosmos that stretches infinitely far and one that is huge but finite are compatible with all our observations and over the past few decades leading researchers have vigorously studied each

 billion years old you might think that anything farther away than 

 b will increase with more time light can travel farther and so each of the cosmic horizons will grow larger

 b their centers will need to be farther apart but with infinite space at our disposal there s ample room to accommodate this adjustment

 The farther apart they are the greater the expansion s speed the ultimate result is that distant bubbles move apart faster than the speed of light

 From farther away it looks like Marilyn Monroe

 Much as a ball with a high speed can escape the earth s gravity and head ever farther outward if the speed of spatial expansion were high enough and the rate of its slowdown sufficiently meager space could expand forever

 For objects that are farther away the jumping is less noticeable because the difference in angle gets smaller

 Another approach which has the capacity to measure yet greater celestial distances is based on an even simpler idea the farther away you move a light emitting object be it a car s headlights or a blazing star the more the emitted light will spread out during its journey toward you and so the dimmer it will appear

 The degree to which one standard candle appeared dimmer than another would tell you directly how much farther away it is

 Without increasing your intrinsic speed you travel farther than you otherwise would because the moving walkway augments your motion

 Similarly without increasing its intrinsic speed light from a distant supernova travels farther than it otherwise would because during its journey the stretching space augments its motion

 With accelerated expansion space will continue to spread indefinitely dragging away distant galaxies ever farther and ever faster

 If earth were much closer or much farther away from the sun the temperature would be much hotter or colder eliminating an essential ingredient for our form of life liquid water

 The expansion of the universe means the galaxies are now farther apart which is reflected mathematically in the universe s scale factor being larger

 Farther than that distance space will always be receding from us so quickly that any attempt to breach the separation would be as fruitless as a kayaker navigating against a current flowing faster than she can paddle

 When we receive the light the object is thus farther away much farther than 

 The light from objects farther than this distance would not yet have had enough time to reach us and so are beyond our cosmic horizon

 Taking the expansion equations seriously to arbitrarily early times and for definiteness imagine that space is spherically shaped we also see that the two regions would have initially separated more quickly in the standard big bang than in the inflationary model that s how they became so much farther apart in the standard big bang compared with their separation in the inflationary theory

 If one compares the trajectories of two regions of a given distance apart in the very early universe then in the inflationary theory those regions separate much faster than in the standard big bang theory by today they are also much farther apart in the inflationary theory than in the conventional big bang

 is related to the size of the coefficients for each mode in this expansion farther to the right on the horizontal axis corresponds to smaller angular separation

 A bell rang and a light showed over another door farther down

 Standing up and quite preventing Poirot from advancing any farther were a big man in blue uniform the chef de train and his own Wagon Lit conductor

 The laughter and the male sounds were still there but now they were muted and farther away

 Through most of Queens and the Bronx everything looked dirty and gray and old but farther along the building density diminished until as I approached White Plains stretches of empty land appeared bordered by stands of trees and just north of White Plains there were lakes

 Farther back there were tables and chairs for people with a greater sense of formality

 He screamed You poked out my fuckin eye I m gonna be blind I pulled him up and led him farther back into the bar

 I gunned the engine and forced the LeBaron across the field sideways half the time and near out of control until the flat right rear dug into the loam maybe three hundred yards from the road and the LeBaron wouldn t go any farther

 Half a mile farther down the road there was an orange wind sock flapping in the wind and a utility shed and a corrugated metal hangar

 She pushed at him again succeeding only in digging herself farther into the snow

 The other farther down the hill

 Wish took his paper back and moved farther down the table out of Artie s reach

 Don t go any farther she said through the wool hat

 As a steady breeze blew over the lake the water churned pushing her out farther than she liked

 I had often gone along the top of it but seldom explored on the farther side

 She hesitated then pushed the bushes farther apart

 The interruptions were expensive and wasteful moreover they always brought anxiety if the trouble was near our sector nobody could be sure that they might not come farther one time

 He turned his attention to Sophie who was wading to the bank shoes in hand some yards farther up

 A day or two s sail farther on there s plenty of Badlands coastline with no doubt about it

 They felt they were leaving all Purity behind and sailing farther and farther away from God where He d not be able to help them

 Farther south still you begin to find patches where only coarse plants grow and poorly at that and soon you come to stretches of coast and land behind it twenty thirty forty miles long maybe where nothing grows nothing at all

 Farther on perhaps

 Farther than you went I suggested

 You can t go farther on

 The other six were Michael who lived about three miles to the north Sally and Katherine whose homes were on neighbouring farms two miles farther on and therefore across the border of the adjoining district Mark almost nine miles to the north west and Anne and Rachel a pair of sisters living on a big farm only a mile and a half to the west

 A quarter of a mile farther on I pushed through more undergrowth and reached an open glade

 When I reached the edge of the trees it occurred to me that I was leaving Petra unprotected so I went no farther

 Three or four miles farther on we came out into more open country but not like any region we had seen before

 Whether or not the pursuit would risk following any farther we could not tell

 They think it s too risky to come farther into the Fringes in small groups

 Farther into the Fringes that is Yes

 As they reckon it they and only they are in the true image very well then it follows that if the image is true they themselves must be God and being God they reckon themselves entitled to decree thus far and no farther

 There was a murmur of voices a slight composite stir of small movements a night bird calling harshly a little distance away the cry of an animal still farther off

 Sophie was sitting close to the entrance the rest of us farther back out of sight from the ground

 If you delayed until spring the remains would migrate even farther

 The houses are spread farther apart

 They were trapped Four more giant Fefze beetles came scurrying toward them from farther away at the front of the gorge

 Someone s trapped Luke touched the rock facing that covered the door moving his hand along the surface until he felt a piece of jagged rock that was sticking out farther than the rest

 How how much farther do you think it is Tahiri asked collapsing beside Anakin during one of their rest breaks

 Don t go any farther

 Can you move farther away from them No room Uldir shouted back

 Uldir backed farther away

 How much farther he cried wheezing and struggling to continue climbing

 Get away from me But the phantom kept coming pushing me ever farther from safety

 Farther on Heath and John looked to be making good progress and Kim and Meg were doing great too

 As I looked farther I could see that the oak was sitting in the center of a mammoth piece of flat rock and to one side was the vast openness of the sea to the other the bluffs of the Irish coastline and just to my left was the unmistakable shape of Dunlow Castle

 It was farther down the hallway in one of the rooms near the end

 He scowled and hunched farther into the blanket wrapped round his shoulders nibbling away at his third breakfast roll like a hungry squirrel with his last nut

 It had moved even farther away from us but it was pacing again like a caged animal hissing and growling and spitting in our direction

 We continued to the back of the small chapel and the phantom appeared to grow more and more agitated the farther away we got but it made no further move to approach us even though I was sure the range of our magnets no longer extended to it out in the hallway

 Heath slumped farther down in his seat

 Maybe I ll just poke around for a bit I suggested before getting up and walking down a little farther checking each name until I finally found Meara s tomb

 We then drove an hour and a half to an all night hardware store where we got our supplies and just before dawn when Heath called to say that Alex had only a minor concussion Gilley and I hustled our butts back to the castle once again using the underground tunnel but making sure to park our van much farther down the beach and well out of sight of the causeway

 She had been on longer voyages with her father and traveled farther than on this last trip

 Farther offshore the silhouette of the Marietta was just visible in a drifting fog bank

 Except He stepped back farther from the bluff and squinted up

 It moved more smoothly than its partner but not much farther

 Then came a slow gliding movement upward as the power of the Force helped the transport move several feet farther

 She told me she didn t have money for that but she did have money to take the dog to the pound which was farther 

 We walk farther

 The countrified accents weren t always easy to comprehend but Luzelle picked up enough to know that Szett Urrazole and her Miracle Self Propelling Carriage were drawing farther ahead with every passing hour

 No use thinking of Szett Urrazole drawing farther and farther ahead

 Nobody will go much farther along the Grand Ellipse tonight

 Should she fail to secure transportation she would find herself obliged to seek the nearest decent hotel there to sit cooling her heels for the next twelve hours or more during which time the Festinettes would increase their ill gotten lead and farther yet along the Grand Ellipse the Stornzof kinsmen would doubtless be doing the same

 Yes and how many more of the same between herself and the border And after the border farther east deep in the stronghold of the Gifted Iyecktor how much the worse For a moment she was almost glad that she spoke no Aennorvi otherwise she would have wanted to stay and argue

 A little farther Karsler urged his calm tones oddly underscoring the chant of native voices

 How much farther Without troubling to answer he altered direction leading her off along some anonymous little lane terminating in a makeshift bridge of slime slicked planks spanning a runnel thick with raw sewage

 They went first to a clean freshly painted beautifully maintained little packet whose spit and polish westernized native skipper expressed perfect willingness to carry them as far as Nishq tla Camp the last port of call along his usual route but not a mile farther

 Karsler s pulling farther ahead every minute

 Farther along the road the second bridge spanning an expanse of inky water was similarly ornate but utilitarian

 It is that you have a chance to go consider ably farther in the Tourney than I do you are a skilled player while my skills are largely limited to this particular pursuit

 A little farther down Madison I spot a man in a skullcap washing the front window of a restaurant his disgruntled reflection crystal clear in the wake of his squeegee

 Crossing the street I see him farther up the block

 The sidewalk is crowded and I try my best to weave in and out of pissed off looking people while keeping an eye on the gray coat and crew cut head bobbing farther up the block

 Who wouldn t Farther down the hallway I slip into Sean s room

 They re not cuddling nestling or spooning in fact Michael couldn t be any farther away from her without rolling off the mattress

 Terribly wrong I get no farther than a few steps when those sunken eyes explode with fear

 Farther down the block I see an older man perhaps in his seventies sitting on a stoop reading the Daily News

 Quickly glancing around I spot the couple farther down the sidewalk

 If I know Penley it can t be too much farther

 Older The officer leans forward even farther stone faced

 What have you done Michael That s when I look farther into the bedroom and realize I only knew half of it

 Storage facilities locked sheds the large EDF hangar and a makeshift repair bay were located farther away from the main complex so far at least the Klikiss had paid no attention to them

 Hovering next to the buoy he swept the Gypsy s sensors farther down and detected a second faint signal which he followed deeper to another buoy then another and another

 Swift thinking EDF fighters grabbed them and hustled them farther along the tunnels to the exits

 Carrying green priests Roamer scouts had set up a picket line around the Theron system scattered ships circling farther and farther out

 Each step took them farther from the settlement and out into the open where Klikiss searchers could easily spot them

 We re not going to make it much farther Robb said

 Farther down the tunnel Davlin pressed up against the sticky bars

 And even those who have more than enough which is what Leo thinks about himself who use it up rapidly soon become sated with their own fantasy and then feel the need to go beyond farther than where they have already gone

 Jess watched the woman he loved take her place as a strong leader realizing she was farther away from him now than ever before

 Farther down the hill scores of the winged jellyfish things surrounded the transportal

 Anton thanked him and strolled farther on with a jaunty step

 He had gone farther out than that

 He would simply fly until he could go no farther

 Finally with careful timing he fired a burst of his engines flaming out the last of his fuel to give the ship a push taking it out of its decreasing velocity curve so that he could coast just a bit farther

 The farther away from our shipyards the better by damn Del Kellum said

 Peter stepped farther into the room

 Carol sank farther into her seat

 Let s go up farther so we can get a better view Kazem whispered

 I moved as far under the dashboard as I could and Kazem reached over to push me farther down

 He and Picard and Data spread out a little as they ventured farther into the room

 Perhaps the floor will level out farther on

 The walls absorbed sound and made the laughter seem much farther away than it was

 How much farther Vetween one and two of your hours

 They will help themselves become better in the struggle with this hostile planet they will help humanity stretch its empire farther into space

 He paused for a moment before opening the door as he caught sight of a strange transparent object just a little farther up the beach

 And then he thought why wow First who would know Second was it really incest She was a lot farther away relationwise than a second cousin say

 Spread out a little farther back there he called out to the men behind him

 About twenty twenty five paces farther on there ll be a second entrance a bigger one

 From an early age he had accompanied his uncle and his uncle s band on warfare and trading expeditions to the burrows a bit farther back

 He listened for a moment as the thumps drifted farther away and then died out

 The heavy squat man with the huge gnarled hands was the only member of the expedition who had penetrated farther into Monster territory than the larder

 You might make a useful rule out of it the farther back in the burrows you went the poorer the quality of the leadership in any emergency situation when you got to the Aaron People the back back burrowers so to speak you had band leaders capable of committing their men to any imaginable idiocy

 The deeper into the burrows you went and the farther from Monster territory the more complex the technology the more extensive the knowledge and the more powerful the conceptual daring

 I pushed my hand farther around her

 She ll be farther from it unless she pays her bills

 They cursed the dogs in German lands farther north who had never heard of Uri

 But she knows of ropes and knows this magic is not from them that they direct her farther up and so she climbs the ladder and lifts the trap with her head

 She hits the bell again with the mallet as hard as she can and the touch goes farther

 A few steps farther on a dozen men sat at a wooden table of roughhewn planks

 Remus seemed very ugly to me then and I wished he d ride farther on

 I hoped that you would wander farther

 You won t have to share a room anymore with an old snoring monk he said and his smile was so sad one would have thought I was moving farther away than down the two flights of stairs

 I have read that limestone is composed of ancient shells and the Duft shells must have been particularly cavernous because like the seashell of our cochlea they trapped all the sounds emitted in that giant house and transmitted them farther

 I will go no farther she snapped until you say at least six words to me

 And then my voice reached farther into the earth below the house and out into the sky and soon I knew I was making the whole world shake just as my mother had rung the world with her bells

 Beneath them my lungs expanded farther The Largest Lungs in Europe one London reviewer would boast many years later

 The infinite space above me pulled me farther from my prison

 Assuming I had imagined the vision I moved farther down the street ready to retreat to the abbey

 Farther along the alley from whence I had come a window was lit

 Then I went still farther up wide curving stairs into empty bedrooms with bulging mattresses up up to tiny attic rooms one in which a young student slept his snores stinking of spirits 

 Indeed there is no better place for us for there is no place on earth farther from Staudach s abbey

 And then farther on were several girls admiring a newly made duke

 When the coachman said he would go no farther I offered to pay him double

 As it turned out the drop to the floor was farther than I had expected and I soon found myself sprawled in broken glass

 So now I look forward to spending a lot more time with him farther on up the road

 Then as another gust shoved the ship farther off course the seaman slipped and again the wheel spun out of their grasp

 The bandit leader walked into the space between his movements jerky and shouted angrily at the other samurai pointing at Blackthorne and then farther back to where the ambush had taken place

 What did you say Eh The bosun s mouth dropped farther open

 Again the rumbling deeper now and more growling but farther off

 Listen You d be better and safer to go farther over the mountains

 All the fishing boats had been hauled to safety much farther up the beach than usual

 Today the two daimyos were alone on the dais the cushions farther apart under a lower sky

 The farther from the castle the meaner were the roads the poorer the dwellings

 A little farther off samurai guarded a pile of short swords and long swords spears shields axes bows and arrows that porters were unloading from pack horses

 Priests came forward and put more wood onto the pyre and the flames rose farther the smoke billowing

 Half a ri ahead were the Jesuit wharves and warehouses and a hundred paces farther he could see the Portuguese ship

 Please excuse me may I suggest their final objective be a little farther the crest of the Shiomi Slope

 She went farther out into the courtyard shading herself with her scarlet umbrella to seek Toranaga

 Farther along the gallery she glanced into a case and saw a small statue of Pan formed of opaque green glass

 We reasoned that if anyone noticed that you had disappeared the investigation would get no farther than the door of the mansion

 Louisa was trying to soften it make it all seem rather matter of fact You see even if you were to marry a colored boy I mean if you were to make up your mind that that was what you wanted for yourself and Michie Philippe was willing and your Maman was willing and well you see Augustin Dumanoir is a planter s son ch re a planter s son with land that goes on farther back from the river than the eye can see and I m not saying that Richard Lermontant won t make some nice girl a fine husband why if you want to know the perfect truth chere I have always liked Richard Lermontant just about the best

 And revealing to Marie purely and so honestly the secrets of a woman s body the passions to which all women were subject be they sheltered or experienced innocent or skilled Dolly had led her farther and farther away from the voices of the past which had only deceived distorted betrayed

 They find a small two bedroom home in Randolph a quiet middle class town a little farther outside Boston

 She lowered her voice even farther so she could barely hear herself What if somebody opens one Dogcollar gave her a pained look

 The invisible cord between them stretched farther

 The farther we are from any massive abject the easier to control the jump to make re emergence into space at exactly desired co ordinates

 To the north were the towers of Galactic University obscuring the comparatively squat but wide Library most of which was underground and the remains of the Imperial Palace still farther north

 He pushed it farther back a though he cared nothing for that and rose

 My father and I were immigrants from Smyrno and the Mayor had a grandmother who Yes yes said Trevize impatiently and several generations farther back you can trace ancestry to the Sirius Sector

 Why would we have to look further than that The small card receptacle at the farther rim of the table glittered unobtrusively and the figures representing the cost of the meal flashed briefly

 Once this present crisis was over there was no telling how much farther he might advance

 After a pause Trevize said Gaia S is a single star or if it has a companion that companion is much farther away from it than we are at the present moment and it is at best a red dwarf which means we need not be concerned with it

 No even farther back than that

 Before he d gotten much farther he realized their purpose to detain him

 This can go no farther than this room but I ve suspected for some time Lieutenant that Professor Ossmann was as much an agent provocateur for the university administration as an active consultant

 Melvin Bricklesby made it as far as our base camp in but turned back when his porters wouldn t go any farther

 And now our escorts from one of the small tribes along the tributary refuse to go any farther

 He was leaning even farther across the table his voice a loud whisper

 The wind picked up high in the trees and the snow deepened the farther I penetrated into the wilderness

 Don t go any farther

 Before long more ships came bearing settlers for the new land and the city grew and pushed its boundaries farther and farther out

 As the years passed the two brothers grew farther and farther apart and their separate kingdoms became richer and grander

 I held out my hand but just then I saw a flash of pink farther down the beach

 He looked at the check in slip a moment longer before he put it back in the box then turned back to me his lazy hair falling farther over one eye

 I pushed my arm back farther my cardigan sweater catching on a shrub and finally I felt the cold metal of the key

 The nurse Ingrid was a great storyteller and she had told Margret many stories of the skraelings and their evil ways and of the sad lives of little girls whom the skraelings stole and took with them into the north farther north than the Northsetur where Hauk Gunnarsson hunted for walrus and narwhal

 Then he quickly grabbed his short spear and drove it down into the bear s breast and so quickly did all of this happen that the she bear made no noise and the cub foraging farther down the cliffside did not even look around

 Nicholas wanted to go farther and farther north even though the Greenlanders assured him that soon the ship would come to the land at the foot of the Greenland bottom and they pointed out to him the way that the shore turned westward and the western shore too could be seen in fine weather

 Asgeir himself the bishop said is a beloved member of our flock and now at the end of a long winter when the shepherd has been absent from the flock for many months many of the sheep have lost the way and some have strayed farther into the mountains than others and are in danger of being forever lost

 Egg laying time is even farther away

 After a while these sessions with Martin became fewer and the king with his court seemed farther and farther away

 He stood up and whistled to the gray horse as he was in the habit of doing with his own horse but the stallion paid no heed and walked farther off

 But the farmers who lived farther away and the bishop as well considered that Gunnar and Olaf had been within their rights and that it was Skuli who had risked outlawry in pursuing his liaison with a married woman

 She made no response but went down the hillside and kicked the cooking stones even farther apart

 With the bleating of the ewes and the crying of the lambs there was such a clamor that neither Asta nor Margret who was farther down the hillside noticed the approach of two skin boats until they were drawn up on the shore and the skraelings in them had already gotten out and begun to cook their meal over a fire they built

 After this she took Sigurd farther down the slope so that there would be no chance of his coming against the vat of milk or disturbing it in any way

 In return she presented him with an ancient ram s horn she had found near the old steading farther up the fjord and when she came into the steading she could see that Koll had not yet come and of this she was somewhat glad for it seemed to her when he did come that it fell upon her as mistress to put a stop to these visits and yet she could not bring herself to do it and made many excuses and so he came like this every half year drawing mistress and servant deeper and deeper into sin

 After the servingman departed with a promise to listen for word of any farms that needed servants during the winter Margret told Sigurd that she felt uncommonly low for this was the effect of unexpected company to leave you more in silence than you had been and farther from others

 But then as he was turning away he saw that there was another rider a bit farther away

 Now Gunnar went to the paddock himself in search of a horse to borrow but the paddock was full of mares with unweaned foals and so he had to look farther afield and the result was that when he had finally mounted all of the riders including Kollgrim were nowhere to be seen

 Now it happened that every boat exerted itself to the utmost and many seals were driven upon shore and killed with clubs and spears and this went on for six days so that the seals were chased farther north than ever they had been before well past the middle settlement and men felt they had done well with the hunt

 From his knowledge Finn saw two things which he told in a low voice to Kollgrim and one of these was that the best place on the north side of the island for herding the animals into the water was farther from the main herd than the Greenlanders would be able to take them for reindeer are not like sheep and can be held together only for a little ways even with many dogs especially if the herd is small

 And the seals swam fast faster than a man in a boat could row so that the men were exhausted and weakened at the end of each day and the main body of seals was farther and farther away from them

 In fact it seemed to him that he was himself again Sira Audun the same man he had been all his life self satisfied easily annoyed content with his own schemes and far from the Lord farther than he had ever known himself to be

 He chastised me and told me that I would be of little use to him if I couldn t even carry a message and he had me beaten every time I swooned at a new commission but he could not induce me to leave him and I stayed beside him from that day forward and soon enough he left off for isn t it the case that the child must always endure if he is stubborn enough And so it happened that from that time on until we came to Greenland and after I had never been apart from my uncle farther than the distance from one end of a farm field to another

 Their careful robes and their headdresses which many women had given up now made him feel as far from Europe as he had ever felt in his life farther perhaps than it was possible to be from Europe measured in mere travel

 Gunnar read aloud what he had written In these years the farmers of Herjolfsnes were cut off more and more from the rest of the Greenlanders but Snaebjorn Bjarnarson and the other principal landowners of the district refused to abandon their steadings and take up available steadings farther to the north

 She wrenched her elbow from Kollgrim s grip and they skated onwards somewhat farther apart

 It was the case with Kollgrim that he went out with his weapons on skis or in his boat and each day it seemed to him that he should go farther for he was the sort of man of whom it is said that he is led by the eyes not the wits

 In Hvalsey Fjord the winter weather was somewhat colder and snowier than it was in districts farther inland and it seemed to Gunnar that he and his household folk had a difficult time of it this year for indeed he saw that everyone was old now and more or less afflicted with the joint ill or other ills

 And after going about Vatna Hverfi district Jon Andres went farther south to where he had other farms and he found what support he could find there and Gunnar went about Hvalsey Fjord and over the hills to Kambstead Fjord

 But Snorri Torfason was more than willing to take Bolli Bjornsson with him and Thorstein Olafsson was as ardent a suitor as a man could be and though Sigrid would find herself much farther off than Herjolfsnes Thorstein had so confused and subdued her that if she thought of it she did not complain of it

 Did you know Macros well The trader sat back farther allowing his left arm to hang over the back of his chair in a relaxed pose

 It would have been a sign of better breeding or higher pretentions to be terribly sensitive about it to complain of it all the time and to yearn for a townhouse or even a small estate farther inland

 When Hackworth had performed this stunt as a youth he had discovered that the farther it got from its appointed place the hotter it became all the while politely informing him in clipped military diction that he had best release it or fall victim to vaguely adumbrated consequences

 Within a few minutes Hackworth had crossed a bridge into Pudong and was navigating narrow ravines between illuminated skyscrapers heading for the coast a few miles farther to the east

 The tendrils went even farther than that Judge Fang had known this for a long time

 It failed again but not before Princess Nell and her friends had gotten a little farther into the castle

 In response the Constable moved his feet about an inch farther apart than they had been and pooched his belly out which was apparently the chosen stance of some mysterious Scottish fighting technique

 This triggered a series of dissolves like she d seen on old passives Her current view dissolved into a closeup of her feet trudging down a couple of steps which dissolved into a view from considerably farther down the mountain followed by a closeup of Princess Nell unscrewing her water bottle and drinking melted snow another view from farther down Nell sitting down for a rest a soaring eagle the approaching cloud layer big trees descending through the mist and finally Nell tramping wearily down the last ten steps which left her in a clearing in a dark coniferous forest carpeted with rust colored pine needles

 She looked into a high rise building farther inland apparently a foreign concession of some type where some Euros were holding a cocktail party some venturing onto the balcony with glasses of wine and doing some eavesdropping of their own

 She had penetrated farther into his soul than any lover

 Farther to the west steep hills rose from the paddies black with vegetation

 The Huang Pu stopped the advance of the Celestial Army toward the sea but having crossed the river farther inland it continued to move northward up the Pudong Peninsula at a walking pace driving before it flocks of starving peasants much like the ones who had been their harbingers in Shanghai

 The tunnels were lined with mediatronic images urging them forward into the deep it always seemed as though a warm dry well lit space awaited them just a bit farther down the line

 Giorgio Bramante leaned down farther and kissed him on the head an unusual unexpected gesture

 Morio what about you I paused on the step not wanting to go any farther until we d decided what we were going to do about it

 About fifteen feet farther the tunnel came to an end

 It probably just gets worse the farther you head into the forest

 Want to make a bet we overshot and are farther up the road deeper in the forest than we were when we headed toward the pond for your plant I gazed at the surrounding trees

 We slipped farther along the tunnel skirting fallen rocks and a few small sinkholes

 The farther we made our way into the heart of the club the more I understood why Menolly wanted to get here ahead of time

 For about half a minute she lay there woozy trying to get up and listening to William drawing the Hand s freak farther away

 The entire family had gathered at the main house those who lived in the outer buildings those who lived farther in the swamp everyone came for the dinner before the fight

 Had I been a husband had I been a father I shall die alone abandoned by my lover Lay me down gently I ll go no farther Lay me down gently 

 I leaned a touch farther from the peephole

 Might we not go farther though and say that anything which wounds the planet is evil and anything which preserves it or heals it is good Let me be the first to say that the idea is sappy whatever that means

 I was happy to speak from that set as a descendent of immigrants who settled much farther inland immigrants about whom native New Yorkers often know nothing and imagine the worst

 If I had read a little farther we would have learned that there is a crowd outside crazy to see Lazarus not Jesus

 The box looked like an enormous square head and after I gave it a varnish I took the handsaw and widened the mouth farther opening up the corners a couple of centimeters on either side so the mouth was smiling

 I wanted to go farther into the cold sludge

 A lot farther

 The End Out the window I could see a pink dawn sky covering the backyard and probably farther at least to the corner store

 She and her friends kept edging farther down the platform so to keep my eyes on her I had to step out from my hiding place

 The houses now grand and flashy mansions were spaced farther apart

 Perhaps it was coincidence but in each photo she seemed to be farther and farther away from the camera lens as if she were shrinking

 He was suffering his far off eyes farther off than ever before

 The military supplies were scattered among towns farther north and Adams and Hancock moved to Lexington

 If the enemy begins to pursue us it is all up with him for the farther he advances from his bases of supply into a trackless and foodless country starved and encircled by an army of Cossacks his position will become more and more dangerous

 As the Western territories of America filled up pressure mounted for a farther north westerly move

 Under the hail of the French guns Wellington moved his infantry farther back over the ridge of Waterloo to give them a little more shelter

 Loose dirt rained down around her as she continued to scrabble sliding ten feet farther before landing on a hard rock floor

 A sweet fragrance grew heavier as she moved farther and farther away from the cave

 Then I couldn t go one bit farther

 Kale thought she d been too tired to go much farther but now a shiver of fear energized her muscles

 She only rarely caught a glimpse of Leetu farther ahead

 Rumor has it they ve been spotted near waterways farther and farther from the swamps

 Is she weakening Is she farther away Is she dying Leetu No response

 Kale continued At first I thought they might be moving her and sometimes we were right on their heels about to catch up and sometimes they leapt ahead much farther than could be possible if they are truly going around and around in these same tunnels

 On the back of Celisse as her strong wings carried them farther and farther from The Bogs the librarian told stories one after another

 Not much farther Librettowit called to his companions

 Not much farther Librettowit called again

 Not much farther Librettowit repeated

 Kale resisted the urge to ask how much farther they had to go

 MOVING HEAVEN AND EARTH With each tunnel they turned into the questing party moved farther away from the underground populace

 How much farther Leetu asked Librettowit

 I don t want to go any farther

 This time from the cami n the pelado made again that gesture of hopelessness which was also like a gesture of sympathy what could they do he appeared trying to convey to them through the window how could they have known when they got out that they could do nothing Move his hat farther down though so that he can get some air the Consul said in a voice that betrayed a trembling tongue Hugh did this and so swiftly he did not have time to see the money again also placed the Consul s handkerchief over the wound leaving it held in place by the balanced sombrero

 An American couple had just climbed up the scaffolding farther down a woman in a dove grey suit and a man with hornrimmed spectacles a slight stoop and hair worn long at the back who looked like an orchestra conductor it was the couple Hugh and she had seen before in the z calo at a corner Novedades buying huaraches and strange rattles and masks and then later from the bus on the church steps watching the natives dancing

 It was only that the little boat of their conversation had been moored precariously she could hear it banging against the rocks later she would drag it up farther where it was safe

 Move his hat farther down though so he can get some air

 Or back a little farther still Hugh to your Shelley s when it was poor little defenceless Greece Cervantes As it will be again of course

 I m sorry it was a mistake he hears her say as she goes farther away from him

 A little farther south there is a good deal of pine as well but right along in here at this time of year the only touches of green to be seen were cedar brakes and solitary holly trees and a few big cypresses down in the bottoms

 Rooster and I were behind them and a good deal farther away from them than LaBoeuf

 From time to time LaBoeuf and I would interrupt Rooster and ask him how much much farther and he would reply It is not far now and then he would pick up again on a chapter in the long and adventurous account of his life

 A little farther along we came across a bandit armed with a shotgun and squatting behind a big slab of limestone
